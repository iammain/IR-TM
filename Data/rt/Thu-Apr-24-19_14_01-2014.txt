Nathan Deal has signed a new law into effect – nicknamed the “guns everywhere bill” – that allows individuals to carry weapons into bars, schools, and even some churches and government buildings.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bf/c0/00/guns-everywhere-georgia-law-friendly.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (Reuters / Davis Turner)" /> <p> Officially titled the “Safe Carry Protection Act of 2014,” the bill easily sailed through the state legislature and was signed by Deal on Wednesday. The bill doesn’t officially go into effect until July 1, but it will permit those with gun licenses to carry weapons into numerous public spaces, even parts of the airport – which, in Atlanta, is the busiest in the US. </p><p> If a bar owner does not want to allow guns into their establishment, they will have the ability to “opt out” – a change from previous law which stated bars had to “opt in” to permit firearms. Meanwhile, church leaders who don’t mind having visitors enter with weapons will be able to opt in as well. </p><p> <em>"Our state has some of the best protections for gun owners in the United States,”</em> Deal said as he signed the bill, according to USA Today. <em>“And today we strengthen those rights protected by our nation's most revered founding document.</em> </p><p> <em>“People who follow the rules can protect themselves and their families from people who don’t follow the rules,”</em> he added. <em>“The Second Amendment should never be an afterthought. It should reside at the forefronts of our minds.”</em> </p><p> The bill was supported by gun-rights activists and the National Rifle Association, which called it <em>"the most comprehensive pro-gun reform legislation introduced in recent history."</em> </p><p> Opponents like the gun-control group Americans for Responsible Solutions, however, called the bill the most extreme gun law in the United States, claiming it <em>"moves Georgia out of the mainstream."</em> </p><p> <em>"Among its many extreme provisions, it allows guns in TSA lines at the country's busiest airport, forces community school boards into bitter, divisive debates about whether they should allow guns in their children's classrooms, and broadens the conceal carry eligibility to people who have previously committed crimes with guns,"</em> ARS senior advisor Pia Carusone told CNN. </p><p> Other groups oppose the fact that the bill will let people carry firearms into government buildings that don’t feature security measures like metal detectors. This includes public libraries, city halls, recreational centers, and fire stations. Notably, guns will still not be allowed at the state Capitol. </p><p> The bill also removes obstacles previously put in place to keep those convicted of select misdemeanors from acquiring gun permits. This detail was opposed by law enforcement agencies, which will not be allowed to detain individuals <em>"for the sole purpose of investigating whether such a person has a weapons carry license."</em> </p><p> Speaking with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Deal defended the bill, arguing that the more controversial aspects were dropped – including a provision that would have allowed guns on campuses across the state. </p><p> <em>“There are always opportunities for people to use any piece of legislation as a political tool if they don’t like it,”</em> he said. <em>“But there was bipartisan support for the bill. The main story that should come out of it is the final product is significantly different from earlier versions.”</em> </p><p> Still, at least one church leader in Georgia – Rev. Raphael Warnock – seemed perplexed by the law, telling CNN, <em>"No one asked for this bill but the gun lobby, and still, we're here.”</em> He noted that the majority of the churches in the state are trying to deal with issues like education and healthcare, not guns. </p><p> <em>"I don't know of a single pastor in the state of Georgia who has been lobbying to have guns brought into their churches,"</em> he said. <em>"When we say pass the peace, we mean P-E-A-C-E, not the P-I-E-C-E."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154548-pictures-russian-troops-false/</guid><title><![CDATA[US State Dept and NYT ‘photo evidence’ case collapses]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154548-pictures-russian-troops-false/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bb/40/00/pictures-russian-troops-false-.jpg" title="Screenshot from nytimes.com"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 16:34:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/bb/40/00/pictures-russian-troops-false-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Pictures presented by Washington and Kiev as evidence of Russia's involvement in Ukraine, and published on Monday by the New York Times, were unverified and in fact contradicted the claims they were to support.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bb/40/00/pictures-russian-troops-false-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Screenshot from nytimes.com" /> <p> The US State department acknowledged the error and the New York Times back-tracked on its Monday story, which claimed “<em>photographs and descriptions from eastern Ukraine endorsed by the Obama administration … suggest that many of the green men are indeed Russian military and intelligence forces</em>”. </p><p> The proof was this particular picture with an inscription “Group photograph taken in Russia”. </p><p> </p><p> Freelance photographer Maxim Dondyuk took the photo. </p><p> “<em>It was taken in Slavyansk [Ukraine],</em>” he told NYT over the phone. “<em>Nobody asked my permission to use it.</em>” </p><p> The picture was amongst others Kiev gave the OSCE mission to Ukraine to ‘prove’ Russian involvement in the massive unrest gripping the Donetsk region. </p><p> The State Department repeated the claims, citing ‘confirmation’ of Moscow involvement. </p><p> “We see in the photos that have been again in international media, on Twitter, publicly available is that there are individuals who visibly appear to be tied to Russia.

She explained the picture was only part of a draft packet that wasn’t used by Kerry at the talks. </p><p> Psaki then claimed to have other evidence connecting “<em>the Russians and the armed militants</em>” in eastern Ukraine but would not provide details. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154580-journalist-ntv-russian-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Producer of Russian TV show vanishes in Ukraine as ‘saboteurs posing as journalists’ detained]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154580-journalist-ntv-russian-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bd/40/00/journalist-ntv-russian-ukraine.jpg" title="Stepan Chirich (Image from facebook.com)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 16:23:44 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/bd/40/00/journalist-ntv-russian-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A producer for a popular program on Russia’s NTV channel has disappeared in eastern Ukraine where he came to film a report unrelated to the country’s political situation.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bd/40/00/journalist-ntv-russian-ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Stepan Chirich (Image from facebook.com)" /> <p> Belarusian citizen Stepan Chirchich, a producer for the weekly program Central Television, went to the city of Pershotravinsk in the Dnepropetrovsk region to make a report about the visit of a well-known exorcist, Pastor Bob Larson, who’s there as part of his world tour. </p><p> “<em>We lost contact with [Chirchich] on Tuesday evening,</em>” Vadim Takmenyov, the program’s host, told RT. He said that at the beginning they did not ring the alarm, but now he has been missing for over two days the channel is doing everything possible to find the producer. </p><p> Chirchich has been working for the program for several years. </p><p> “<em>We sent him to Ukraine – a producer, not a correspondent – because he is the only Central Television employee who has a Belarusian passport, using which one can cross the [Russian-Ukrainian] border without any problems and do his professional activities,</em>” Takmenyov said. </p><p> Takmenyov underlined that political events in the crisis-torn country were completely unrelated to that particular trip. </p><p> A cameraman who was working with the missing NTV producer was a Ukrainian citizen from Lugansk, in eastern Ukraine. There is no connection with him either and his relatives as well as employees have no idea what happened to him, the NTV journalist said. </p><p> The channel says that the disappearance of the crew might be connected with reports about the detention of two suspected Russian “<em>saboteurs</em>” in Dnepropetrovsk region. According to Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, two men “<em>pretending to be journalists</em>” were grabbed by local militia and passed over to the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) after filming a police station and the city council in Pershotravinsk. Citing unofficial sources, the paper said the unnamed men had Belarusian passports, but equipment they used “indicated their relation to Russian intelligence.” </p><p> “<em>We got through to the SBU. The only comment we managed to get was ‘No comment,</em>’” Takmenyov said. </p><p> He said the channel sent to its colleagues in Ukraine documents proving that Chirchich has nothing to do with any intelligence services. </p><p> “<em>We hope [journalists in Ukraine] will report on [the incident] in one or another way, but fairly, and say that we are looking for our colleague,</em>” the NTV journalist added in a telephone comment to RT. </p><p> Following the February coup in Kiev, Russian journalists and TV crews have repeatedly been <a href="http://rt.com/news/ruptly-journalist-ukraine-ban-889/" target="_blank">denied entry</a> to Ukraine on various pretexts.The new authorities also accused several Russian television channels of propaganda and ordered local cable providers to cut them off. Later, some providers – primarily in eastern Ukraine – resumed broadcast of Russian channels. </p><p> Earlier in April, the Russian upper house of parliament said in a statement that Russian journalists “<em>are facing psychological and physical pressure in Ukraine</em>” while the country’s online media reporting on the crisis “<em>is being attacked by hackers</em>.” </p><p> Last week, a journalist and a camerawoman for Russia’s LifeNews were <a href="http://rt.com/news/lifenews-journalist-detained-ukraine-248/" target="_blank">detained and questioned</a> for many hours by Ukraine law enforcers. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154604-heartbleed-linux-core-initiative/</guid><title><![CDATA[Internet giants unite to fight against a second Heartbleed]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154604-heartbleed-linux-core-initiative/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/be/c0/00/google_-facebook_-microsoft-team-up-to-prevent-another-heartbleed.jpg" title="Image from heartbleed.com"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 16:00:56 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/be/c0/00/google_-facebook_-microsoft-team-up-to-prevent-another-heartbleed.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​In the wake of what’s been called the biggest computer bug to ever affect the internet, tech giants including Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel and Cisco have started a non-profit organization aimed at preventing another Heartbleed.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/be/c0/00/google_-facebook_-microsoft-team-up-to-prevent-another-heartbleed.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Image from heartbleed.com" /> <p> The <a href="http://rt.com/news/heartbleed-encryption-security-bug-269/" target="_blank">discovery</a> of that major glitch last month revealed that the open-source program used to encrypt and protect sensitive data across roughly two-thirds of the web was exploitable for nearly two years, theoretically compromising an immeasurable amount of credit card information, passwords and just about everything else meant to be secured by the OpenSSL protocol. </p><p> On Thursday this week, the Linux Foundation <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/core-infrastructure-initiative" target="_blank">announced</a> the creation of the Core Infrastructure Initiative, or CII — a multi-million dollar endeavor intended to fund and support critical elements of the global information infrastructure, according to a statement on the non-profit’s website. </p><p> <em>“After the Heartbleed crisis we asked ourselves: How did this happen and what role can The Linux Foundation play to be sure it doesn’t happen again?”</em> Amanda McPherson, the chief marketing officer of The Linux Foundation, asked Klint Finley at <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/cii/" target="_blank">Wired</a> this week. <em>“We decided to do what we always do: work with the industry to raise money and fund developers directly so they can do what they do best, develop, while we give them the assistance the way we do Linus Torvalds.”</em> </p><p> Torvalds — the Finnish-American software engineer credited with developing the open-source Linux kernel used to power the operating system of the same name — has for years been hailed by many in the tech community for the contributions he’s made by opening up his projects for other developers to improve upon. The CII now hopes that with the help of a dozen backers, other open-source engineers working on endeavors critical to the future of the web will be able to receiving the sufficient funding and support to help perfect those projects. </p><p> OpenSSL, Finley wrote for Wired, is run by a team of just four programmers, essentially putting one of the internet’s most important tools in the hands of a team with <em>“limited time to test and audit and perfect the project’s code.”</em> </p><p> Countless other projects have it even worse, however, and the inability to conduct those audits may once again allow for another Heartbleed to silently emerge and stay undetected for two years. On Wednesday, Linux Foundation Executive Director Jim Zemlin told the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/companies-back-initiative-to-support-openssl-and-other-open-source-projects/" target="_blank">New York Times</a> that the CII will work to not only help make sure programmers have the resources to keep their projects afloat, but that they’ll also be able to efficiently collaborate in a post-Heartbleed environment. </p><p> <em>“This is not just about the money, but the forum,”</em> Zemlin told Nicole Perlroth at the Times. <em>“Instead of responding to a crisis retroactively, this is an opportunity to identify crucial open-source projects in advance. Right now, nobody is having that conversation, and it’s an important conversation to have.”</em> </p><p> In addition to the aforementioned Silicon Valley giants, Amazon, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, NetApp, RackSpace and VMware have all signed-on to support the CII and agreed to each pledge $100,000 annually over the next three years.Combined, the 12 companies that are currently members of the consortium have pledged, at a minimum, a total of $3.6 million. </p><p> But after <a href="http://rt.com/usa/nsa-knew-heartbleed-hacking-years-004/" target="_blank">reports</a> emerged in the aftermath of the Heartbleed scandal accusing the United States National Security Agency of knowing about the bug since nearly the beginning, the millions of dollars amassed by the CII might not be enough to outmatch the US government. Earlier this month, Bloomberg News reported that the NSA knew about the massive vulnerability for years but failed to alert Silicon Valley, and instead used the exploit to attack foreign targets. The NSA has since dismissed those allegations as false but, nevertheless, proper testing and auditing — backed with a few million dollars — are likely to ensure that at least a couple important web projects receive enough funding to keep from falling victim to an exploit like OpenSSL did. </p><p> <em>"Maintaining the health of the community projects that produce software critical to the security and safety of Internet commerce is in everyone's interest,"</em> Professor Eben Moglen of Columbia Law School said in a statement released by the CII on Thursday. <em>"The Linux Foundation, and the companies joining this Initiative, are enabling these dedicated programmers to continue maintaining and improving the free and open source software that makes the net work safely for us all."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154508-china-pollution-environmental-law/</guid><title><![CDATA[Choking crisis: China imposes stricter penalties against polluters]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154508-china-pollution-environmental-law/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b8/c0/00/china-pollution-environmental-law-.jpg" title="Hong Kong, China (Reuters / Tyrone Siu)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 15:59:41 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b8/c0/00/china-pollution-environmental-law-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Chinese authorities have introduced amendments to the country’s Environmental Protection Law imposing tougher penalties on polluters, legislation that comes amid a growing environmental crisis that is choking the country.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b8/c0/00/china-pollution-environmental-law-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Hong Kong, China (Reuters / Tyrone Siu)" /> <p> The amendments passed by the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), the country's top legislature, will come into effect in January 2015. </p><p> It is the first change to the legislation in 25 years. The country’s Environmental Protection Law was introduced in 1989. </p><p> The changes come in the wake of public concern over the high level of pollution in the country as well as a two-year debate among scholars, the government and state-owned enterprises over changes to environmental protection policies. </p><h2> Tightening the screws </h2><p> According to Xin Chunying, deputy director of the Standing Committee’s Legislative Affairs Commission, the legislation would deliver <em>"a blow ... to our country's harsh environmental realities,"</em> Reuters reported. </p><p> It will enable the Environmental Protection Ministry to take stronger punitive action toward polluters, including shutting down and confiscating their assets. The amendments will also make public the information on environmental monitoring and introduce a daily-based fine system to punish offenders. </p><p> The law says that those responsible for environmental pollution will face up to 15 days under arrest if their enterprise produces or uses forbidden pesticides and refuses to suspend production after being issued a ban. </p><p> </p><p> Chinese legislators also introduced an <em>“ecological red line"</em> that will declare certain regions off-limits for polluting industries. The law also contains special articles and provisions on tackling smog as well as making citizens more aware of environmental protection. </p><p> Local officials may be demoted or sacked, if they are guilty of covering up environment-related wrongdoing, falsifying data or if they don’t give closure orders to enterprises which illegally discharge pollutants, the amendments say. </p><p> June 5 has also been declared Environment Day in the country. </p><h2> China’s environmental tragedy </h2><p> <em>"The biggest breakthrough is ... that [the ministry] have used a professional document to talk about the disclosure of environmental information and public participation,”</em> said Ma Jun, head of the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs, an independent environmental group. <em>“This, in fact, establishes some of the public's basic environmental rights."</em> </p><p> The Chinese government has been trying to introduce policies to clean up the environment, including <em>“cloud seeding”</em> – artificial rain – to disperse the smog that affects the majority of the country’s cities. </p><p> The smog has become so thick it is impeding photosynthesis, potentially disrupting China’s food supply. According to an associate professor at China Agricultural University, He Dongxian, if air pollution continues at the same rate, China will experience something akin to a <em>“nuclear winter.”</em> </p><p> According to China’s deputy minister of environmental protection, 71 out of 74 cities monitored in China for pollution in 2013 fail to meet Beijing-set standards. </p><p> The deteriorating quality of drinking water is considered one of the country’s major problems. According to an annual report by China’s Ministry of Land and Resources, at least <a href="http://rt.com/news/154268-underground-water-china-polluted/" target="_blank">60 percent</a> of underground water is polluted in the country. </p><p> The enormous rate of the water pollution in the country sparked new concerns in April after cancer-inducing <a href="http://rt.com/news/china-benzene-water-scare-996/" target="_blank">benzene</a> was found in water supply in the city of Lanzhou, which is considered one of the most polluted in the country. </p><p> The soil is also massively polluted across the country. According to a report released earlier in April on the website of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, one-fifth of Chinese farmland is polluted as a result of the country’s dramatic industrialization, overuse of farm chemicals and minimal environmental protection. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154616-bundy-ranch-government-helicopters-shoot/</guid><title><![CDATA[Bundy ranch stand-off: Government helicopters shot cattle multiple times 'for fun']]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154616-bundy-ranch-government-helicopters-shoot/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bf/80/00/bundy-ranch-government-helicopters-shoot.jpg" title="Rancher Cliven Bundy poses for a photo outside his ranch house on April 11, 2014 west of Mesquite, Nevada (Reuters / George Frey)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 15:36:50 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/bf/80/00/bundy-ranch-government-helicopters-shoot.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />As the ongoing saga between Nevada ranch owner Cliven Bundy and the federal government continues, the rancher’s son claims federal agents killed multiple cattle during their roundup, shooting some animals up to five times.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bf/80/00/bundy-ranch-government-helicopters-shoot.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Rancher Cliven Bundy poses for a photo outside his ranch house on April 11, 2014 west of Mesquite, Nevada (Reuters / George Frey)" /> <p> The stand-off began earlier this month, when the Bureau of Land Management attempted to enforce a court order and seize nearly 1,000 head of cattle raised by Bundy. The agency claimed the rancher owed taxpayers $1 million in grazing fees that he stopped paying back in 1993. Bundy, however, disputed the allegation and said he owed the government nothing, and that his ancestors had been using that land since the late 1800s. </p><p> When the BLM showed up with hundreds of armed federal agents and began rounding up the cattle, almost 1,000 people came to Bundy’s aide – armed militia from multiple states and others who believed the government was overstepping its bounds. In order to avoid escalation, the BLM released the hundreds of cattle it had collected back into Bundy’s custody, confirming it would continue its case in the courts. </p><p> Speaking with Breitbart.com on Wednesday, Bundy’s son, Ammon Bundy, said some of the cattle had been killed, accused the BLM of using helicopters during its roundup, and said agents used “inhumane” methods to gather the animals. </p><p> <em>“Well we know that two bulls were shot. And the one that they threw up in the mountain, Nickelcrick, he had a shot from above. He was shot by helicopter, but then he had four other shots to him as well. It looks like a fun shoot,”</em> said the younger Bundy adding, <em>“One hit him in the head and it ripped his whole face up. It was almost like a fun shoot.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> For its part, the BLM acknowledged that four cattle were killed, but stated officials “euthanized” them, and that two died during the roundup. </p><p> <em>“The Bundy branded bull that was euthanized posed a significant threat to employees during the gather. The Bundy branded cow ran into a fence panel injuring its spine and was euthanized,”</em> an unnamed BLM official told Breitbart. </p><p> The agency did not say whether its roundup involved the use of helicopters – a controversial practice that opponents claim frightens animals, forces them to run for miles, and can cause potential injury. </p><p> <em>“Since Saturday they were in gathering this cattle by helicopter,”</em> Ammon Bundy claimed. <em>“They were pushing them all. When you do it that way, it was 90 degrees that week—in the 90’s, those cattle run too hard and it’s very difficult on them and they’ll overheat and die, but also this is calving season right now. So these cows are aborting their calves and they’re also separating their newborn babies from their mothers.”</em> </p><p> Bundy also accused the BLM of dragging the cattle through the dirt by their necks, but said an autopsy would be necessary before knowing if that was done before or after the cattle had died. </p><p> Meanwhile, Cliven Bundy made headlines Wednesday evening as well, when he questioned whether African Americans were better off as slaves to a New York Times reporter. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro,”</em> Bundy said, describing a time he passed a public-housing project in Las Vegas. <em>“In front of that government house the door was usually open and the older people and the kids — and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the porch — they didn’t have nothing to do. They didn’t have nothing for their kids to do. They didn’t have nothing for their young girls to do.</em> </p><p> <em>“And because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do?”</em> he asked. <em>“They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I’ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.”</em> </p><p> Asked about these statements, lawmakers who had come out in support of Bundy’s conflict with the government quickly said they did not share those beliefs. Speaking with the Times, a spokeswoman for Sen.

While Slavyansk activists told RT young soldiers were sent to shoot at them with <a href="http://rt.com/news/ukraine-troops-withdraw-slavyansk-940/" target="_blank">no food supplies</a>, some of the Ukrainian soldiers who surrendered to the locals told RIA Novosti they had to eat <em>“a nettle soup,”</em> which they gathered on the roadside. </p><p> Other video reports coming from Slavyansk on Thursday told a similar story to the men interrupting Phillips. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Ukrainian army drive off at high speed after <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Sloviansk&amp;src=hash">#Sloviansk</a> checkpoint attack, reports of fatalities. <a href="http://t.co/dChfXxmxN7">pic.twitter.com/dChfXxmxN7</a> </p>— GrahamWPhillips (@GrahamWP_UK) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamWP_UK/statuses/459269241095462912">April 24, 2014</a> </blockquote><p> Several Ukrainian troops <em>“put a number of locals face down on the ground although they had no weapons whatsoever, after that the military drove away the rest and seized all the food from the checkpoint that was brought by the people to the fellows standing guard,”</em> said a <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/russian-donetsk-2" target="_blank">witness</a> speaking to local activists on camera. </p><p> He added that one young activist was shot dead and another injured at a nearby checkpoint overnight.

But we, in fact, are protecting our own native city,”</em> an activist told Phillips. </p><p> The idea that the Ukrainian army is underfinanced is not just coming from media reports, but is a frequent subject of discussion in the Ukrainian parliament, now dominated by the former opposition parties. However, soon after stating that <em>“the treasury is empty,”</em> the coup-imposed Kiev government preferred not to raise financing of the regular troops on the ground, but instead formed the armed National Guard, whose members are being picked <em>“on the basis of patriotism.”</em> Initially gathered from the Maidan self-defense squads which helped bring down President Viktor Yanukovich and then sent to southeastern Ukraine, the National Guard has last week been <em>“urgently”</em> reinforced by additional units by an order of coup-imposed Ukrainian Security Service head Andrey Paruby. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154608-cornwall-uk-minority-rights/</guid><title><![CDATA[More than pirates ‘n’ pasties: Cornish get same minority rights as Scots]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154608-cornwall-uk-minority-rights/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bf/00/00/cornwall-uk-minority-rights.jpg" title="Reuters / Eddie Keogh"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 15:20:21 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/bf/00/00/cornwall-uk-minority-rights.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK government will announce Thursday that the Cornish, one of the ancient peoples of the British isles who trace their roots back to prehistoric times, will be formally recognized – along with the Scots, Welsh and Irish – as a national minority.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bf/00/00/cornwall-uk-minority-rights.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Eddie Keogh" /> <p> The decision has been taken under a European convention to protect the rights of national minorities and means that they will have the same rights and protections as the UK’s more established nationalities: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p><p> <em>“Cornish people have a proud history and a distinct identity. I am delighted that we have been able to officially recognize this and afford the Cornish people the same status as other minorities in the UK,”</em> said Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. </p><p> It is a millennium since this windswept corner of the British Isles was claimed by the English crown and 15 years since efforts began to have them formally recognized as a people in their own right. </p><p> The UK’s 2011 census saw 84,000 people declare themselves as Cornish and not English. Cornwall has a population of 560,000 people. In Cornwall’s schools, 41 percent of children described themselves as Cornish, compared to 34 percent in 2009. </p><p> The Cornish language – which was classified in 2010 by the United Nations as extinct – is also enjoying something of a revival, with 557 people now claiming it as their main language. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg promised a further £120,000 ($200,000) of government funding to help promote and develop the language through projects, such as an online radio station. </p><p> There are now dual language street signs all over Cornwall and the first Cornish-language kindergarten opened four years ago. </p><p> Thursday’s announcement comes after years of lobbying and the submission of two formal reports to Westminster seeking minority status. </p><p> There were also concerns that policies affecting Cornwall were being made in London, such as government plans to charge VAT on hot Cornish pasties, dubbed the <em>“pasty tax”</em> in 2012, which went ahead despite protests. </p><p> <em>“We are absolutely elated,”</em> said Dick Cole, the leader of Mebyon Kernow, the Cornish Nationalist Party. <em>“The fact that Cornish culture, language and identity are now formally a national minority on a par with the Welsh, Scots and Irish is fantastic. We shall savor the moment,”</em> he told the Independent. </p><p> The Cornish Nationalist Party is seeking to form a Cornish national assembly on the lines of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh National Assembly, although the British government has no plans to grant permission for this. </p><p> It is unclear what Thursday’s move by Westminster will mean in practice for the people of Cornwall, which is Britain’s poorest region and relies heavily on tourism as its main source of income. </p><p> David Penhaligon, the Liberal Democrat MP for the Cornish town of Truro until his death in 1986, famously said about Cornwall: <em>“You need more in an economy than just tourism, ice cream and deckchairs.”</em> </p><p> Recognition of the Cornish as a distinct people will be welcomed by many, but experts say it may do little to change the state of Cornish roads, high unemployment figures and the cuts to essential public services. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154612-israel-suspend-peace-talks/</guid><title><![CDATA[Israel suspends peace talks in response to Palestinian unity deal]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154612-israel-suspend-peace-talks/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bf/40/00/israel-suspend-peace-talks.jpg" title="Israel's chief negotiator and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni (R) turns to chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat (L) (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 14:55:13 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/bf/40/00/israel-suspend-peace-talks.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Israel’s security cabinet has suspended peace talks with the Palestinians in response to the unity deal between the PLO, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, and Hamas.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bf/40/00/israel-suspend-peace-talks.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Israel's chief negotiator and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni (R) turns to chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat (L) (AFP Photo)" /> <p> The Cabinet unanimously decided to cut off contacts after a five-hour meeting Thursday. The decision was announced in a statement sent to journalists, AP reports. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Cabinet decided that Israel will not negotiate with a Palestinian gov. backed by Hamas, a terrorist org. that calls for Israel's destruction </p> <p> — PM of Israel (@IsraeliPM) <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/statuses/459352912565927936">April 24, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> According to Israeli media, the country will also impose economic sanctions on the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Reuters reports. </p><p> On Wednesday, Israel canceled a planned session of peace talks with the Palestinians over the deal signed in Gaza between Hamas and President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction. </p><p> The two rival groups plan to form a unity government within five weeks and hold national elections a half-year after a vote of confidence by the Palestinian parliament. </p><p> <em>"Instead of choosing peace, Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas] made a deal with a murderous terror organization that calls for the destruction of Israel,”</em> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday, The Times of Israel reported. </p><p> </p><p> <em>"Hamas appealed to Muslims to kill Jews, fired over 10,000 rockets at Israel, and has not ceased for a moment from its terror activities against Israel,”</em> he said, adding, <em>”Whoever chooses Hamas’s terror does not want peace.”</em> </p><p> Netanyahu also lashed out at the timing of the reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, which he said occurred <em>“at a time when Israel was making efforts to advance the negotiations.”</em> <br><br> The Palestinian unity deal is a <em>“direct continuation of the Palestinian refusal to advance the talks,”</em> he said, referring to the Palestinian rejection of the US framework agreement, its refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state and President Abbas’s appeal to UN bodies for recognition. </p><p> The US State Department, commenting on the Palestinian agreement on Wednesday, said it was <em>“disappointing”</em> and <em>“raises concerns about our efforts to extend the negotiations.”</em> </p><p> The Israeli decision to halt the talks appears to bring to an end to the nine-month peace initiative by US Secretary of State John Kerry. The negotiating period was scheduled to end next Tuesday, but the sides had been trying to agree to an extension. </p><p> The US-sponsored talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority resumed in Washington in July last year, following a three-year stalemate. Abbas vowed he would suspend attempts to join UN agencies, while Israel promised to release 104 Palestinian prisoners in four groups. </p><p> However, the peace talks once again were on the verge of collapse earlier in April, with both sides taking what the US described as “unhelpful steps.” The Palestinians <a href="http://rt.com/news/abbas-seeks-un-recognition-721/" target="_blank">applied for admittance</a> to 15 UN agencies and conventions after Israel failed to release a fourth batch of prisoners in March and also re-issued tenders for hundreds of new homes at a Jewish settlement in occupied East Jerusalem. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/154576-sanctions-not-effective-putin/</guid><title><![CDATA[Sanctions 'not effective' in modern world - Putin]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/154576-sanctions-not-effective-putin/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bd/00/00/sanctions-help-russia-_-_-putin.jpg" title="President of Russia, attending the plenary meeting of the First Media Forum of independent regional and local mass media, held by the all-Russia People's Front in St.Petersburg, April 24, 2014 (AFP Photo / Sergey Guneev)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 14:38:33 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/bd/00/00/sanctions-help-russia-_-_-putin.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Sanctions against Russia will backfire and actually benefit the economy, President Vladimir Putin has said.

Similar to what Prime Minister Medvedev said last week, sanctions will only <a href="http://rt.com/business/154012-sanctions-russia-stronger-medvedev/" target="_blank">make Russia stronger</a>. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/business/offshore-russia-accounts-crackdown-353/">De-offshorization</a> has long been a priority of the Kremlin, and Western-led sanctions only help this cause. </p><p> Russians with Western-held assets worry their funds could be frozen at any moment, which gives incentives to keep money domestically and pay taxes into the Russian budget, and not an offshore tax haven. An estimated <a href="http://rt.com/business/offshore-tax-budget-russia-119/" target="_blank">$111 billion</a> of Russian money, or 20 percent of the country’s exports, is "lost" offshore, </p><p> Policymakers are also encouraging businesses to <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-urges-stock-russia-397/" target="_blank">list</a> their companies in Russia, and not abroad, to shield themselves from sanctions. </p><p> The first wave of US sanctions prompted a mix-up with Visa and Mastercard, which led to unlawful <a href="http://rt.com/business/visa-mastercard-russia-sanctions-285/" target="_blank">blocked</a> payment freezes at three Russian banks in March. Services shortly <a href="http://rt.com/business/visa-mastercard-us-sanctions-693/" target="_blank">resumed</a>, but President Putin thinks the disruption will lead to losses for the two giant credit card companies. </p><p> According to Putin, this was a <em>“very big mistake”</em>. </p><p> Putin said he believes the Visa and MasterCard payment systems will lose their market share in Russia -currently 90 percent- over any future payment disruptions. </p><p> <em>“I’m sure they are already aware of this,”</em> the president said. </p><p> <em>“I’m not talking about some administrative steps from our side. We do not envision any punishment steps for our dishonest partners. But they are undermining our credibility in them, which means they are absolutely certain to be losing market share,"</em> the president added. </p><p> Putin is worried that the payment systems will continue to <em>“cave”</em> under US pressure. </p><h2> Third Round of Sanctions </h2><p> On Wednesday, US President Obama said the US is ready to unleash a third round of sanctions against Russia, as tensions in eastern Ukraine haven’t deescalated, as agreed upon in last week’s Geneva peace plan. </p><p> New sanctions by the United States and Europe will likely target specific industries- like energy and banking <br> While sanctions against Russia have had some negative effects on the Russian economy, like a ratings cut and loans becoming more expensive, it hasn't been dramatic, Putin said. </p><p> <em>"On the whole, probably, [ratings] cause harm, because ratings are reviewed and loans can become more expensive, etc.,”</em> Putin said. </p><p> So far, two agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch have downgraded Russia's credit rating over the potential impact of US and EU sanctions. </p><p> Forecasters have cut their estimates for Russian growth in 2014, with the best case scenario at 2.5 precent, and the worst, <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-0-gdp-ukraine-836/">0 percent</a>. </p><p> The EU is holding off on a third stage of sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, as there is little consensus among member states. The council is considering economic measures, but won’t meet again until May 12 to discuss the matter. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/154584-russia-vacation-state-domestic/</guid><title><![CDATA[Authorities advise state companies to send employees to Russian resorts - Putin]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/154584-russia-vacation-state-domestic/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bd/80/00/russia-vacation-state-domestic.jpg" title="Sochi (RIA Novosti / Vladimir Fedorenko)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 14:03:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/bd/80/00/russia-vacation-state-domestic.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />State corporations have been advised to send their staff on vacations to Russian resorts, and President Vladimir Putin has told reporters that in his view private Russian companies should follow suit.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bd/80/00/russia-vacation-state-domestic.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Sochi (RIA Novosti / Vladimir Fedorenko)" /> <p> The president was speaking at a media forum in St Petersburg organized by the United People’s Front – a relatively new political movement uniting those who support Putin’s ideas but choose not to join the United Russia party. </p><p> Answering a question about recent rumors of bans on foreign vacations by various ministries and state-owned companies, Putin said that there were certain steps in this direction, but they were not restrictive. “<em>As far as the companies with state participation are concerned, we have already sent them our recommendations on how they could organize holidays for their employees in our domestic resorts</em>,” the Russian leader said. He also noted that private Russian companies also should not shun the domestic resorts: “<em>We should direct our companies towards sending their staff and their children to our health spas</em>.” </p><p> “<em>A lot has been done for this in Sochi, tens of billions of rubles were invested in the infrastructure, in construction of hotels - both the high class and ordinary, but attractively priced and of high quality</em>,” the head of state told reporters. </p><p> Earlier this week several Russian newspapers quoted unnamed sources in the Defence Ministry, Interior Ministry and several state law enforcement agencies as saying that there was a ban on employees going on vacations abroad. </p><p> Russian officials quickly dismissed these reports as untrue, but some details emerged from the subsequent explanations. </p><p> Nikolai Partrushev who heads Russia’s Security Council said that no travel bans had been imposed in any government department. The official added, however, that such restrictions had been pondered but only for those who had access to state secrets. </p><p> The Federal Drug Control agency said that its directors only asked staff to pay attention to a recent release in which the Foreign Ministry asked Russian citizens who suspected that they could have conflicts with US justice to abstain from travelling to countries that have valid extradition agreements with the United States. </p><p> The Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source in the Interior Ministry as saying that the ban existed, but it was classified and only concerned officers with high security clearance. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154504-fracking-benefits-millions-jobs/</guid><title><![CDATA[Up for shale: Fracking lobby claims UK gas could draw $55bn in investment]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154504-fracking-benefits-millions-jobs/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b8/80/00/fracking-benefits-millions-jobs.jpg" title="Demonstrators hold banners during an anti-fracking protest in central London (Reuters / Neil Hall)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 13:02:52 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b8/80/00/fracking-benefits-millions-jobs.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The exploitation of the UK’s shale gas reserves could create thousands of jobs and draw over $55 billion in investment, a report says.

The UK is thought to have abundant resources of shale gas, especially in the North which is estimated to contain around 1,329 trillion cubic feet, many times more than the annual gas consumption of 3 tcf. <br><br> To extract the hidden resources a controversial process known as fracking has to be employed. The practice entails the pumping of water and chemicals thousands of meters under the earth into fissures in the rock to release gas deposits. Reports by environmental groups have shown the practice can have detrimental effects on the environment, contaminating local water supplies and causing minor earthquakes. <br><br> Fracking was discontinued in the UK in 2011 after the practice was connected to several minor earthquakes close to the northern city of Blackpool, the largest of which measured 2.3 on the Richter scale. <br><br> Despite the environmental concerns, British Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to <em>“go all out”</em> for shale gas exploitation. He has championed the process as a way of drastically lowering energy bills in Britain and well as stimulating job creation. However, UKOOG has said billions of pounds of investment will be required in order to establish the necessary infrastructure in Britain. <br><br><em>“We are building an industry in this country which will not only give the UK energy security and make a big contribution in tax revenues but will also bring immense benefits to other industries and create sustainable, well-paid jobs,”</em> Ken Cronin, UKOOG chief executive said to the <a href="http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/general-news/industry-claims-shale-gas-could-create-thousands-of-jobs-1-6576670" target="_blank">Yorkshire Post</a>. <br><br> Activists have attacked the report, branding it “rose-tinted” and unashamedly in favor of the fracking industry. <br><br><em>"This report is a rehash of rose-tinted industry guesstimates about the economic potential of fracking in the UK,"</em> said Dr. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace. <em>"Paying accountants to tally up hypothetical jobs won't change the fact that executives still have no idea whether they'll actually be able to get gas out of the ground on a commercial scale in the UK.”</em> <br><br> Like many opponents of the controversial shale gas extraction technique, Parr wants the government to redirect more resources to developing renewable energy technology. <br><br> The practice of fracking has received a widely negative reputation elsewhere in the world. The US has seen mass demonstrations by victims of its chemical fallout, accompanied by studies showing spikes in hereditary conditions found in newborn children of families living anywhere near a fracking well. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154460-us-overcrowded-prisons-clemency/</guid><title><![CDATA[Jail-breaking point: Overcrowded prisons strike White House clemency chord]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154460-us-overcrowded-prisons-clemency/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b5/c0/00/us-overcrowded-prisons-clemency.jpg" title="Chino State Prison (AFP Photo / Kevork Djansezian)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 13:02:35 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b5/c0/00/us-overcrowded-prisons-clemency.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The enormous outlay for overcrowded US federal prisons is forcing the White House to consider clemency and entreat non-violent, low-level felons serving terms for drug-related crimes to apply for early release.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b5/c0/00/us-overcrowded-prisons-clemency.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Chino State Prison (AFP Photo / Kevork Djansezian)" /> <p> Next week the US Bureau of Prisons will make the inmates aware of the six criteria elaborated by the US Justice Department for those who deserve early parole. </p><p> Those who want to go at large should conform to the following criteria: have a clean prison record, have no history of violence, possess no significant connections to gangs or other criminal organizations, and have at least 10 years served in prison. </p><p> First and foremost the amnesty is being prepared to repair injustice for those who would have received considerably shorter prison terms if they were put on trial today. </p><p> <em>“These older, stringent punishments that are out of line with sentences imposed under today's laws erode people's confidence in our criminal justice system,”</em> Deputy Attorney General James Cole told AP. </p><p> The matter is that back in 2010 the Fair Sentencing Act eliminated a five-year mandatory minimum for those accused of first-time possession of crack cocaine, a legal loophole that made excessive sentencing in drug cases possible for many years. But the FSA law had no retroactive effect, leaving about 9,000 low-level felons behind bars who were sentenced before 2010 for drug-related crimes. </p><p> Harsh penalties for drug offenders is an echo of the legal battle to constrain cocaine epidemic in 1980s, which resulted in disproportionately tough punishment for drug offenders. </p><p> Another peculiarity in the cocaine issue was that crack cocaine drug abusers were primarily black US citizens, whereas those who consumed the drug in powder form, had tendency to be mostly white. The crack smokers were usually convicted to longer prison terms. </p><p> <em>“These defendants were properly held accountable for their criminal conduct,”</em> Cole acknowledged, <em>“However, some of them, simply because of the operation of sentencing laws on the books at the time, received substantial sentences that are disproportionate to what they would receive today.”</em> </p><p> The new clemency criteria would be applied to inmates of solely federal prisons. A source cited by Cole estimated the number of such inmates as approximately 23,000. </p><p> </p><p> Yet the situation in US state prisons is no good either, as the capacity of correctional institutions has been long since exceeded to a disastrous level. </p><p> For example, prisons in Nebraska are running at 155 percent of capacity as of the end of March 2014. </p><p> Prisons are also overpopulated in California, where courts have already ruled the authorities to reduce the number of prisoners to 137.5 percent of the originally intended capacity, but only by February 2016, when the state is obliged to have no more than 112,164 inmates in 34 correctional facilities. </p><p> Given the overwhelming excess of prisoners in the US federal penitentiaries, there is little wonder that the Justice Department's budget is bulging at the seams, as billions are spent on confinement of those who offended the law, even though many of them could only do wrong to themselves by drug abuse. </p><p> The Justice Department's <a href="http://rt.com/usa/prison-population-grows-thirty-963/" target="_blank">allocation</a> for the federal prison system increased from $5 billion in 2008 to $6.9 billion today. Of that total, $2.5 billion is meant for inmate programs such as drug treatment, ‘psychology services’, and $435 million for food services. </p><p> In a report last year the US inspector general warned of a “growing crisis” over prison expenditures that threatens other law enforcement priorities. </p><p> Activists from such organizations as Families Against Mandatory Minimums and the Sentencing Project believe that despite the narrowness of the new clemency criteria, it could help focus the attention of Congress on expanding legislation to cut short mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug-related crimes. </p><p> <em>“It seems the Justice Department is doing what it can to help stem the tide of people going to prison in record numbers for absurd lengths of time,”</em> told AP Julie Stewart, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. <em>“It really is up to Congress to take the next step and change the number of mandatory sentencing laws,”</em> she said. </p><h2> Prisonland </h2><p> The number of the prisoners in America sums up to a quarter of the world’s total, AP reports. </p><p> Starting from the late 1970s, the US prison population has been growing along with government spending. Today about one in 100 of Americans is serving time. </p><p> The number of Americans incarcerated in federal prisons throughout the country has <a href="http://rt.com/usa/prison-population-grows-thirty-963/" target="_blank">increased</a> by nearly 30 percent over the past 10 years, according to a new report by an investigative arm of Congress. </p><p> The US federal custody currently incarcerates about 216,000 inmates, at least half of whom ended up in prison for drug-related crimes. </p><p> </p><p> These statistics also extend beyond drugs and offenders: one in 28 children in America has a parent serving time for drug trafficking. </p><p> That explains why the US Attorney General Eric Holder is <a href="http://rt.com/usa/drugs-prison-sentencing-holder-550/" target="_blank">advocating</a> shorter prison sentences for less serious drug trafficking offenses. This could dramatically cut US federal prison spending and herald the beginning of a new justice system. </p><p> Today <a href="http://rt.com/usa/50-black-40-white-arrested-297/" target="_blank">nearly half</a> of the African-American men who grow up in the United States are arrested at least once by the time they hit their 23rd birthday, according to a new landmark study that set out to examine biases within the criminal justice system. </p><p> According to the <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-prison-industry-in-the-united-states-big-business-or-a-new-form-of-slavery/8289" target="_blank">latest reports</a> from Global Research, the Center for Research on Globalization, there are approximately 2 million inmates in state, federal and private prisons throughout the US, most of the inmates are Black and Hispanic. </p><p> Many of the incarcerated are forced to work for various American industries “for a pittance.” They are paid some 25 cents an hour under threat of being locked in isolation cells. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/154564-problems-with-elections-in-afghanistan/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Transparency is hardly only problem of Afghan elections’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/154564-problems-with-elections-in-afghanistan/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/bc/40/00/problems-with-elections-in-afghanistan.jpg" title="Election officials hold a ballot paper during the vote counting process at a polling station in Herat Province, April 5, 2014 (Reuters / Omar Sobhani)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 12:55:48 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/bc/40/00/problems-with-elections-in-afghanistan.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Many things are required to rebuild Afghanistan after so many decades of war and it is far more than any election is going to be able to put into power, Phyllis Bennis, director at the Institute for Policy Studies, told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/bc/40/00/problems-with-elections-in-afghanistan.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Election officials hold a ballot paper during the vote counting process at a polling station in Herat Province, April 5, 2014 (Reuters / Omar Sobhani)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The Afghans are taking several weeks just to count all the votes. Will such a lengthy process ensure more transparency?</em> </p><p> <strong>Phyllis Bennis:</strong> I don’t think transparency is the biggest problem. There is a huge problem of the nature of the election in the country that is still at war. This is a situation where you have thousands upon thousands of paper ballots that need to be transported across a very contested territory. It is going to take a very long time and transparency is hardly the only problem. There is a big question whether any election in this context of war can be considered free and fair. There were many incidents of violence on the day of the election, but even aside from that the question who was able to run, who was able to campaign, who was able to get to the voting booths and who was not remains a huge problem in Afghanistan. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What are the potential risks for the country if no candidate secures at least 50 percent of the vote and a runoff has to take place?</em> </p><p> <strong>PB:</strong> I think everyone is anticipating that there will not be 50 percent for any candidate. The two most likely candidates, Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, together make up only about 70 percent of the total votes, so it’s almost certain that there will be a runoff. The reality is that for most Afghans, whoever gets elected it’s not going to change their situation very much. </p><p> The level of violence is going to continue, the fact that Afghanistan remains the worst country in the world in terms of child mortality, for instance, is not likely to change, and both of the top candidates have made a decision ahead of time that they would be willing to sign on to an agreement with the US to keep the US and NATO troops in the country long after the end of this year. That means that they are going to have to deal with question of immunity what ended the presence of US troops in Iraq when the Iraqi Parliament refused to agree to what the president wanted, which was an agreement to give immunity to the US soldiers. Whether the Afghan government is prepared to do that, we don’t know yet. But that’s one thing that could result in a full withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The vote's already been hailed as a success by Western observers but is such optimism really justified?</em> </p><p> <strong>PB:</strong> I think the vote was a success in the sense that many people went to the polls and they voted. So in that sense the form of democracy was carried out. We don’t know yet, we haven’t had the first or the second result yet from the two different committees that have to vet the results for the issues of fraud, vote tempering etc., we haven’t heard that yet. But even if that happens, I think that we have the form but it would be a far-stretched to say that we have the substance of democracy in Afghanistan. This is the country that does not, unlike Iraq, have a long history of a strong central government. For many years President Karzai was known as <em>‘a major of Kabul’</em> because his influence is really only extended as far as the borders of the city. So what it is going to take to rebuild Afghanistan after so many decades of war is far more than any election is going to be able to put into power. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Kabul has still not secured a security pact with Washington that would see thousands of American troops remain after the NATO pullout. Is there a chance this pact won't materialize at all?</em> </p><p> <strong>PB:</strong> Right now it looks like it will happen because both of the leading candidates have said they would sign it. The big question is that nobody has been talking about very publicly is whether this agreement will include the guarantee of immunity for all the US troops and war crimes they might commit. </p><p> </p><p> We know from President Obama that his intention in keeping something between 10,000 and 20,000 US troops in Afghanistan after 2014, is that they will not be involved in country insurgency, winning hearts and minds, helping to rebuild the country. They will be there to kill bad guys that means to kill Afghans, people who the US says, somebody told them, is a bad guy. Now whether that leads to the killing of civilians in large numbers as it has for so many years, we can only assume that it will. And if that’s the case whether the Afghan government is prepared to allow those responsible right up the chain of command and including the soldiers on the ground to be immune from being held accountable in Afghanistan’s own judicial system, that’s the big question. That’s what we don’t know yet. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Would Afghan security forces be able to contain the Taliban without foreign assistance? And even with a few thousand American troops helping out would that be enough to hold back the insurgency?</em> </p><p> <strong>PB:</strong> I don’t think we’ve seen a situation even when there were 150,000 US troops in the country. We have not seen a situation where the Afghan military and police were able to ‘keep the Taliban at bay’. This is the situation where the Afghan military is essentially one more militia, it is one that's the biggest and the one backed and armed by the US. But at the end of the day it’s a sectarian based militia accountable to the government that does not have very much support in the country. So that’s going to be a huge problem whether or not there is a small number of the US troops there. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>After 12 years of foreign support and billions of dollars in aid, Afghanistan is still one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Will the new president be able to change anything?</em> </p><p> <strong>PB:</strong> This is one of the big questions. Certainly the president has a certain amount of influence within his own cabinet, within his own government, but the culture of corruption in this government is very strong and the notion of the election of one more president is going to somehow change that would be very optimistic. </p><p> What we saw with President Karzai, there were not very strong allegations of his involvement personally in corruption, but he certainly surrounded himself with people who tolerated huge levels of corruption in every component of the government. I don’t really see the power of a new president being able to change that any time soon. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why is the drug business in Afghanistan so developed? Will it possible to resolve this problem with a new president in power?</em> </p><p> <strong>PB:</strong> I think for the same reason the drug businesses flourish in other parts of the world. For many people this is the only way they can make a living, for many people growing poppies it is the only realistic crop they can grow. They have no access to the roads, to transport. Pulling in a pound for some kind of opium is a lot easier to transport than the tons of wheat that you have to grow to make the same amount of money. So all of the questions about undeveloped character of Afghan infrastructure, its poverty, all of those that feed the drug production and the drug trade. Until that changes, I don’t think that any new laws that might be passed are likely to have much impact in the outlying areas of the country where the vast majorities of Afghans live. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154588-russia-drill-ukraine-operation/</guid><title><![CDATA[Russia 'forced' to launch military drills near border in response to Ukraine op - Moscow]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154588-russia-drill-ukraine-operation/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bd/c0/00/russia-drill-ukraine-operation-.jpg" title="Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu (Reuters / Michael Klimentyev)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 12:53:24 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/bd/c0/00/russia-drill-ukraine-operation-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Russia has begun extensive military exercises near the Ukrainian border following the escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bd/c0/00/russia-drill-ukraine-operation-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu (Reuters / Michael Klimentyev)" /> <p> <em>“The order to use force against civilians has already been given, and if this military machine is not stopped, the amount of casualties will only grow,”</em> Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said during an official meeting in Moscow. </p><p> <em>“War games by NATO in Poland and the Baltic states are also not helping the normalization of the situation.

Yemeni officials claim that the target site, located in remote mountainous regions in the country’s troubled south, was one of the few examples of permanent infrastructure setup by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to train fighters and store armaments. </p><p> The strike allegedly took place with regional cooperation and assistance from Saudi Arabia, and due to official secrecy provisions, the United States does not have a legal obligation to acknowledge or comment on the strikes undertaken by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). </p><p> The exact death toll varies from source to source, but more than a dozen people have been killed at minimum, with at least three civilian causalities. Witnesses say that a car carrying the alleged militants was hit with a missile as it drove by a vehicle carrying civilians, who were also killed. A second strike on the area was launched shortly after. </p><p> Yemen’s government officially claims that 55 alleged militants have been killed so far, and the Supreme Security Committee - which includes the country’s intelligence chief, defense and interior ministers - and President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi approved the strike. </p><p> Hadi, who came to power in February 2012 after he stood unopposed in elections, is a staunch supporter of the US drone program, despite the high number of civilian casualties incurred by the strikes. AQAP, active in the south-central regions of the country, is a small but pervasive organization whose tactics include using sophisticated car bombs and suicide attacks that have been bold and deadly in their fight against the government in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa. </p><p> </p><h2> Criminalizing drones </h2><p> Yemen, the only state on the Arabian Peninsula to have a purely republican form of government, is in the midst of an ongoing political and security crisis prompted by divisions between various movements and factions, who are themselves divided between Sunni and Shiite sects of Islam. The central government in Sanaa commands little authority outside the capital, and faces a widely popular secessionist movement in the south, an entrenched Shiite rebel movement in the north, and a scattered AQAP insurgency campaign that has succeeded in gathering adherents largely due to their resentment of the Obama administration’s drone warfare campaign throughout the country. </p><p> Yemen has the youngest population in the world, with an <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2013/04/02/world-bank-grant-supports-employment-creation-yemens-neediest-youth-women" target="_blank">unemployment rate</a> as high as 40 percent, while half the population still lives below the poverty line. </p><p> Longtime leader Ali Abdullah Saleh submitted his resignation in 2011, following nationwide protests calling for an end to corruption and greater representation. The collective vision for reform shared by nearly all sides of this highly polarized country failed to progress following Saleh’s removal, and like other Arab nations who experienced a change in power during the period known as the Arab Spring, militias and extremist elements took advantage of the precarious security situation to embolden themselves. </p><p> In an effort to reconstruct Yemeni society and assuage various movements and communities who feel unrepresented throughout the country, Hadi has channeled his administration’s efforts into UN-backed reconciliation talks known as the National Dialogue Conference (NDC), which impressively brought together over 500 activists and representatives from a diverse array of backgrounds to reform the security apparatus and administrative structure of the country, and draft a new constitution that would be the basis for both presidential and parliamentary elections in 2014. </p><p> In a rare show of consensus, participants at the conference voted to criminalize the use of drones for extrajudicial killing, which have enraged average Yemenis from all walks of life. Drone strikes were made technically <a href="http://islamicpostonline.com/article/yemeni_conference_declares_drone_strikes_illegal-596" target="_blank">illegal</a> since 2013, but their continued prevalence in partnership with Yemeni security forces dangerously delegitimizes the government in Sanaa and puts Hadi in an exceedingly awkward position at a time when the government is distrusted for colluding with foreign powers. </p><p> The message sent by the delegates of the NDC, which is the most democratic and representative reflection of Yemeni society that currently exists, is that the use of drones are an affront to the sovereignty and dignity of the state, opening the possibility that President Hadi may be criminally persecuted if the current policy continues. </p><p> </p><h2> Killing with impunity </h2><p> President Obama’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/us/politics/transcript-of-obamas-speech-on-drone-policy.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">speech</a> on his administration’s drone warfare program in 2013 was widely perceived as a convincing and compelling defense of an otherwise controversial policy. </p><p> In describing the elaborate precautions and high standards taken prior to launching a strike, Obama claimed, <em>“there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured.”</em> The president acknowledged how any US military activity risks creating animosity and enemies in the target country, and spoke of the high threshold set for taking lethal action, in respect for the dignity of every human life. </p><p> According to the rules in place under the Obama administration, targeted strikes can only take place when capturing a suspect would not be feasible, when the authorities of the country in question could not or would not address the threat, and when no other reasonable alternatives were available. </p><p> In the six months since Obama delivered his speech on the rules for using armed drones, <a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2013/11/26/new-analysis-questions-constraint-on-us-drone-strikes/" target="_blank">reports</a> indicate that covert strikes in Yemen and Pakistan incurred more casualties when compared to the six months before the speech was given. </p><p> Behind the US president’s carefully-selected language and various moral assurances, is a covert assassination program that has operated under an accountability and transparency vacuum, where basic statistical data is withheld under the blanketing justification of protecting national security, and hundreds of innocent civilians have been targeted and killed with near-total impunity. </p><p> The facts that have been established about the Obama administration’s program are profoundly disturbing. The United States is bound to abide by international human rights law outside of a defined conflict zone, which would apply for its operations in Yemen and Pakistan, where war has not been declared. In such a legal environment, targeted killings can only take place when strictly unavoidable and necessary to protect life, and due to the official secrecy policies surrounding the Obama administration’s drone program, US officials are not legally obliged to acknowledge strikes or provide evidence needed to substantiate alleged threats to the degree that would satisfy the law enforcement standards that govern the intentional use of lethal force outside armed conflict. </p><p> The legal criterion to justify a strike is determined in secret by the White House with advice from the Justice Department, but with no oversight or accountability. Obama’s so-called <em>‘near-certainty’</em> standard and his administration’s definition of an <em>‘imminent threat’</em> are not open to independent review, and are taken unilaterally by the executive branch. As <a href="http://rt.com/news/un-drones-report-afghanistan-us-366/" target="_blank">noted</a> by UN Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson, the United States violates international law by targeting of persons directly participating in hostilities who are located in non-belligerent states. </p><p> The known criteria for justifying lethal force has proven to be shockingly indiscriminate, to the point where the president’s ‘near-certainty’ standards can never logically be met. The Obama administration, according to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/05/obama-administration-drone-strikes-war-crimes" target="_blank">investigations</a>, targets individuals based on their exhibiting of ‘behavioral characteristics’ that are deemed typical of militants, rather than making strikes based on the confirmed identity of a target. </p><p> Such use of <em>‘signature strikes’</em> has resulted in the arbitrary targeting of any military-age male in a given strike vicinity on the presumption that he is a combatant, and directly targetable. The <em>‘double tap’</em> technique involves launching an initial drone strike, which is followed by a second strike that targets rescuers and first responders, a tactic that Al-Qaeda and other terrorist outfits have made use of in the past. </p><p> The double tap relies on the assumption that the initial target is a militant, and all those who converge on the scene of the initial strike must be militants themselves. Such a strategy cannot possibly meet the stringent requirements needed to avoid the killing of civilians, and can only result in actions that can be described as war crimes or extrajudicial killings. </p><p> </p><h2> An undeclared war </h2><p> Obama’s speech marked the first formal public acknowledgement of a US citizen’s death in a drone strike. Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric of Yemeni descent and a US citizen, was killed by a drone strike in Yemen in May 2011. In describing his criteria for an extrajudicial targeted strike, Obama claims there is no difference between a foreign terrorist and a terrorist with US citizenship. </p><p> Al-Awlaki’s assassination and the subsequent killing of his 16-year-old son, also an American national, sets an alarming precedent. At one time, Anwar al-Awlaki was known to be a moderate cleric who denounced terrorism and violence. At some stage between the events of 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Anwar al-Awlaki underwent a profound change in his political orientation and began to preach jihad, in response to what he viewed as the United States engaging in a war against Islam and Muslim civilians. </p><p> Just as Anwar al-Awlaki’s views morphed toward the violent fringe as a reaction to US policy, the radicalization of communities and traumatized survivors of drone strikes throughout Yemen provides AQAP with a steady flow of militants seeking to avenge their families' deaths by harming the United States. The Obama administration and the Yemeni political elite may view drone strikes as a short-term fix, but the radicalization of growing swathes of society will prove to be a major liability for any future government in power. </p><p> Washington has assured the public that the American role in Yemen is highly constrained, and held in accordance with a mandate to target members of Al-Qaeda approved by Congress after 9/11. The scope and breadth of covert operations undertaken by the CIA and secretive paramilitary unit Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) are impossible to ascertain, but Washington’s role in Yemen’s civil wars are much deeper than what the public imagines. </p><p> The inhumanity of this war comes to the fore in incidents such as the US bombing of a wedding convoy in December 2013, killing 12 civilians. Consider the vile injustice meted out in 2009 to the people of al-Majalah, a Bedouin village that became the target of US cluster-bombing, killing 41 civilians, including nine women and 21 children.

Back in 1936 Chinese shipping company Chung Wei Steamship Co leased two ships to a Japanese company, a predecessor of Mitsui OSK Lines. The Imperial Japanese Navy used these vessels until the lease agreements on the ships were broken in 1937 due to war between Japan and China. </p><p> The ships came to grief during the war. In 1938, one ship hit a reef and sank while the other was destroyed by a mine in 1944. </p><p> In 1988 Chinese firms controlled by Chen Zhen and Chen Chun, two grandchildren of Chung Wei's owner, sued the Japanese company (later called Mitsui) for the loss of the two vessels. The companies were seeking wartime reparations of $160 million. </p><p> In 2007 China’s maritime court ruled that the Japanese company owed compensation of 2.9 billion Japanese yen ($28.5 mln) to the Chinese firm. In 2010 Shanghai Municipal Higher People's Court made a final verdict, defending the 2007 judgment. </p><p> China-Japan relations have been recently aggravated by a row over the group of tiny islets in the East China Sea, known as Diaoyu in China and as Senkaku in Japan. The two countries have symbolically signaled their defense readiness by scrambling planes over 400 times in the past 12 months. Tensions over what are believed to be resource-rich territories soared again on mid-April after Japan started work on a new radar station close to the islands. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/154540-israel-needs-divided-palestinians/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Israel needs divided and weakened Palestinians’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/154540-israel-needs-divided-palestinians/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ba/c0/00/israel-needs-divided-palestinians.jpg" title="Palestinians hold national flags as they celebrate after an announcement of a reconciliation agreement in Gaza City April 23, 2014 (Reuters / Ibraheem Abu Mustafa)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 10:03:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ba/c0/00/israel-needs-divided-palestinians.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Israeli government is very disturbed by Palestinian unity and seeking to use the peace process to divide them again so as to continue the land grabs, James Petras, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Binghamton University, told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ba/c0/00/israel-needs-divided-palestinians.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Palestinians hold national flags as they celebrate after an announcement of a reconciliation agreement in Gaza City April 23, 2014 (Reuters / Ibraheem Abu Mustafa)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The Israeli Prime Minister has condemned the Palestinian reconciliation deal, saying that Fatah has to choose between peace talks with Israel or peace with Hamas. Do you think a resolution is possible?</em> </p><p> <strong>James Petras:</strong> Netanyahu’s statement is farcical because Israel has played off Hamas against the leadership in the West Bank and through <em>“divide and conquer”</em> has expanded its settlements in the West Bank. The unity of Gaza and the West Bank government will strengthen any peace process by giving the Palestinians greater leverage. The fact of the matter is that up to now Netanyahu has made no positive moves to cease the settlements, the land grabs and to stop the military incursions into the West Bank and Gaza. The move by the Palestinians is certainly a very positive move, it lessens tension within the Palestinian community, and I think the Israeli government is very disturbed by this unity and is seeking to use the so-called peace process to divide them once again, weaken interlocutors on the West Bank and continue the land grabs. The peace process according to Netanyahu is essentially to negotiate with the divided and weaken Palestinians in order to continue its ethnic cleansing in the West Bank. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Israel reportedly carried out an air strike on Gaza soon after the deal was announced. Can we expect tensions to escalate in the region because of the deal?</em> </p><p> <strong>JP:</strong> The deal isn’t a source of the tensions. The tensions are precisely because Israel has not respected the frontiers and the territories in which the Palestinians govern. These arbitrary violent incursions by Israel are really creating the tension and certainly the rejection of Israel of a joint negotiating team of the Palestinians is likely to precipitate greater conflict. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The US State Department has called the deal “disappointing.” But why would the US and Israel oppose what Palestinian people see as a reconciliation and a matter of internal affairs?</em> </p><p> <strong>JP:</strong> Unfortunately the US has not been acting as an honest broker. From the very beginning of the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel, the US has been very much engaged with the Israelis, supplying them with $3 billion, essentially and military aid and providing them with diplomatic coverage for all of their human rights offenses. The fact that the Palestinians are united and the fact that the Palestinians will go with the common agenda will strengthen their position in negotiations. Washington’s partisanship with Israel will be ineffective in this light, it will not be able to buy off Abbas and turn him against the leadership in Gaza. I think Washington has lost a client in the Palestinian movement and that they will be moaning this and also commiserating with the Israelis on the fact that they do not have a complacent interlocutor. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Hamas and Fatah have brokered similar deals in the past, but failed to keep them. What are the chances this time they will implement the agreements?</em> </p><p> <strong>JP:</strong> There are no guarantees; they have been falling out in the past. It seems to me that the fact that Abbas hasn’t been able to secure any concessions and support from Washington and the Israelis continued to swallow up land in the West Bank, he’s finally recognized that cuddling up to Israel was not going to get him anywhere. The logical turn to the unity with leadership in Gaza is a result of the failure of his efforts to conciliate the Israeli sacrifice the Palestinians in Gaza. The policy of conciliation has not worked and the reconciliation with the Palestinian community throughout the region is the next logical step. </p><p> The US policy towards Israel is very biased. It is largely influenced through the pro-Israel lobby in the US which can command three-quarters of the [members of] Congress and has significant direct representation in the executive branch. This has prejudiced the US role as an honest broker in these negotiations. So I’m not surprised that Washington is disappointed because their Israeli ally is not in such a strong position as it has been. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Do you believe that the deal actually puts the two-state solution off even further?</em> </p><p> <strong>JP:</strong> Israel has never believed that there is a two-state or one-state solution. They believe in one Jewish state and the marginalization of whoever doesn’t qualify as an Israeli Jew. It’s a policy of ethnic cleansing, it’s a question of dispossession of the Palestinians. I think the facts on the ground speak for themselves. Whatever the Israelis say, the fact of the matter is that they have not ceased to seize Palestinian land in the West Bank particularly since 1969, over the past year over 20,000 Israeli settlers have seized more Palestinian land and projections are for another 10,000 in the coming month. The fact of the matter is that it’s a question of survival today for the Palestinians, whether they will have any land to work with and to form a new state. The Israelis are in a big push and the formation of the government in Israel – Naftali Bennett, Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu – represents the most extreme right-wing government in the history of Israel and their intention is not to co-exist with the Palestinians but to expel them completely out of what they call Greater Israel. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/154536-palestinian-unity-excuse-for-israel/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Palestinian unity govt plays into Israeli hands’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/154536-palestinian-unity-excuse-for-israel/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ba/80/00/palestinian-unity-excuse-for-israel.jpg" title="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (AFP Photo / Abir Sultan)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 09:24:46 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ba/80/00/palestinian-unity-excuse-for-israel.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The unity government with Hamas known for its hostile stance on Israel is a chance for Israelis to say that the Palestinians, not them, are to blame on the stalemate in the peace process, Israeli human rights advocate Uri Zaki told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ba/80/00/palestinian-unity-excuse-for-israel.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (AFP Photo / Abir Sultan)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Fatah and Hamas have started process of reconciliation, while Israel reacted on that by calling off the US-backed peace talks. Why there has been such a strong reaction from Israel?</em> </p><p> <strong>Uri Zaki:</strong> For Israel it’s very convenient to portray this Palestinian unity government as a threat to peace. In fact, the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, I think, in the back room opened a bottle of champagne. This government is not truly interested in promoting peace process and therefore, while they have such a unity government with Hamas, which is of course an organization that uses terror measures against Israel, for them it’s a victory to prove that they are not the ones to blame on the stalemate in the peace process but rather the Palestinians. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Soon after the deal, Israel reportedly carried out an attack on Gaza. Will the military conflict escalate?</em> </p><p> <strong>UZ:</strong> This unity government was the last resort of Abbas understanding that he doesn’t have really an Israeli partner at the moment. In immediate run this is bad news for the peace process, but as I said before, I’m not sure that this peace process actually leads somewhere. In the long run, though, the inclusion of Hamas and the reunion between the two parts of the pre-1967 Palestine, meaning the West Bank and Gaza, is good news for those who actually want peace. </p><p> The fact that so far Abbas has been negotiating only representing the West Bank was a weakness for him, to strike a peace deal with only the West Bank is not enough for true Palestinian-Israeli peace accord. If you really want a peace accord with the Palestinians Abbas has to be the leader also of the Gaza Strip. Over a million Palestinians are living there out of 3.5 million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza. This is very important in the long run to have the Palestinian unity in the peace process with Israel. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The US has called the agreement ‘disappointing’. Why do the US and Israel oppose the reconciliation which is an internal matter for the Palestinians?</em> </p><p> <strong>UZ:</strong> The Hamas movement is not shy and sometimes uses terrorist measures against Israel. We know that Hamas-led Gaza was a launching base for the rockets falling all the way to Tel Aviv. Of course, the Hamas so far has not accepted Israel’s right to exist, would not recognize the Oslo accords and would not negotiate with Israel. And it has been the traditional point of view of both the US and Israel that the Hamas as long as it doesn’t take those measures cannot be a partner. </p><p> Again, in an immediate run I can understand this reaction, but in the longer run it’s very important for Abbas to include Gaza which is led by Hamas. By the way, Hamas’s strength comes from the weakness in the negotiations. As long as the moderate side led by Mahmoud Abbas cannot prove that the negotiations with Israel lead to actual peace to Palestinian state, then the Hamas gets stronger. That’s what we see right now. If there is progress in the peace process, the Hamas stand will go lower and Abbas will be in a better situation representing the Gaza Strip as well. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/154496-russia-surrogacy-single-bill/</guid><title><![CDATA[Draft Russian law restricts surrogacy for single people]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/154496-russia-surrogacy-single-bill/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b8/00/00/russia-surrogacy-single-bill.jpg" title="RIA Novosti / Igor Zarembo"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 09:19:24 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b8/00/00/russia-surrogacy-single-bill.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Russian MPs have prepared a new bill on surrogacy that includes a ban on hired surrogate mothers, a mandatory agreement from a special medical commission and a restriction of its use by single people.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b8/00/00/russia-surrogacy-single-bill.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="RIA Novosti / Igor Zarembo" /> <p> The head of the State Duma Committee for Women and Family, Elena Mizulina, said in an interview with Izvestia newspaper that there were no plans to ban surrogacy, but more state control was needed in this sphere due to the large number of problems it causes. </p><p> For example, there are numerous cases when a child born from surrogacy is later refused both by the genetic parents and by the surrogate mother, Mizulina noted. This makes the child an orphan without even a name, she added. </p><p> “<em>Surrogate mothers have practically no rights in the current Russian reality. Their health is not protected legally, pregnancy leave is still an open question and it is not even clear who should be taking it – the surrogate mother or the biological one</em>,” Izvestia quoted the lawmaker as saying. </p><p> To change the situation for the better, Mizulina’s committee has prepared a draft law and offered it for broad public discussion on Thursday. The main objective of the document is introducing legal limits of the method and allowing its use in extraordinary situations by infertile couples. </p><p> In particular, the new bill limits the use of surrogacy by single men and women. As same-sex marriage is not legal in Russia, this would practically mean a ban on surrogacy for gay couples as well. The draft also suggests only allowing surrogacy procedures in state medical institutions and setting up special boards with such institutions in which medics, social care workers and representatives of religious organizations would give their approval for operations after studying each particular case. </p><p> While defending her point, Mizulina noted that surrogacy is currently banned in many countries, including France and Germany and even more nations, like UK had outlawed commercial surrogacy. Most countries in the world only allow its use to married couples, she added. A number of countries, like the Netherlands have legislative bans on advertising and promotion of surrogacy services, the MP said. </p><p> Mizulina represents the center-left Fair Russia party and promotes religious ethics and ideals in the parliament. Last year she suggested in a public speech that surrogacy and abortions are a major threat, not only to Russia, but to humanity as a whole, and are leading to its extinction. </p><p> This is close to the position of Russian Orthodox Church. In October last year, a top Orthodox cleric blasted surrogacy as “<em>mutiny against God</em>” and “<em>happy fascism</em>,” and said that the Church would press for a complete legislative ban. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154544-slavyansk-fighting-east-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Kiev military op: Ukrainian army tanks, APCs, troops attack Slavyansk]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154544-slavyansk-fighting-east-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bb/00/00/1slavyansk-fighting-east-ukraine.jpg" title="Ukrainian special forces take position in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk on April 24, 2014 (AFP Photo / Kirill Kudryavtsev)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 09:05:28 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://img.rt.com/files/news/25/bb/00/00/1slavyansk-fighting-east-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Five anti-government protesters have reportedly been killed and one injured in the eastern Ukrainian town of Slavyansk after Kiev authorities sent tanks and armored vehicles against the local population.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/bb/00/00/1slavyansk-fighting-east-ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Ukrainian special forces take position in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk on April 24, 2014 (AFP Photo / Kirill Kudryavtsev)" /> <p> <a href="http://rt.com/news/eastern-ukraine-army-operation-680/">Follow RT’s LIVE UPDATES on military operation in eastern Ukraine</a> </p><p> <em>“During the antiterrorist operation, three checkpoints erected by illegal military groups have been destroyed in the northeastern part of Slavyansk,”</em> the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said, adding: <em>"At least five terrorists have been killed.

Morales said that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was blameless in the recent wave of unrest in the country and accused Washington of orchestrating a civil war. <br><br><em>“I believe [the US] are trying to incite if not a coup d’état then a civil war from their empire,”</em> Morales said. <em>“They are always going to sponsor internal conflict so that they can interfere and invade us to take control of our oil reserves.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> The world needs an <em>“anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist and anti-colonial youth,”</em> said Morales, urging Latin Americans to stand together in solidarity with Venezuela. Morales said there was no danger of a coup d’état in Bolivia since the government had ejected US Ambassador Phillip Golberg in 2008 after he was accused of collaborating in a plot to overthrow the government. <br><br> Venezuela has been gripped by a wave of anti-government protests since February which has left at least 41 dead and over 600 injured. The Venezuelan government has recognized people’s right to demonstrate, but has accused foreign-backed, right-wing extremists of hijacking the protests in an attempt to oust Maduro. <br><br> At present, the Maduro government is in dialogue with some of the members of the opposition movement to try and find a peaceful solution to the conflict. The opponents of the government complain that Venezuela is experiencing massive inflation and shortages of basic food products, as well as frequent power cuts. </p><p> </p><h2> ‘Economic war’ </h2><p> Maduro announced last week that Venezuela was facing an <em>“economic war”</em> and as such his government intended to fight back with a new “offensive” to combat capitalism. He set out the main aims of the new initiative on Monday, including the encouragement of supply and production and the stabilization of prices in Venezuela. <br><br><em>“This new economic offensive should bring prosperity to the people and the country. Neoliberalism speaks of growth, but growth for whom? For those that always had wealth, not the have-nots,”</em> Maduro said. <br><br> Maduro has previously blamed the strife in Venezuela on Washington, saying that the US is orchestrating the unrest with a view to overthrowing his government. In March, Caracas’s foreign minister, Elias Jaua, accused US Secretary of State John Kerry of inciting murder and violence in Venezuela. Washington has denied any links to the ongoing unrest and maintains the Venezuelan government is terrorizing its own people. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154472-gunmen-slavyansk-attack-defense/</guid><title><![CDATA[Gunmen attack self-defense forces in eastern Ukraine]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154472-gunmen-slavyansk-attack-defense/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b6/80/00/gunmen-slavyansk-attack-defense-.jpg" title="Ukrainian security force officers walk past a checkpoint set on fire and left by anti-goverment protesters near Slavyansk April 24, 2014 (AFP Photo / Gleb Garanich)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 06:36:56 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b6/80/00/gunmen-slavyansk-attack-defense-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Unknown gunmen have attacked a checkpoint near Slavyansk in eastern Ukraine.

The purpose is to prevent the spread of the Kremlin infection,”</em> Ukrainian presidential candidate and Right Sector leader Dmitry Yarosh announced at a press conference in Dnepropetrovsk. </p><p> He says the vital industrial city in Ukraine, Dnepropetrovsk provides a better platform to observe the situation in Donbass where pro-federalization protests are flourishing, after the coup in Kiev. </p><p> Yarosh, placed by Russia on an international most wanted terrorist list, also announced that he started forming a special squad of fighters called “Donbass.” </p><p> <em>“We coordinate all of our actions with the leadership of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Security service of Ukraine,”</em> Yarosh said. </p><p> Local media reports that the unit will comprise about 800 fighters.

He sees the existence and the expansion of the neo-Nazi group as a violation of last week's Geneva accords. </p><p> <em>“In Geneva we agreed that there must be total rejection of extremists and the Right Sector is still very active, and after Geneva the Right Sector staged provocations killing several people in the vicinity of Slavyansk during Easter Sunday.

Yarosh believes that Russia is Ukraine’s <em>“eternal foe”</em> and that a war between the two countries is <em>“inevitable.”</em> </p><p> The Right Sector was formed in November 2013 soon after the anti-government protests in Ukraine began. Members of the radical movement were very active in the violent events which led to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovich. </p><p> The group has been referred to as the most active, the most radical and the best organized group in the Ukrainian unrest. Many of its violent acts have been well-documented by media and in videos posted on YouTube. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154444-net-neutrality-fcc-providers/</guid><title><![CDATA[​FCC’s new proposal seen as abandoning net neutrality]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154444-net-neutrality-fcc-providers/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b4/c0/00/27.jpg" title="Reuters / Kacper Pempel "/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 03:54:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b4/c0/00/27.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The FCC will propose new rules on Thursday that will offer internet service providers the ability to charge content companies for preferential treatment, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Regardless, advocates of net neutrality have taken issue with that arrangement, which they argue favor larger companies. </p><p> Proponents of net neutrality – the idea that all internet content should be treated equally, thus a maintaining a free and open web – see the proposed FCC rules as an acquiescence to the most powerful internet gatekeepers, such as Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon. </p><p> In its own reporting, the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html?hp" target="_blank">referred</a> to the plan as a <em>”complete turnaround for the FCC”</em> while a spokesperson for Public Knowledge, a Washington DC-based public interest group, said that <em>“the FCC is inviting ISPs to pick winners and losers online.”</em> </p><p> <em>“The proposed rules would mark a complete capitulation to the monied internet interests, harming consumers in the short and long-term,”</em> wrote T.C. Sottek, editor of The Verge, in an <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/23/5644858/dear-fcc-why-do-you-hate-consumers" target="_blank">op-ed</a>. <em>“The ISPs that control the ‘last mile’ of the internet — the pipes that connect to your home — would love nothing more than to extract tolls from companies.”</em> </p><p> Sottek went on to say that the FCC has failed to protect consumer interests by refusing to classify broadband as a public utility, which would insulate customers from inequality or price gouging via new regulations. </p><p> Companies that rely on pristine broadband connections, like phone or video services like Skype, could use the new terms to pay ISPs to maintain heightened service. The companies in this case would be paying for privileges on the “last mile” of broadband networks that connects straight to consumers. The FCC plan does not address “back-end interconnection or peering between content providers and broadband networks,” the Journal reported. </p><p> The FCC will consider the rules internally starting Thursday before a scheduled vote among the five-member commission on May 15. If the rules are passed, they would then be open to public comment. </p><p> In January, a federal court <a href="http://rt.com/usa/fcc-verizon-net-neutrality-596/" target="_blank">threw out</a> previous open internet rules, saying the FCC did not have the power to require internet service providers to treat all traffic equally. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in February he planned to offer new guidelines following the legal pathway provided by the court. </p><p> After the court ruling, open internet advocates criticized the FCC for not previously classifying ISPs as <em>"common carriers"</em> that must operate without preference. They said that the FCC’s fragile legal argument was asking for the court’s rejection. </p><p> <em>"The FCC — under the leadership of former Chairman Julius Genachowski — made a grave mistake when it failed to ground its Open Internet rules on solid legal footing,"</em> said Free Press president Craig Aaron at the time. <em>"Internet users will pay dearly for the previous chairman's lack of political will."</em> </p><p> The Journal reported that the FCC plans to <em>“increase the disclosure requirements for broadband providers,”</em> which could offer more information on different aspects of service along the last mile, such as connection speed. </p><p> The proposal would avoid wireless carriers, though mobile broadband may be subject to the same standards at a later point, the Journal said. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/154456-regional-politics-ukraine-oligarchs/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Kiev envisions regional feuds ruled by oligarchs with private armies’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/154456-regional-politics-ukraine-oligarchs/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/b5/80/00/31.jpg" title="Rinat Akhmetov.(RIA Novosti / Irina Aleksandrova)"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 03:52:35 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/b5/80/00/31.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Kiev's vision of democracy – creating a feudal state with regions under full control of oligarchs using their power over local jobs and salaries to suppress any kind of popular unrest – is backfiring, international relations expert Mark Sleboda told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/b5/80/00/31.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Rinat Akhmetov.(RIA Novosti / Irina Aleksandrova)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The protests in Eastern Ukraine are not dying down – is there a particular sector of society that is driving them or where is this phenomenon coming from?</em> </p><p> <strong>Mark Sleboda:</strong> Up to this point I would say that protests across the east and south Ukraine have been a good cross section of the society. Certainly the most active members have been a number of the ex-Berkut riot police officers, military veterans, particularly from Afghanistan and a number of police. </p><p> But a new phenomenon has emerged that one of the most important working sectors, working class industries of the eastern Ukraine, the miners have begun to participate in protests in increasing numbers. In Donetsk we saw about 200 join the protest many of them quitting their jobs in order to do so. As the oligarchs that the regime in Kiev has imposed to control the area have been threatening to fire their workers if they participate in the rallies. And just most recently, within the last two days the protests have broken out in the city of Krasnodon in the Lugansk region. </p><p> Miners have gone on strike and taken control of the local mining facilities and have started building barricades. And one of their first demands which was since increased was the reinstatement of 30 miners who have been fired for joining nearby rallies in support of this anti-putsch movement. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The eastern part of Ukraine is known as the industrial area, what kind of unique challenges or conflict does it present for authorities in Kiev if the strikes and protests continue?</em> </p><p> <strong>MS:</strong> The majority of Ukraine's exports come from the east Ukraine. In many ways it is the real bread winner of the Ukraine in terms of industry. It has a large metals and mining industry and it also has a large defense sector industry which is intrinsically locked together with the Russian defense sector. In particular this mining industry which is starting to come forth, it employs about 500,000 people throughout the region, it provides about 15 percent of the country's GDP and coal alone is 30 percent of Ukraine's energy consumption. Therefore if this unrest continues and this regime that has taken power in Kiev is not able to control this region, both in terms of economics and in terms of energy, would make it almost impossible for this regime to last very long. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>So shouldn't Kiev do everything it can to keep control and keep order in this very vital region?</em> </p><p> <strong>MS:</strong> Well you would think that they would respond more diplomatically then they have. Their idea of diplomacy so far has been to install the oligarchs throughout the regions to directly control the regions as governors. Kind of like feudal kingdoms and with the assumption which has barren fruit that these oligarchs would fire people who participated in the protest, and also hire their own little private armies of thugs to help to discourage people from participating. And this so far has been their idea of democracy but unfortunately for the regime it seems to be backfiring completely and only seems to be fueling unrest. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Do you think the miners will protest and what do you think will be the government's response?</em> </p><p> <strong>MS:</strong> Like I said, the miners’ participation so far has been slight. These developments in the city of Krasnodon is a major development. And we should watch in the coming days if this miner strike in this one city extends throughout the region of Lugansk and more importantly the neighboring Donbass region, to other mines in the area. </p><p> If that happens than the entire east will be up in arms and we would really be looking at Kiev losing complete control of the area, an increase tension and the threat of a civil war. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Do you think the government will resolve that, or will just a threat of losing the region lead to cool heads prevailing?</em> </p><p> <strong>MS:</strong> I'm all hope that that would be the case, but we have not seen any indication of that. Just within a few hours of vice president Biden's leaving, we saw in Kiev yesterday the acting self-appointed president Turchinov declared that the anti-terrorist operations to repress the people in east and south Ukraine would recommence. </p><p> And just in the last few hours, we heard that the Right Sector leader, Dmitry Yarosh is sending 1,000 Right Sector paramilitary to the east to start to re-establish order on his terms. This certainly is not going to reduce tensions in the area. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Do you think the West and the US in particular should push Kiev to engage in greater diplomacy?</em> </p><p> <strong>MS:</strong> They certainly should but the indication of Biden, the Ukrainian regime has said publicly that they have the support of Washington to take action, to use military force, whatever they can manage, to repress the people in the east and south of Ukraine. So it does not seem that Washington is willing to back down or to consider the interest of the people of the east and south Ukraine. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154440-conversnitch-lamps-surveillance-tweets/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Coversnitch’ records & tweets New Yorkers’ public conversations]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154440-conversnitch-lamps-surveillance-tweets/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b4/80/00/28.jpg" title="Screenshot from vimeo.com/kylemcdonald"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 03:27:18 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b4/80/00/28.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Americans already paranoid about the NSA monitoring their online communications and Facebook sharing their location will find no comfort with new technology that makes it possible for anyone to install a recording device in any common house lamp.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b4/80/00/28.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Screenshot from vimeo.com/kylemcdonald" /> <p> Kyle McDonald and Brian House, who described themselves as artists during an interview with <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/coversnitch-eavesdropping-lightbulb/" target="_blank">Wired</a>, have posted a video online showing how anyone with $100 can buy the necessary components to build their own light with the ability to listen in on discussions taking place nearby. </p><p> The device known as 'Coversnitch' also purports the ability to post snippets from these conversations directly to Twitter for the world to see. </p><p> “<em>What does it mean to deploy one of these in a library, a public square, someone’s bathroom?

Nealon Federal Building and United States Courthouse, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, USA" /> <p> US prosecutors have charged a 72-year-old Pennsylvania man Harold Rinko, the owner of Global Parts Supply, which exported illegal goods, and brothers Ahmad Deri, a UK national and Moawea Diri, Syrian national for smuggling contraband via third states. </p><p> According to the Justice Department, Diri was arrested in London in March 2013 and is facing extradition to the United States, while his brother Deri remains at large. Prosecution has offered Rinko a plea agreement that is pending court approval. </p><p> A federal judge in Scranton, Pennsylvania, unsealed the case 17 months after Assistant US Attorney Todd Hinkley, signed a plea agreement for one of three men charged in 2012. </p><p> Three men stand accused of illegal export of goods, money laundering, conspiracy, wire fraud, and making false statements. Their criminal actions, the investigators believe range from creating false invoices, undervalued and mislabeled the items, to listing false purchases and buyers before smuggling the goods via United Arab Emirates, Jordan and the United Kingdom for nine years, between 2003 and late 2012. </p><p> Investigation believes that men sold portable instruments used to detect chemical agents, industrial engines used in oil and gas fields, laboratory equipment, a device used to locate buried pipelines and masks used against chemical agents. </p><p> The goods, which are restricted for export by US law, were never sent, Reuters reports, but the men allegedly circumvented federal law that requires a license to export goods, other than humanitarian supplies and medicines, to Syria under the sanctions imposed on Damascus in 2004. </p><p> <em>“No good comes of illegal exports to Syria during this time of gross misgovernment and civil strife,”</em> said John Kelleghan, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Philadelphia, The Times-Tribune quotes. “H<em>SI will do all in its power . . . to ensure that sensitive technology doesn’t fall into the wrong hands in Syria.”’</em> </p><p> The 31-page indictment does not describe how the authorities were able to track down the scheme with Hinkley saying he was unable to comment on it. </p><p> Authorities also claim they do not know who the goods were intended to reach, the government forces or the rebels. “<em>We know they were exported to Syria,”</em> Hinkley said<em>. “The end user information we weren't able, at least to this point, to develop in the investigation.”</em> </p><p> </p><h2> Syria's chemical disarmament on track </h2><p> Meanwhile in Syria, the UN chemical weapons watchdog said Damascus has delivered over 86.5 percent of its chemical arsenal as June 30 deadline to destroy chemical stockpiles approaches. </p><p> <em>“The overall portion of chemicals removed from Syria to 86.5 percent of the total,”</em> The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said in a statement on Wednesday adding that another batch of chemicals was removed from the port of Latakia in the 17th shipment since October. </p><p> <em>“We hope that the remaining two or three consignments are delivered quickly to permit destruction operations to get under way in time to meet the mid-year deadline for destroying Syria's chemical weapons.”</em> </p><h2> UN calls for chlorine attack probe </h2><p> At the same time on Wednesday the UN Security Council called for an investigation into claims of a chlorine gas <a href="http://rt.com/news/syria-gas-attack-chlorine-204" target="_blank">attack</a> in Syria earlier this month. </p><p> After the closed door meeting delegates “expressed concern about alleged reports about the use of chlorine gas in some towns, which left people dead and injured, and called for an investigation of this incident,” said Joy Ogwu the ambassador of Nigeria, which currently holds the rotating presidency in the council. </p><p> <em>“We're still waiting to confirm the authenticity of the reports. Until we have the full facts we cannot take any decision on this matter,”</em> Ogwu said, adding no decision has yet been taken on who would be tasked to investigate the matter. </p><p> Syrian ambassador Bashar Jaafari denied that government forces are using chlorine gas against its own people. “<em>The aim of this kind of allegations emanating from Washington or elsewhere is to overshadow the successful preparations for the presidential elections in Syria,”</em> he said. </p><p> Damascus announced this week that the country will hold a presidential election on June 3. </p><p> French president was among the first to officials to publicly accuse Bashar Assad on Monday of using chlorine in the village of Kafr Zita that has killed two and injured more than 100 people earlier this month. In a rarely cited remark he however added he had no proof to back his claims, but only a <em>“few elements of information.”</em> </p><p> The next day Washington stated that it was investigating the allegations. <em>“We have indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical, probably chlorine, in Syria this month,”</em> said White House spokesman Jay Carney, stressing that the village of Kafr Zita is “opposition-dominated.” </p><p> Under Russian-brokered deal for the Syrian government to get rid of its chemical stockpiles, chlorine – a chemical widely used for commercial and domestic purposes – was not placed on the list. However its use as a chemical weapon it is prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154420-gmo-label-law-vermont/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Vermont poised to enact toughest US GMO-labeling law yet]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154420-gmo-label-law-vermont/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b3/40/00/21.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Robyn Beck "/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 01:36:32 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b3/40/00/21.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Vermont lawmakers have passed legislation that requires food made with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, to be labeled as such.

The state Senate passed the legislation last week by a vote of 28-2. </p><p> The bill would require any foods containing GMOs sold at retail outlets to be labeled as having been produced or partially produced with <em>“genetic engineering.”</em> The law would go into effect on July 1, 2016. </p><p> Gov. Shumlin must now sign the bill to cap the process. He again expressed support for the measure on Wednesday. </p><p> <em>"I am proud of Vermont for being the first state in the nation to ensure that Vermonters will know what is in their food. The Legislature has spoken loud and clear through its passage of this bill,"</em> Shumlin said. <em>"I wholeheartedly agree with them and look forward to signing this bill into law.”</em> </p><p> Anticipating lawsuits from industry, legislators established a fund of up to $1.5 million to help the state pay for defense against any legal action. People can contribute voluntarily to the fund, and settlements won in other court cases can be added to the fund by the state attorney general, the Burlington Free Press <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2014/04/23/gmo-house/8060463/" target="_blank">reported</a>. </p><p> The bill also makes it illegal to call any food that contains GMO ingredients <em>“natural”</em> or <em>“all natural.”</em> </p><p> Maine and <a href="http://rt.com/usa/connecticut-malloy-gmo-labels-148/" target="_blank">Connecticut</a> are the only US states that have passed GMO labeling laws, though their proposals would only go into effect if and when surrounding states also pass similar laws. GMO labeling is required in 64 countries, including the European Union. </p><p> The Center for Food Safety <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/976/ge-food-labeling/state-labeling-initiatives" target="_blank">says</a> dozens of states are considering GMO labeling laws on some level, as there is no federal labeling standard. Polling <a href="http://rt.com/usa/gmo-labeled-majority-americans-601/" target="_blank">suggests</a> over 90 percent of Americans would prefer GMO ingredients in consumables to be labeled to some extent. </p><p> Powerful food industry and biotechnology <a href="http://rt.com/usa/monsanto-patents-sue-farmers-547/" target="_blank">players</a> are currently banding together on <a href="http://rt.com/usa/monsanto-county-ban-gmo-997/" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/washington-gmo-law-food-980/" target="_blank">fronts</a> to protect their investment in GMO technology despite national and international pushback. Their main effort in the US is seen in <a href="http://rt.com/usa/gmo-labeling-koch-monsanto-249/" target="_blank">federal legislation</a> that would block <a href="http://rt.com/usa/colorado-gmo-label-court-945/" target="_blank">states</a> from passing mandatory GMO labeling measures like Vermont’s despite the <em>“right to know”</em> movement’s rising popularity. </p><p> The claim that genetically-engineered food poses no risk to human and environmental health is far from settled, despite the industry's assertions. </p><p> In October, 93 international scientists <a href="http://climate-connections.org/2013/11/02/rifts-emerge-in-scientists-views-on-safety-of-gmos/" target="_blank">said</a> there was a lack of empirical and scientific evidence to support what they called false claims made by the biotech industry about a so-called <em>“consensus”</em> on GMO safety. They said more independent research is needed, as existing studies that say GMOs are safe are overwhelmingly funded and supported by biotech companies. </p><p> The US Department of Agriculture <a href="http://rt.com/usa/usda-gmo-risk-report-537/" target="_blank">recently</a> voiced concerns over the potentially devastating environmental effects of GMOs. </p><p> A recent <a href="http://rt.com/news/gmo-substantial-equivalence-failed-015/" target="_blank">study</a> found that global classification of GMO foods is fundamentally flawed and <em>“has failed miserably”</em> at protecting public health. </p><p> GMOs have been in the food supply since the 1990s, and are included in roughly 70 to 80 percent of products available to American consumers, according to food manufacturers.

The mines are all owned by one of Ukraine's richest man, Rinat Akhmetov of the mining and metallurgical "Metinvest" corporation. </p><p> Angry miners are pressing for wage increases to match region's average pay, better social and living conditions and higher social bonuses. According to the strikers they get between 3,000 ($260) and 6,000 hryvnas ($520), while the average salary in the coal industry in the region is up to 10,000 hryvnas ($860). </p><p> Miners are also refusing to pay a 10 percent tax on their salaries, imposed by the post-coup authorities to restore the Maidan square in Kiev. The square and nearby buildings suffered significant damage during months of rallies and the violent standoff that led to a coup in February. </p><p> According to local media reports miners have seen around a 10 percent cut in their paychecks to restore the Ukrainian capital. </p><p> <em>“I don't understand why are we involved!”</em> one of the protesting miners, Stanislav Denisenko told ITAR-TASS. <em>“It was not us who dismantled the stones and burned the houses down.

The company is locked in negotiations with the strikers. </p><p> International relations expert Mark Sleboda told RT that Kiev cannot afford losing control of <em>“the real bread winner of the Ukraine”</em> – the mining industry. </p><p> <em>“The mining industry employs about 500,000 people throughout the region, provides about 15 percent of the country's GDP and coal alone is 30 percent of Ukraine's energy consumption,”</em> Sleboda says. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154416-la-police-power-cut-guns/</guid><title><![CDATA[LA cops accused of cutting power to marijuana clinic, planting guns]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154416-la-police-power-cut-guns/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b3/00/00/22.jpg" title="Reuters / Kevork Djansezian"/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 00:38:05 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b3/00/00/22.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Two former Los Angeles County deputies were charged Wednesday in connection with allegations they switched off electricity at a medical marijuana dispensary, disabling a surveillance camera and possibly planting firearms there.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b3/00/00/22.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Kevork Djansezian" /> <p> Julio Cesar Martinez, 39, and Anthony Manuel Paez, 32, were initially charged with conspiracy, perjury, and altering evidence although court documents obtained by the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ex-deputies-cameras-20140423,0,2461684.story#axzz2zkNxkBVJ" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a> show that each was charged with two felony counts Wednesday, conspiring to obstruct justice and altering evidence. Martinez also faces additional felony counts of perjury and filing a false report, the paper noted. </p><p> Prosecutors said each ex-officer faces more than seven years in state prison if convicted in connection with the August 2011 incident. </p><p> The trouble began when Martinez and Paez filed a report claiming they were on patrol on West 84th Place in Los Angeles, California when they watched a drug deal take place. One of the suspects appeared to be carrying a gun, the report said, and when the officers gave chase the suspect allegedly fled into a medical marijuana dispensary. </p><p> Martinez asserted that, upon entering the dispensary, he discovered a gun in a garbage can and a second firearm on top of a desk near ecstasy pills. Each of the two would-be offenders were arrested, one charged with possession of an unregistered firearm and another for possession of a controlled substance while armed. </p><p> The Los Angeles District Attorney later announced that the charges against the two men were dropped when the police department’s Internal Criminal Investigation Bureau opened an investigation into the event and found video footage from inside the dispensary that was “inconsistent” with the officers’ report, prosecutors told the Times. </p><p> Court officials refused to go into any more detail, although Los Angeles police have in past incidents proven to be willing and able to fix surveillance devices when the footage, audio or video, may not suit their need. </p><p> An unrelated <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lapd-officers-tampered-with-equipment-001,0,2272132.photo#axzz2zffvmQ7I" target="_blank">LA Times story</a> from earlier this month reveals that an internal LAPD investigation discovered that an estimated 40 out of the 80 cars in a single patrol division in south Los Angeles were missing the antennas used to capture officers’ field communications. </p><p> LAPD Chief Charles Beck and other department brass were informed of the issue nearly a year before it was discovered by Internal Affairs, choosing to not only keep quiet on the matter but also not investigate which officers were involved and issue a department-wide advisory against meddling. </p><p> Police commission President Steve Soboroff told journalist Joel Rubin that his oversight board only learned of the problem in recent weeks. </p><p> “<em>On an issue like this, we need to be brought in right away</em>,” he said. “<em>This equipment is for the protection of the public and of the officers. To have people who don’t like the rules to take it upon themselves to do something like this is very troubling</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/154400-bitcoin-money-currency-internet/</guid><title><![CDATA[​‘Bitcoin better than any form of money that has ever existed before’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/154400-bitcoin-money-currency-internet/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/b2/00/00/17.jpg" title="Reuters / Jim Urquhart "/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 00:09:39 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/b2/00/00/17.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Bitcoin is shaping up to be the currency of the future, enabling people to send and receive money anywhere in the world free of charge in a currency that govts are unable to control, Roger Ver, bitcoin investor and the CEO of Memory Dealers told to RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/b2/00/00/17.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Jim Urquhart " /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why do you think this Moscow Bitcoin conference is important?</em> </p><p> <strong>Roger Ver:</strong> Bitcoin is a global phenomenon. It’s important to everybody on the entire planet. Anybody who uses money, bitcoin is important to them. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Russia isn’t banning bitcoin but when it comes to Russia’s central bank and prosecutor’s office, they are against it; does that suggest bitcoin is not welcome, is that going to change do you think?</em> </p><p> <strong>RV:</strong> I don’t have a direct insight into what goes on inside of Russia but one guy at the conference just a moment ago when I asked that same question, he said nobody cares, so that may be the attitude of the people within Russia. And at the end of the day nobody can block or stop or prevent anyone using bitcoin if they want to, it’s just a protocol and it just works. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>If you had to name three reasons why bitcoin is better than traditional money what would they be?</em> </p><p> <strong>RV:</strong> Bitcoin is the first time anyone can send and receive any amount of money with anyone anywhere on the planet. So that’s one reason. </p><p> You can now send and receive that money without having to pay any fees to Western Union or a bank or anybody like that, so there’s a second. </p><p> And it’s impossible to have your account frozen or seized, that’s just three out of many. I can go on for hours and hours. But bitcoin is so much better than any form of money that’s ever existed before in the history of the world. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What other reasons are there?</em> </p><p> <strong>RV:</strong> No counterfeiting, right? When you or I counterfeit money, we go to jail for counterfeiting, when central banks do it, they call it fancy names like quantative easing or economic stimulus. With bitcoin that can’t happen. There’s a fixed supply of bitcoins, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins and that’s a fantastic benefit that bitcoin has over traditional government issue currencies. </p><p> Another issue is that there are no charge backs, once you’ve been paid with bitcoin you know the money is yours and you don’t have to worry about it being taken away from you months later like you do with a credit card or other forms. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>One of the reasons not to use bitcoin is that it can be used for drug purchases and money laundering, is there a way for it to become safer without losing its independence?</em> </p><p> <strong>RV:</strong> If other people are using bitcoins to buy drugs or launder money, it’s not a danger for me, it’s a danger for those people who are getting caught, and it doesn’t affect my Bitcoins either way at all. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Bitcoin’s price has been on a roller coaster, it went beyond a thousand dollars last year and now it’s less than 500, how can you possibly rely on such a currency?</em> </p><p> <strong>RV:</strong> If you look at it over the last couple of years, anybody who bought bitcoin at any period and held it for more than one year, their bitcoins are worth more now than when they initially brought it. </p><p> So yeah there’s lots of ups and downs and volatility in the market but the overall trend has definitely been up and it’s going to continue to be up as bitcoin gets more and more popularity around the world. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154428-inmate-guard-prison-hostage-trumbull/</guid><title><![CDATA[3 inmates hold officer hostage in Ohio jail]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154428-inmate-guard-prison-hostage-trumbull/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b3/c0/00/23.jpg" title="Reuters / Dominick Reuter "/><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 23:33:30 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b3/c0/00/23.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Three inmates at the Trumbull County Jail in Warren, Ohio held a correctional officer hostage in a jail cell for some four hours, according to local news reports.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b3/c0/00/23.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Dominick Reuter " /> <p> <strong>UPDATE: Hostage situation declared over at approximately 9pm EDT.

The study refers to estimates that some 100,000 Iraqis died as a result of the second Iraq War and two million refugees flooded into neighboring countries. </p><p> The study notes that by 2002, a year before the Iraq war, Saddam Hussein no longer posed any serious threat and that now the threat from Iraq is much greater. </p><p> <em>“Today radical jihadist groups stretching across the Iraqi-Syrian border, pose new terrorist threats to the UK and its allies that might not have existed, at least in this form, had Saddam remained in power,”</em> the book says. </p><p> Malcolm Chalmers, the RUSI research director, notes that Britain’s disastrous mission in Helmand, southern Afghanistan was plagued by a number of poor decisions. The dismissing of the regional governor Sher Mohammad Akhundzada drove many members of his militia to join the insurgency and Taliban foot soldiers were mainly recruited locally and were <em>“motivated much more by opposition to foreign intervention than by global jihadism.”</em> He also notes that opium cultivation is much higher now than it was before the intervention. </p><p> Overall the RUSI research gives British military interventions a six out of ten, citing the first Iraq War of 1991, and smaller scale interventions in Kosovo, Bosnia in the 1990’s and Sierra Leone in 2000 as having more success. </p><p> The figures are the net additional costs of operations and do not include what the armed forces would have spent anyway on training exercises and salaries etc. </p><p> At a time when the UK is undergoing severe defense cuts and many servicemen and women are losing their jobs, the findings of the study will question the wisdom behind expensive military campaigns which have not been a success. <em>“Have Britain’s military endeavours made it, and the world, a safer place – and at what cost?”</em> is the question raised by the books authors. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154424-harshest-abortion-law-signed-mississippi/</guid><title><![CDATA[Country’s harshest anti-abortion law signed in Mississippi]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154424-harshest-abortion-law-signed-mississippi/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b3/80/00/20.jpg" title="Anti-abortion demonstrators protest as they walk past the US Supreme Court.(AFP Photo / Saul Loeb )"/><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 23:14:48 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b3/80/00/20.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />One of the harshest anti-abortion laws in the country will go into effect in Mississippi this summer, barring women from seeking an abortion 20 weeks after the beginning of their last menstrual cycle.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b3/80/00/20.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Anti-abortion demonstrators protest as they walk past the US Supreme Court.(AFP Photo / Saul Loeb )" /> <p> The bill, signed into law by Gov Phil Bryant on Wednesday and going into effect July 1, calculates conception from the first day of a woman’s last period rather than when the egg becomes fertilized and implanted in the uterus. </p><p> The controversial new legislation does not contain exceptions for cases of rape or incest. It does, however, have exceptions for the life of the mother or if the fetus has no chance of survival, the Clarion Ledger reports. </p><p> Several states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas have bans at 20 weeks, when the National Right to Life Committee says <a href="http://www.doctorsonfetalpain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Fetal-Pain-The-Evidence-Feb-2013.pdf" target="_blank">fetuses can begin to feel pain</a>. However, the Journal of American Medicine collected studies that <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=201429" target="_blank">show that fetal pain</a> is unlikely before 23 to 30 weeks. </p><p> Mississippi is the only state to start the abortion clock based on the menstrual cycle, or two weeks before gestation actually begins. That has the effect of banning abortions after 18 weeks in the state, according to the Associated Press. </p><p> Bryant, the first-term Republican governor, has often said he wants to end all abortion in Mississippi. <em>“This measure represents a great effort to protect the unborn in Mississippi,"</em> he said in a statement after the bill was passed on Tuesday. </p><p> Diane Derzis, owner of the only abortion clinic in the state, says that the law will not actually affect Jackson Women’s Health Organization. </p><p> <em>"That's a totally irrelevant piece of legislation that I'm sure was aimed at the clinic. The clinic goes to 16 weeks, so what difference does that bill make?"</em> Derzis told the Jackson Free Press in early March. <em>"They have been posturing and wasting the taxpayers' money for the last month on that piece of legislation, and every legislator there knows that."</em> </p><p> Opponents bashed the lack of rape and incest exceptions in the bill, according to the JFP. <em>“A young woman who is a victim of incest or rape may not know she is pregnant, or may hide a pregnancy due to fear and stigma,”</em> Felicia Brown-Williams, director of public policy for Planned Parenthood Southeast, wrote in a press release. <em>“And no woman who has been raped should be forced to carry a pregnancy that is a result of an attack."</em> </p><p> Democratic State Sen. Deborah Dawkins slammed the bill’s passage. <em>“It occurs to me the past few years that a lot of men do not understand how the female body works,”</em> she said, according to the <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20140401/NEWS010504/304010069" target="_blank">Ledger</a>. <em>“This is about removing the rights of women without means, whether anybody here is willing to admit it or not.”</em> </p><p> House Democratic Leader Bobby Moak noted that the bill opens the state up to lawsuits. <em>“Are we about to go to federal court, the same way we’ve been in federal court since we passed our last abortion law three years ago?”</em> he said. </p><p> Supporters of the Mississippi law point out that Mississippi is in the conservative-leaning 5th Circuit federal appeals court district, the AP reports. The 5th Circuit upheld a similar 20-week ban in Texas last week, but the 9th Circuit struck down a virtually identical bill in Arizona last year. The Arizona bill calculated length of pregnancy from the start of the last menstrual cycle, while the Texas bill calculated gestational age from the time of fertilization. </p><p> The Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that abortions cannot be banned before the fetus is viable, which is believed to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy. Nationwide, only 1.5 percent of abortions happen after 20 weeks, according to a <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/media/fact-sheets/abortion-bans-at-20-weeks.pdf" target="_blank">NARAL Pro-Choice America fact sheet</a>. </p><p> Dawkins said the bill was passed based on politics, not on established medical evidence. <em>"Because this is women's bodies, and they're used to controlling women in so many other ways, they're very comfortable with it,"</em> she said, the JFP reports. </p><p> But Republican State Sen. Angela Hill responded, <em>"This is not about a woman's body. This is about the life of an unborn 20-week baby,"</em> according to the Huffington Post. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154412-bitcoin-future-lie-space/</guid><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s future may lie in space]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154412-bitcoin-future-lie-space/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b2/c0/00/18.jpg" title="Reuters / Jim Urquhart"/><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 22:40:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b2/c0/00/18.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Bitcoin miners hope a new initiative from Dunvegan Space Systems and Deep Space Industries Inc. will make the cryptocurrency more secure and easier to access after the two companies announced they will take the peer-to-peer financial system into space.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b2/c0/00/18.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Jim Urquhart" /> <p> Jeff Garzik, a core bitcoin developer, issued a <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoins-space-one-step-closer-120000757.html" target="_blank">press release</a> Wednesday saying that his company (Dunvegan Space Systems) had teamed up with Deep Space Industries to draw up a preliminary design plan that would “<em>develop an orbital system</em>” for a new, non-profit project called BitSat. If successful, a constellation of BitSat systems will float around earth broadcasting a signal that will essentially act as a backup system for the existing bitcoin network. </p><p> The BitSat itself is a small 10 centimeter box that could be attached to other spacecraft being sent into space. </p><p> “<em>Private spaceflight is breaking big, driving down costs so that great ideas like BitSats are within reach of even volunteer nonprofits</em>,” said Garzik, who is seeking donations to build the space program. “<em>We want to keep bitcoin healthy and free by finding ways to distribute block chain data</em>.” </p><p> BitSats’ developers purport that the project, once in motion, will provide an extra verification layers for encoded blocks of bitcoin, thus making transactions more reliable and perhaps eventually more legitimate in the eyes of the international public. </p><p> “<em>Deep Space is about using space resources – including space itself</em>,” said Rick Tumlinson, chairman of DSI. “<em>BitSat is actually very much in line with our spacecraft development plans, including another private system we will be announcing in a few months using many of the same components and systems. This means much lower costs – very important for the BitSat effort</em>.” </p><p> Garzik simplified his new colleague’s sentiment: “<em>I believe space is the future, and can also be useful right now</em>.” </p><p> He estimated that the project will cost somewhere near $2 million, with just over $100 already donated just hours after news of the BitStats plan was made public. More details, including architecture and spacecraft design, operations concept, and the like, will be made public later this summer on BitSats’ Google Group. </p><p> The announcement comes at a curious time for the increasingly popular currency, with some experts wondering if bitcoin’s own success will ultimately lead to its demise. Governments and financial institutions have not been more encouraging, with the IRS announcing bitcoin would be regulated as a commodity rather than a currency, and the CEO of Chase bank questioning if users should trust bitcoin (price fluctuated from $230 in April 2013 to below $70 in July, then surpassing $600 in November). </p><p> “<em>The rules of the system are not set in stone</em>,” Mike Hearn, a volunteer who helps maintain bitcoin software, told the <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21590766-virtual-currency-it-mathematically-elegant-increasingly-popular-and-highly" target="_blank">Economist</a>. </p><p> “<em>It’s got this kind of watch-like feel to it</em>,” he said, adding that bitcoin may continue ticking, but “<em>a mechanical watch is fragile and can be smashed</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154408-fracking-trial-family-sued/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Family awarded $3 million in first US fracking trial]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154408-fracking-trial-family-sued/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b2/80/00/16.jpg" title="Reuters / Shannon Stapleton "/><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 22:34:59 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b2/80/00/16.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />After three years of legal wrangling, a Texas family has won its case against a company engaged in hydraulic fracturing near their home.

It takes guts to say, ‘I’m going to stand here and protect my family from an invasion of our right to enjoy our property.’</em> </p><p> <em>“It’s not easy to go through a lawsuit and have your personal life uncovered and exposed to the extent this family went through.”</em> </p><p> Aruba Petroleum will appeal the jury’s decision, according to MSNBC. The company argues that there are dozens of gas-drilling operations in the area, thus it is difficult to tell who is responsible for the family’s degenerative health. </p><p> Other companies that own wells around the Parr’s home settled with the family, EcoWatch <a href="http://ecowatch.com/2014/04/23/texas-family-3-million-fracking-trial/" target="_blank">reported</a>. </p><p> The Parrs – Bob, Lisa, and their daughter Emma – said their health suffered beginning just months after hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, operations started in their area, which was in 2008. Lisa said her breathing was impaired, and she was inflicted with nausea and headaches. Bob reported suddenly having around three nosebleeds per week, an anomaly compared to the rest of his life, he said. And Emma also reported nosebleeds, as well as nausea and rashes. She was diagnosed with asthma soon after the drilling began. </p><p> <em>“We can’t drink our well water,”</em> Bob Parr told Dallas’ FOX 4 in 2011. <em>“We can’t breathe the air without getting sick.”</em> </p><p> The lawsuit was definitely not the first levied against a fracking company over health impacts, though it has been common for plaintiffs in such cases to settle with companies along with agreeing to strict gag orders. </p><p> Last year, a Pennsylvania family reached a $750,000 <a href="http://rt.com/usa/gag-order-children-fracking-settlement-982/" target="_blank">settlement</a> with gas companies – Range Resources Corporation, Williams Gas/Laurel Mountain Midstream, and Markwest Energy – after suing them for environmental and health impacts caused by their fracking operations near the gas-rich Marcellus Shale. In exchange for the award, however, Chris and Stephanie Hallowich agreed that no member of their family – even their 7- and 10-year-old children - could comment on the case <em>“in any fashion whatsoever.”</em> </p><p> Anti-fracking advocates see the Parr’s victory as a sign that energy companies, which have worked obsessively to shield themselves from the public harms associated with fracking, may not hold as much sway in the future. </p><p> <em>“When evidence of fracking’s impacts are [sic] shown to an impartial jury in a court of law, they find them to be real and significant,”</em> Earthworks Energy Program Director Bruce Baizel said in a <a href="http://www.earthworksaction.org/media/detail/3_million_fracking_damages_jury_award_shows_why_industry_avoids_trials#When:16:06:00Z" target="_blank">statement</a>. <em>“And it shows why the fracking industry is reluctant to allow lawsuits of this type to go to trial.”</em> </p><p> Baizel said companies attempt to settle out of court, but only with an accompanying gag order that helps hide fracking’s effects. Meanwhile, he said, industry and government continue to insist fracking is harmless. </p><p> <em>“We hope this lawsuit will make regulators, in Texas and around the country, reexamine their assumptions about fracking’s dangers, and their responsibility to keep the public safe,”</em> Baizel said. </p><p> To unleash natural gas deep underground, fracking requires large volumes of water, sand, and chemicals to be pumped underground.

If it proves to be accurate, then a veteran Al-Qaeda member considered by both the US and United Nations to be a supporter of terrorism has taken the helm of a hush-hush base that has been the host of US-led training missions for two years following its refurbishment by American Green Berets. </p><p> An Arabic-language <a href="http://libya-al-mostakbal.org/news/clicked/48212" target="_blank">news report</a> published earlier this month and cited by Lake suggests that Tantoush has recently taken command of the base and, according to the Beast writer, “<em>he was heading a group of Salifist fighters from the former Libyan base</em>.” </p><p> Lake went on to say an unnamed US defense official told The Daily Beast that the Libyan report was on par with what American intelligence knew, and a second official said he could not yet corroborate the facts of the matter. A third official with the US Africa Command declined to comment, and the message boards referenced by the reporter were not cited again elsewhere in his article. </p><p> On Tuesday evening, Lake added, Tantoush appeared on Libyan television and confirmed that he was in the country but not involved whatsoever in the camp. Another US official speaking on condition of anonymity, however, told The Daily Beast that the camp to the west of Tripoli is considered to be a “denied area” which American forces would not be able to easily gain access to. </p><p> Last September, Fox News <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/11/us-military-weapons-equipment-stolen-in-libya-raids/" target="_blank">reported</a> that the base — the same one, according to Lake — was raided multiple times in August likely by terrorists who had taken a cache of equipment and weapons used by US Special Forces stationed in the region. </p><p> A grand jury in the Southern District of the New York <a href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/NSQI05702E.shtml" target="_blank">indicted</a> Tantoush and four others back in 2000 for conspiracy related to terrorist attacks carried out by Al-Qaeda, and since 2002 he has been <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/terror.txt" target="_blank">included</a> on a Department of the Treasury list of foreign persons sanctioned for terroristic activity as outlined in an UN treaty. </p><p> <em>"No one at the State Department wanted to deal with the situation if any more went wrong, so State pulled its support for the training program and then began to try and get the team moved out of the country,”</em> Fox reportedly heard from an unnamed source. </p><p> Speaking to Lake, Al-Qaeda expert Seth Jones said <em>“There are a number of training camps for a wide range of Al-Qaeda and jihadist groups that have surfaced in southwest Libya, northwest Libya in and around Tripoli and northeast Libya in and around Benghazi.”</em> Only now, however, have militants reportedly taken hold of a formerly US-run base that had been launched to counter those same terrorists. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154392-thousands-voters-registered-maryland-virginia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Virginia, Maryland plagued with 44k duplicate voters]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154392-thousands-voters-registered-maryland-virginia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b1/80/00/9.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Mandel Ngan "/><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 20:31:20 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b1/80/00/9.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Over 44,000 people are registered to vote in both Virginia and Maryland, Virginia Voters Alliance, an advocacy group that monitors voting in the state, announced on Wednesday. Among them 164 people voted in both states during the 2012 general election.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b1/80/00/9.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Mandel Ngan " /> <p> <em>“The Virginia Voters Alliance is investigating how to identify voters who are registered and vote in Virginia but live in the states that surround us,”</em> VVA President Reagan George told the State Board of Elections, according to <a href="http://watchdog.org/140187/duplicate-voters-virginia/?roi=echo3-20114407974-19305415-22338a1b84b4567aaa911f2ca887de17"> Watchdog.org</a>. </p><p> VVA, in working with the Privileges and Elections committees of the state House and Senate, identified 31,000 dead Virginia voters who were still registered, though the number could be as high as 60,000 dead registrations, Watchdog.org reports. </p><p> Before the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election, Watchdog.org reported that at least 300,000 people registered in the commonwealth were also registered in another state. The State Board of Elections asked local registrars to review potential duplicate voters between August 23 and October 1, 2013. However, there were no requirements to comply or penalties for non-compliance. </p><p> Virginia became a member of the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck, which is run by the Kansas Board of Elections with assistance from Arkansas. The program covers 27 states. According to the Daily Kos, each state receives a list of potential duplicate voters based on first name, last name and date of birth. It is then up to the state to use their own procedures to purge verified duplicates from its system. </p><p> But election officials told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that being registered in multiple states isn’t necessarily fraudulent, as duplicate registration can occur when people move or change names. Virginia used only information from states that also provided the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers, which they say is more reliable. </p><p> The state discovered 164,000 duplicate voters, but about 97,000 of them were considered active voters. <em>“It doesn’t mean that they have actually voted, it just means that they are on the rolls,”</em> Matthew J. Davis, information services manager with the elections board, said. </p><p> According to the <a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/virginia-politics/thousands-of-va-voters-on-the-rolls-in-other-states/article_3ce0c700-9ac9-53c1-8bfa-54619d917feb.html"> Times-Dispatch</a>, <em>“Once a dual match has been confirmed as accurate, Section 8 of the National Voting Rights Act allows the removal of voters from the rolls only if they either confirm in writing that they changed their address or fail to respond to a notice and fail to vote in the next two federal general elections.”</em> </p><p> It is up to voters to notify their local election office that they have moved out of the jurisdiction. <em>"The assumption, I would think, is that they would do the courtesy of letting the other states know that if you're registered with a new state, [the old registration] would no longer apply,"</em> Ben Skupien, a registered voter in Northern Virginia who believes he may be registered in at least five other states, told NPR. </p><p> VVA is calling on the Virginia State Board of Elections to tighten the commonwealth’s voter ID law, require proof of citizenship to vote, investigate voting irregularities in Virginia’s nursing homes and rehabilitation centers and audit felons annually on their ability to vote. </p><p> Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.) announced Friday he will reduce the waiting period for convicted felons seeking restoration of their voting rights, Community Digital News reports. He will also remove drug offenses from the list of violent felonies, which will allow non-violent offenders to be eligible to vote immediately after finishing their sentences. </p><p> In Maryland, Election Integrity Maryland, a similar watchdog group to VVA, has notified the State Board of Elections of nearly 18,000 voter registration problems in six of the state’s 24 counties. Those discrepancies include multi-state registration, duplicate in-state registration, and registration addresses listing businesses or vacant lots. </p><p> <em>“</em><em>We conﬁrmed with the State Board of Elections that somehow votes had been cast after death certiﬁcates had been issued for three individuals. These zombie cases were referred to the State Prosecutor’s O</em><em>ﬃ</em><em>ce and Attorney General [Doug] Gansler's o</em><em>ﬃ</em><em>ce,”</em> the <a href="http://electionintegritymaryland.com/archives/category/eim-news"> EIM website</a> states. <em>“Of special signiﬁcance, 173 cases of duplicate voting in both Maryland and Florida was discovered. These cases are likewise in the hands of the Attorney General's o</em><em>ﬃ</em><em>ce.”</em> </p><p> In July 2013, Maryland indicted two people on charges of voter fraud, according to Southern Maryland Newspapers Online. One woman was accused of impersonating her dead mother and reactivating her voter registration. The other was accused of trying to vote in her mother’s name. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154388-train-crash-deadly-congo/</guid><title><![CDATA[Congo train crash: Over 60 killed, 80 injured]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154388-train-crash-deadly-congo/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b1/40/00/10.jpg" title="Reuters / Goran Tomasevic"/><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 19:49:02 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b1/40/00/10.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />At least 63 people were killed and 80 seriously injured when a train exceeding the speed limit derailed going round a bend in Democratic Republic of Congo on Tuesday, a local minister said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b1/40/00/10.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Goran Tomasevic" /> <p> Fifty more people remain trapped inside the train after the accident, according to Reuters. A rescue team is working on the scene. <br><br> On Tuesday, 12 carriages of the goods train derailed near Likasi, a mining town between the cities of Lubumbashi and Kolwezi in the copper and cobalt-rich southeast Katanga province. <br><br><em>"Evidently the train was going too fast, the driver came to a curve and had to break suddenly leading to the accident,"</em> said Dikanga Kazadi, Katanga's interior minister. <br><br> A team has been sent to investigate the causes of the accident. <br><br> There are no Russian citizens among the victims, Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. <br><br> In 2007 over 100 people were killed in a similar accident involving a goods train in the southern province of Kasai-Occidental. <br><br> The country's infrastructure is in poor condition due to years of civil wars and neglect of funding. Because of a First Congo War in 1996-97 the railway system was not functioning from 1998 until June 2004. During the war 500 kilometers of railway in the provinces of Maniema and Katanga were destroyed. Despite foreign support, Congo Railway Company (CNC) was on the brink of collapse in 2010. In June 2010 the World Bank gave Congo a US$ 255 million grant in order to refurbish the railway system. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154372-jeb-bush-presidential-run-2016/</guid><title><![CDATA[Jeb Bush admits he's considering presidential run in 2016]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154372-jeb-bush-presidential-run-2016/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b0/40/00/7.jpg" title="Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.(Reuters / Mary F.

Calvert)" /> <p> According to Politico, one of the attendees said Bush was asked about the prospect of a presidential run in 2016, and the former Florida governor acknowledged he is <em>“thinking about running for president.”</em> </p><p> Bush added that he would make a decision sometime after the 2014 midterm elections are over later this year. </p><p> After an attendee told Bush they hope he will decide to run, he jokingly asked, <em>"Would you call and tell my mom?"</em> Last year, Barbara Bush told NBC <em>“we've had enough Bushes”</em> in the White House. </p><p> Although speculation regarding Bush’s political ambitions has been a popular topic of discussion, recent polling suggests he has some formidable obstacles to overcome if he’s to become the United States’ 45th president. </p><p> According to a new Economist/YouGov poll, the general public isn’t excited about the prospect of having a third member of the Bush family assume the presidency. Of those who had an unfavorable opinion of Bush, many expressed concern over the idea of having a “dynasty” at the presidential level – something that may come into play should Hillary Clinton decide to run as well – and were also wary of ties to his brother and his conservative values. </p><p> Meanwhile, conservatives themselves aren’t quite sold on Bush, either, with only 18 percent of them telling pollsters they want him to run in 2016. </p><p> Recently, however, Bush made headlines for diverging from mainstream Republican opinion on topics such as education policy and immigration reform. On Wednesday he noted that his support for Common Core – federal education standards that specify what students across the country should know by the time they finish each grade in school – is not popular among potential Republican opponents like Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. </p><p> Bush also drew the ire of some conservatives when he spoke at an event commemorating the 25th anniversary of George H.W. Bush’s presidency earlier this month, when he said immigrants come to the US illegally out of an <em>“act of love.”</em> </p><p> <em>“The way I look at this is someone who comes to our country because they couldn’t come legally, they come to our country because their families -- the dad who loved their children -- was worried that their children didn’t have food on the table.”</em> </p><p> <em>“Yes, they broke the law, but it’s not a felony,”</em> he added. <em>“It’s an act of love. It’s an act of commitment to your family. I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime that there should be a price paid, but it shouldn’t rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families."</em> </p><p> At Wednesday’s fundraiser, Bush was advised not to “back down” from his position. </p><p> <em>“Why would I back down from it?”</em> he asked. <em>“It’s the right thing to do…we’ve got to be an inclusive party.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154316-benghazi-attack-us-fault/</guid><title><![CDATA[Benghazi attack resulted from US 'allowing arms deliveries' to militants]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154316-benghazi-attack-us-fault/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ac/c0/00/000_hkg7812154.jpg" title="A vehicle (R) and the surrounding buildings burn after they were set on fire inside the US consulate compound in Benghazi late on September 11, 2012.

(AFP Photo)" /> <p> “<em>The White House and senior Congressional members deliberately and knowingly pursued a policy that provided material support to terrorist organizations in order to topple a ruler [Muammar Gaddafi] who had been working closely with the West actively to suppress al-Qaeda,</em>” the Citizens Commission on Benghazi (CCB) said in an interim <a href="http://www.aim.org/benghazi/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CCB-Interim-Report-4-22-2014.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released Tuesday. </p><p> As a result of such policy, there has been “utter chaos” in Libya, across North Africa and beyond, “<em>the spread of dangerous weapons (including surface-to-air missiles), and the empowerment of jihadist organizations like al-Qa’eda and the Muslim Brotherhood,</em>” the group said in the document, entitled “How America Switched Sides in the War on Terror.” </p><p> The commission, set up last year by US center-right press watchdog Accuracy in Media (AIM), is comprised of retired senior military officers and CIA insiders and experts. Its goal is to answer the remaining questions about the September 11, 2012 attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. </p><p> Following a seven-month review of the bloody incident, the Commission blamed the Obama administration for failing to prevent a multi-million dollar United Arab Emirates weapons shipment from getting into hands of al-Qaeda-linked militants. </p><p> </p><p> “<em>The United States switched sides in the war on terror with what we did in Libya, knowingly facilitating the provision of weapons to known al-Qaeda militias and figures,</em>” Clare Lopez, a member of the commission and a former CIA officer, told the MailOnline. </p><p> Lopez claimed that the weapons that came into the city of Benghazi “were permitted to enter” by American armed forces who were blockading the approaches from air and sea. </p><p> “<em>They were permitted to come in. ... [They] knew these weapons were coming in, and that was allowed,</em>” she said. “<em>The intelligence community was part of that, the Department of State was part of that, and certainly that means that the top leadership of the United States, our national security leadership, and potentially Congress – if they were briefed on this – also knew about this</em>.” </p><p> Now all those arms are in Syria, according to another commission member, Retired Rear Admiral Chuck Kubic. </p><p> Talking to journalists on Tuesday, he noted that Gaddafi, Libya’s overthrown and killed leader, “<em>was not a good guy, but he was being marginalized</em>.” </p><p> According to the commission findings, shortly after the beginning of the Libyan uprising in February 2011, Gaddafi “<em>offered to abdicate</em>.” However, Washington, “<em>ignored his calls for a truce</em>,” the group wrote, which led to extensive loss of life – including the four Americans – chaos, and detrimental outcomes for U.S. national security objectives across the region. </p><p> “<em>We had a leader who had won the Nobel Peace Prize</em>,” Kubic said, “<em>but who was unwilling to give peace a chance for 72 hours</em>.” </p><p> On March 21, 2011, the US Army General Carter Ham, who was leading the American forces enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya, said that attacking Gaddafi was not part of the mission. </p><p> That, Kubic noted, was a signal to the Libyan leader that there was a chance for a deal. </p><p> “<em>By 22 March 2011, Qaddafi verifiably had begun to pull his forces back from key rebel-held cities such as Benghazi and Misrata. Word was passed that he wanted a way out of the crisis and was willing to step down and permit a transition government to take power in his stead,</em>” the report said. </p><p> </p><p> In exchange for the stepping down, Gaddafi reportedly wanted permission to continue fighting al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) – the north-African wing of the terrorist organization. The second condition was the lifting of the sanctions against Gaddafi himself, his family members and people loyal to him. </p><p> However, the CCB said, despite the willingness of both the US Army General and the Libyan leader to pursue the possibility of truce talks, “<em>permission was not given to Gen. Ham from his chain of command in the Pentagon and the window of opportunity closed</em>.” </p><p> The Obama Administration and the National Security Staff did not immediately respond to questions about the commission's findings, the Daily Mail reported. </p><p> “<em>We don't claim to have all the answers here,</em>” Roger Aronoff, AIM’s editor told journalists. “<em>We hope you will, please, pursue this. Check it out. Challenge us</em>,” he added. </p><p> The Commission’s findings are based on information they got from interviews with “several knowledgeable sources,” they said. As part of the investigation, the CCB along with AIM have also filed 85 document requests under the Freedom of Information Act. The requests were addressed to the Department of State, Department of Defense, CIA and FBI. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154376-ebola-outbreak-death-toll/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ebola outbreak: Death toll rises to over 140]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154376-ebola-outbreak-death-toll/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b0/80/00/6.jpg" title="A scientist separates blood cells from plasma cells to isolate any Ebola RNA in order to test for the virus at the European Mobile Laboratory in Gueckedou April 3, 2014.(Reuters / Misha Hussain)"/><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 19:00:01 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b0/80/00/6.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A total of 142 deaths have now been recorded from the Ebola outbreak in Guinea and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

While neighboring Liberia has found 34 clinically compatible cases, including six deaths. </p><p> The outbreak began at the beginning of the year in the forested villages of southeast Guinea, and then appeared in the capital Conakry. </p><p> As little as nine days ago the number of deaths and infections had begun to fall and it seemed that the outbreak was under control. The latest figures have quashed any hope that the spread of the disease is being contained. </p><p> There are several theories about how the disease has spread. A study published in the New England Journal last week said that the virus was due to <em>“the emergence of a new EBOV strain in Guinea.”</em> </p><p> Normally Ebola is endemic to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Uganda, South Sudan and Gabon in Central Africa but the latest research shows that it was not introduced from this region. </p><p> <em>“This study demonstrates the emergence of a new EBOV strain in Guinea.

So far samples from Ghana and Sierra Leone have been negative. </p><p> There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which takes its name from a river in the DRC, and in up to 90 percent of cases it kills. </p><p> Symptoms are horrifying and begin with nausea, which then deepens into diarrhea, vomiting and internal and external bleeding. </p><p> The virus most likely was spread from an animal, probably a fruit bat, which is common over vast areas of West Africa. Officials think someone ate the meat of an infected bat, which then spread the infection. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/154384-reddit-r-technology-censorship/</guid><title><![CDATA[Reddit forum downgraded after moderators accused of censorship]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/154384-reddit-r-technology-censorship/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b1/00/00/5.jpg" title="Reuters / Robert Galbraith"/><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 18:47:50 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/b1/00/00/5.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Moderators for Reddit.com are coming under attack after being accused of censoring certain posts on the website’s technology forum.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b1/00/00/5.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Robert Galbraith" /> <p> Administrators at the immensely popular link-sharing site now say that the forum, /r/technology, has been downgraded due to its mods’ behavior. </p><p> Earlier this month, Kevin Collier at the Daily Dot <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-technology-banned-words/" target="_blank">claimed</a> that an automated bot deployed on r/r/technology was secretly deleting posts with headlines that contained any of roughly 50 words likely to provoke heated discussion. </p><p> According to Collier’s report, headlines with words such as “NSA,” “net neutrality,” “Comcast” and “Bitcoin” were being deleted by the subreddit’s moderators, censoring those posts from being seen by the forum’s roughly 5 million subscribers. </p><p> Almost all of those words, Collier wrote, have at least two qualities: “<em>they're commonly found in the intersection of technology and politics, and they can be seen as controversial, or at least likely to inspire anger in a few people</em>.” </p><p> Collier’s attempt to get a reply from the site was not immediately successful, but the BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27100773" target="_blank">reported</a> on Monday this week that Reddit’s administrators have responded by downgrading the technology forum. </p><p> Up until this week, /r/technology was considered a “default subreddit” that was automatically promoted to new account holders. </p><p> "<em>We decided to remove /r/technology from the default list because the moderation team lost focus of what they were there to do: moderate effectively</em>," director of communications for Reddit, Victoria Taylor, told the BBC. </p><p> "<em>We're giving them time to see if we feel they can work together to resolve the issue</em>,” added Taylor. "<em>We might consider adding them back in the future if they can show us and the community that they can overcome these issues</em>." </p><p> Alan Wezelblat, a copyright and intellectual property blogger, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2014/04/22/reddits-rtechnology-demote.html" target="_blank">told</a> the website Boing Boing that the technology forum “<em>has scrubbed its moderator team</em>” of volunteers as a result of the scandal. A similar subreddit, /r/tech, claims to have seen “<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/23rnfm/welcome_new_subscribers_to_rtech_four_topics_up/" target="_blank">absolutely staggering</a>” growth in the days since the Daily Dot article broke. </p><p> Back on the /r/technology forum, Redditors there said a new team has been established that is “<em>committed to maintaining a transparent style of moderation</em>." </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154368-london-smog-pollution-paris/</guid><title><![CDATA[London to be ‘smogged’ by polluted Paris]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154368-london-smog-pollution-paris/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/b0/00/00/3.jpg" title="London.

(Reuters / Olivia Harris)" /> <p> High concentrations of harmful particles from the French capital, which has been battling severe air pollution for the past month, are set to drift northward to southeast England, said environmental experts from King’s College London, the Evening Standard reported. <br><br> The UK’s Met Office added that the emissions will be blown by strong south-easterly winds until Friday. <br><br> The researchers from King’s College London warned that polluted air would “<em>dip into Central France and travel over Paris before arriving in the southeast.”</em> They added that the emission levels recorded in Paris on Sunday suggested <em>“widespread”</em> pollution across London and Sussex. <br><br><em>“There is no reason why Londoners should have to breathe in their fumes. They should clean up their dirty air,”</em> Bob Neill, the Conservatives’ vice-chairman for local government, said of the authorities in Paris, the Evening Standard reported. <br><br> It will take a few days to analyze the data and confirm the source of the smog when it reaches English shores, media reported. Meanwhile, pollution from other European cities such as Brussels and Amsterdam could also affect the quality of air in the UK’s southeast. <br><br> In March, Paris’s polluting particulates in the air exceeded safe levels for five straight days. Particles in Paris hit the maximum of 180 micrograms per cubic meter, doubly the allowed 80 per cubic meter standard of the so-called PM10 pollution particles emitted by heavy industry and vehicles. This level was comparable with the world’s most notoriously smoggy cities, such as Beijing and New Delhi. </p><p> </p><p> In an attempt to tackle the problem, Parisian authorities called on citizens to leave personal vehicles at home by making all public transport in the capital free for four days in March. Following this, the authorities resorted to drastic measures, forcing vehicles with number plates ending in even numbers off the road for the first time in two decades. The move did not affect electric and hybrid cars, or any vehicle carrying three people or more. <br><br> France’s Green Party has proposed for vehicles to be banned on alternate days, depending on their number plate, and for trucks to be temporarily banned in Paris. <br><br> Experts say that the smog is lingering because of bright sunny days and cold nights in the French capital. <br><br> Unusually high levels of air pollution smothered London and other cities earlier in April after a storm of Saharan dust, emissions from the Continent, low southeasterly winds and local pollution. <br><br> Air pollution has become one of the biggest environmental risks, according to the World Health Organization. Government health advisors said that in 2013 over 29,000 people were killed by air pollution in the UK. <br><br> The UK faces fines of up to £300 million ($500 million) following the European Commission’s legal action against the country in February for failing to reduce <em>"excessive"</em> levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution from traffic, despite 15 years of warnings and several postponements granted to the government. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/154308-snowden-glasgow-university-rector/</guid><title><![CDATA[Students’ choice Snowden takes up post as Glasgow University rector]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/154308-snowden-glasgow-university-rector/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ac/40/00/10169383_784768164876234_4958671758599209017_n.jpg" title="Installation of Edward Snowden as University of Glasgow Rector (Image from facebook.com/glasgowuniversity)"/><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 17:16:56 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ac/40/00/10169383_784768164876234_4958671758599209017_n.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has been inaugurated as the Rector of the University of Glasgow after a sweeping win at a student vote.

The nearest other candidate, the Episcopalian rector of St Mary’s Cathedral in Glasgow, Kevin Holdsworth, got 1,563 votes, while “The Flying Scotsman,” world racing cyclist champion Graeme Obree, got 1,412 votes. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> All upstanding as that concludes this morning's proceedings.<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gurector&amp;src=hash">#gurector</a><a href="http://t.co/1ISm6ODcT4">pic.twitter.com/1ISm6ODcT4</a> </p> <p> — GlasgowUniEvents (@GlasgowUniEvent) <a href="https://twitter.com/GlasgowUniEvent/statuses/458915646785748992"> April 23, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> This puts the whistleblower in a long list of the university’s rectors, who <em>“often reflected the political feelings”</em> of the students, GUSRC’s president, Jess McGrellis, said in a speech Wednesday. <br><br> A statement from the student group which nominated Snowden said: <em>“We have a proud and virtuous tradition of making significant statements through our rectors and today we have once more championed this idea by proving to the world that we are not apathetic to important issues such as democratic rights. Our opposition to pervasive and immoral state intrusion has gone down in the records. What is more, we showed Edward Snowden and other brave whistleblowers that we stand in solidarity with them, regardless of where they are.”</em> <br><br> The group vowed to continue campaigning <em>“for the NSA and GCHQ to cease their assault on our fundamental right to privacy”</em> and for Snowden’s recognition <em>“as the courageous whistleblower he is, rather than a traitor.”</em> <br><br> Answering concerns of some of the students that Snowden will not be able to be a <em>“working”</em> or active rector as he is not leaving Russia, McGrellis said <em>“Mr Snowden is looking to work with the SRC and students to make sure issues at University are not forgotten.”</em> She also encouraged students <em>“to get in touch with both our new rector and the SRC to ensure all student issues are raised.”</em> </p><p> <iframe src="//instagram.com/p/nIQgsIzfgt/embed/" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" width="612"></iframe> </p><p> Famous figures who previously occupied the post of Glasgow University rector include Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith, French President Raymond Poincaré, several British prime ministers, prominent politicians, actors and journalists. In 1987-90, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, wife of the late anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela, was the university’s Rector, while another South African politician, Nobel Peace Prize winner Albert Lutuli, was voted into the post in 1962. While some of those receiving the post actively participated in the university’s life, others were unable to do so, treating it rather as an honorary title. <br><br> Curiously, Snowden has not been the first whistleblower to become the rector of the university, as in 2004 it was given to former Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu, who exposed Israel’s nuclear weapons program to the UK media and was subsequently abducted by Mossad in Italy, spending nearly two decades in jail thereafter. <br><br> According to the official GUSRC website, <em>“the main role of the rector is to represent the university’s students… The rector has a number of key duties representing students. He/she is expected to attend meetings of court, the governing body of the university, to work closely with the SRC, and to bring student concerns to the attention of the university’s managers.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
