(Reuters)" /> <p> On April 28 an Egyptian court sentenced Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Mohamed Badie and 682 of its supporters to death. They faced charges of murder and attempted murder of several policemen during riots by Morsi supporters in the southern province of Minya on August 14 last year. Just a month ago, the same judge, Said Youssef, <a href="http://rt.com/news/155284-egypt-court-death-penalty/" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to death 529 supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi after just a two-day trial. All but 37 defendants had their sentences commuted to life. President Morsi was removed by the military last July and since then Egypt has seen large scale persecution and elimination of Muslim Brotherhood members. </p><p> The recent verdict turned out to be a real shock for the international community, with many voices calling for external involvement aimed at stopping bloodshed and cleansing. The news has stirred up social media.

Defense lawyer Ahmed Hefni told reporters outside the court that the death sentences now will be submitted to Egypt's Mufti for the approval, the highest religious authority, but his decision is mostly a formality and is not legally binding. </p><h2> MB goes underground </h2><p> The Muslim Brotherhood has been labeled an illegal organization, with over 16,000 members arrested or killed. After taking power for the first time in 2012, the Muslim Brotherhood now has to go underground. Moreover, as Egypt plunges into a new era of even more bloody dictatorship it presents the severest challenge to the state’s stability since the time of Nasser. The Brothers are being forced to resort to violence and reorganize into a quasi-militia to protect their members. The possibility of a new wave of deadly attacks carried out by Brothers shouldn’t be ruled out. </p><p> It’s obvious that there is no room for justice in Egypt now. The UN and human rights activists have denounced the speedy character of the trials, though it seems to be ignored by Egypt’s authorities. Many of those accused are believed not to have been present at the riots near police stations. </p><p> </p><p> Lack of proof, extremely fast trials with no access by the families of the defendants, limited options of punishment, namely life sentence and death – all these speak for themselves. The ruling authorities are continuing a violent crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood who represent a significant force in Egypt. In other words, it seems that the military, headed by al-Sisi who is expected to be the “winner” at the presidential polls, are pursuing a policy of political cleansing, paving the way for themselves, and getting rid of any strong rivals…or rivals in general. </p><h2> Who is next? </h2><p> On the same day, April 28, an Egyptian court banned all April 6 Movement activities inside Egypt and ordered the confiscation of its headquarters. </p><p> The April 6 Youth Movement is an opposition political movement founded in 2008 by a number of young people in support of a general strike held then by textile workers of Al-Mahalla, the largest city of the Gharbiya governorate, which is about 80 km north of Cairo. April 6 played a significant role in the January 25 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak in 2011. It also opposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, arguing he did not fulfill his presidential campaign promises, and protested against the military regime installed after Morsi’s overthrow. The case against April 6 was filed by lawyer Ashraf Said who is accusing the movement of defaming the country’s image and colluding with foreign parties. Its leader Ahmed Maher is already serving a three-year jail term for violating a law that bans all but police-sanctioned protests. </p><p> Hence, one more political player in Egypt is under attack. While nobody knows how the case against the April 6 movement would end up, and so it makes any adversaries of military rule think they could be next. </p><p> <em>Irina Sukhoparova, RT</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155372-tornado-mayflower-arkansas-twister/</guid><title><![CDATA[Mayflower Arkansas devastation: Deadly tornado destroys everything in its path]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155372-tornado-mayflower-arkansas-twister/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/c0/00/tornado-mayflower-arkansas-storm.jpg" title="A damaged vehicle is seen amid debris after a tornado hit the town of Mayflower, Arkansas around 7:30 pm CST, late April 27, 2014.

Alves seem totally nonplussed, peeling and taking a bite out of the banana before tossing it to one side and kicking the ball back into play. </p><p> <iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/MvgbWvebU7e/embed/simple" frameborder="0" height="600" width="600"></iframe> </p><p> <em>"I don't know who threw the banana, but I want to thank him.

Now Kabul is asking them not to leave Afghanistan so that the Taliban will not attack them,” a Pashtun from Kabul in his Moscow shop muses.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/c0/00/afghanistan.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="" /> <p> <em>“Just imagine: we had 44 countries invading Afghanistan with modern weapons, satellite monitoring, tanks and missiles. The Taliban has an army of less than 20,000. We have 400,000 Afghan troops and 200,000 Americans with the most advanced weaponry. How is it possible that they can’t prevail over the Taliban?”</em> he says. </p><p> A PhD-qualified engineer by profession, he trades a range of Oriental items from hookahs to incense sticks. We’ve been talking about the elections for two hours, with visitors coming in and leaving without being served, and other Afghans joining our discussion with eagerness. </p><p> There are only a handful of places in Moscow where you can get a glimpse of people from different Afghan tribes and social strata. One of them is a former hotel in the city suburbs housing a multitude of shops and firms owned by Afghans. They all retain close ties with their homeland, make regular visits and keep daily contact with their families and business partners. </p><p> Those who do business in Russia usually have quite a good background and a decent profession. They work here despite the fact the clans they come from fought the Soviet army in 1979-1989. But that was a long time ago. The US army has been in Afghanistan for 13 years and Afghans do not have much respect for either the Americans or those who they support. </p><h2> Endangered elections </h2><p> Elections in the east are being increasingly associated with terror acts and mysterious problems with vote counting. </p><p> Ironically, political analysts may soon pick up some of the language used by journalists. The developments in Afghanistan and Iraq indicate that elections in a country with a US troop presence are always hailed as success, while a vote in a country left by US troops merely serves as a backdrop for terror attacks. </p><p> Curiously enough, in the old Western democracies the elites negotiate before the elections, whereas in Afghanistan, it looks like the election comes prior to negotiations. This seems to be the only explanation as to why it takes them almost three weeks to count the votes, and why they’ve postponed the announcement of the results for the 4th time. The election took place on April 5 and the votes were supposed to be counted by April 24. Then it was postponed to May 14, so that the second round could start on May 28. </p><p> I’d like to remind that four years ago, it took Iraq a record four months to count the votes from its election. The current prime minister stayed in office, but his bloc in the parliament lost one vote to the opposition. </p><p> The behind-the-scenes struggle continues in Afghanistan. It would be naïve to believe that the Afghan independent commission is unable to count quickly. The clans and advisers just didn’t rush it, as they were fighting for the second round and for the difference in votes. </p><p> Right now this difference has become more distinct, when the conventional anti-Americanism pole represented by Abdullah Abdullah got the upper hand over the most pro-American candidate, Ashraf Ghani. </p><p> </p><p> This division is quite feeble though. Before the election they both had stated that they supported the presence of the US troops in the country. Whereas President Karzai finished his tenure with a patriotic gesture of refusing to sign the agreement for the US troop presence. He also took his brother off the presidential candidates’ list and directed his supporters to unlikely candidate Zamlai Rassoul. </p><p> At the moment, according to another preliminary count, Abdullah Abdullah wins this election. He looks more or less remote from the occupation forces compared to other candidates. His name is associated with Ahmad Shakh Massoud, who was mysteriously murdered on September 11, 2001. Many believe he was a Mujahideen physician, if not a Mujahideen himself. </p><p> Abdullah does have a flaw in his biography. From the viewpoint of a Pashtun, the main Afghan tribe, he is a Tajik, as is his mother. <em>“Can a Tajik rule Afghanistan?”</em> This is something any Pashtun would ask you, unless they are related to the occupation forces. Moreover, his name is related to the reputation of the Afghan Northern Alliance, which welcomed the US presence and had close cooperation with it. </p><p> However, for Afghans one’s origin isn’t the main concern. More importantly, these people who really value their independence feel that they have been invaded, in spite of the elections, speeches and promises. The behind-the-scenes war which they sense more clearly than the foreign observers do is a part of this invasion. </p><h2> Difficult choice </h2><p> What do the Afghan people think of the election? Most of the Moscow-based Afghans are happy to discuss it, but they don’t want their pictures taken. </p><p> Young Pashtuns aren’t very optimistic. I am talking to a Pashtun from Herat. He says he preferred Mohammad Ismail Khan, if anyone. He may be a Tajik but he is a Mujahideen, Herat-born and had been its governor for a long time. </p><p> <em>“Otherwise they all are crooks, and all they want is to sell out to the Americans,”</em> he says about the presidential candidates. </p><p> I ask him to clarify what’s there to sell in Afghanistan, as none of the shops have any Afghan products. </p><p> <em>“What’s there to sell? The whole of Afghanistan,”</em> he answers. </p><p> Most Afghans are convinced that their country is a crucial strategic center that the US wants to have just for the sake of it. </p><p> A Pashtun from Kabul has no respect for either of the candidates. He believes there was no voter turnout at all. Some of his family members did go to vote, and they told him there was no frenzy there. </p><p> A Pashtun called Nabi was born in Laghman. He had spent 10 years in prison during the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. He is an Afghan Marxist, and as most supporters of one Marxist fraction he became imprisoned when the other fraction got the upper hand. Just like many older Afghans, he is an underground revolutionary, a fighter, and a political prisoner who got self-educated while in prison, and his opinions are quite harsh. </p><p> The reason he doesn’t support Abdullah is not the fact that he is a Tajik. <em>“Hekmatyar is a Pashtun, but he is also a traitor, just like Abdullah is. And so is Sayyaf - a Pashtun and a traitor,”</em> he says. Marxists are very open about using strong terms. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“Abdullah bears the shadow of a traitor, as he had cooperated with everyone, just like his commander, Massoud,”</em> says Nabi. <em>“His people sold our concessions for mineral deposits extraction.”</em> </p><p> Nabi prefers Ghani, even though he bears <em>“a stamp of the American past.”</em> </p><p> Khusrow, a Tajik from Herat, openly chooses Abdullah because he is Tajik. </p><p> <em>“His mother is Tajik, so Pashtuns regard him as a stranger,”</em> he says. <em>“They say that he, who shakes hands with the ruler, will come to power too,”</em> he is trying to say that those people who are on a first-name basis with the authorities are well connected. </p><p> <em>“Abdullah will definitely get more votes, but such people as Abdullah can never be president. So Ghani is more likely to become the leader,”</em> he sadly says. <em>“Pashtuns will always rule in Afghanistan, and all the others will play football and fight,”</em> Khusrow predicts. </p><p> His Tajik friend who comes from Kabul has moved his family to India. </p><p> <em>“I’m not into politics. We didn’t vote for anyone – there is nobody worth voting for.”</em> </p><p> The Hazara brothers, Ysa and Nadyr, are split. Nadyr supports Abdullah out of principle. </p><p> <em>“Pashtuns didn’t like the Taliban people as well, although they were Pashtuns too. I support Abdullah, not because he is Pashtun, but because he plans for the future,”</em> he says. </p><p> He likes it that Abdullah participates in elections together with Mouhakkik who is Hazara. </p><p> <em>“He has always been a part of our society, he gets us. He has been our leader for a long time. I think Abdullah will win. Ghani’s deputy Sarwar Danesh is Hazara too. He is pro-Iranian, unlike Mouhakkik, who is not so pro-Iranian. But we just want him to help his people – that’s what matters.”</em> </p><p> He hopes Abdullah can make a good president because he is slightly against Pakistan and against the USA. </p><p> Ysa doesn’t agree. <em>“Ghani is very experienced. He is like Putin, who looks ahead.”</em> </p><p> And that’s when Ysa thinks about the flipside. </p><p> <em>“I once asked a politician, why Russia doesn’t supply its missiles to Iran or Syria. He said it’s a policy. Politicians are not trustworthy – today they think this way, the next day they change their mind. Sayyaf had an agreement with the Hazara too, but eventually they got no protection. So the policy is like that: today we are friends, tomorrow we are foes.”</em> </p><p> He has no doubt that Ghani is going to win in the second round of the elections. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“Do you think Ghani will bring another USA? It was already brought [to Afghanistan] 13 years ago,”</em> Nadyr argues. </p><p> <em>“The Americans spent $600 billion in Afghanistan so they will not let us go. They went there to prop up their positions against Russia, China and Central Asia. The US has plans in Afghanistan for 50 years ahead. They will leave at least 10,000 troops there for sure. Ghani appeals to them simply because he is pro-American,”</em> Nadyr says. </p><p> Many people in Afghanistan believe the Taliban has been created and imposed by the US too, and it was aimed at taking over the country. Nadyr and Ysa have no doubts about that. </p><p> <em>“Some of Ghani’s advisors speak out against the Hazara all the time. Moreover, his wife is not a Muslim, she’s from Lebanon,”</em> which, by the way, is a serious point in Afghanistan. </p><p> <em>“Russia came here with tanks, while the US came to Afghanistan with television and cash. It takes a long time for them, but eventually they get what they want. They set up a base here. People are against them and want them to leave, to which Americans respond, “OK, we are leaving.” But there are always those who ask them to stay,”</em> Nadyr says, meaning both candidates are willing to sign the agreement on further presence of the US troops. </p><p> <em>“They started the mess in Ukraine while being here and now make troubles in Dagestan. They aim at stirring up troubles in order to isolate Russia from the rest of the world. The Afghan people understand the essence of the US policy quite well now. But Americans also target the young people. There are some who think that since Americans brought television and the internet, they should stay,”</em> Ysa says, apparently not minding. He is among these young people. </p><p> <em>“Nothing happens the way we want,”</em> Ysa admits. And that’s true – nobody has asked the Afghan people in the last 35 years what they really want. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155272-ukraine-slovakia-reverse-gas/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukraine strikes 3.2 bcm reverse gas flow deal with Slovakia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155272-ukraine-slovakia-reverse-gas/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e8/80/00/ukraine_slovakia_reverse_gas_flow.jpg" title="Workers stand near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters/Gleb Garanich)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 13:18:44 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e8/80/00/ukraine_slovakia_reverse_gas_flow.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Energy-pinched Ukraine has reached a deal to start reverse gas flows from Central European neighbors via an unused pipeline to Slovakia.

The European Commission said the cooperation between Slovakia and Ukraine is a <em>“win-win for both parties”</em>. </p><p> <em>“It shows the EU's strong commitment in support of Ukraine's energy sector, which is also reflected in the economic and financial package the Union has swiftly provided for Ukraine in the past weeks. I would like to thank Energy Commissioner Oettinger and his team, who played a central role in paving the way for today’s agreement,”</em> Jose Barroso, President of the European Commission, who attended the ceremony, said in a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-487_en.htm" target="_blank">statement</a>. </p><p> By next spring, deliveries from Vojany, Slovakia to the western Ukrainian city of Uzhorod could reach 10 billion cubic meters, the amount European Commissioner for Energy Gunter Oettinger requested. </p><p> Deliveries from Slovakia could satisfy up to 20 percent of Ukraine’s natural gas demand, which in 2013 was 55 billion cubic meters. </p><p> In April, German energy company RWE <a href="http://rt.com/business/germany-rwe-gas-ukraine-656/" target="_blank">started</a> delivering gas to Ukraine using reverse flow through Poland. The gas is being supplied under a 2012 contract where RWE can deliver up to 10 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine per year. </p><p> Between these two deals alone, Ukraine has upped its supply from Europe ten-fold. Last year Ukraine imported around 2 billion cubic meters of gas from EU member states. </p><p> Ukraine imports nearly 50 percent of its natural gas from Russia, a country it now finds itself at diplomatic ends with, as it moves towards possible EU integration. In 2013, the country bought 27.7 billion meters, from Gazprom, Russia’s largest state-owned natural gas producer. </p><p> Ukraine presidential candidate Peter Poroshenko has said that by 2015, Ukraine will stop buying Russian gas. More neighbors may be tapped to start supplying gas to Ukraine, perhaps Poland or Hungary. </p><p> The deal is a short-term solution for Ukraine, which can no longer afford Russian gas after Moscow cancelled all gas discounts for Kiev, as it waits for Ukraine to repay an overdue gas bill of $2.2 billion. </p><p> Ukraine’s Energy Ministry was hoping to unlock more gas imports from its European neighbors, but Slovakian authorities must be careful not avoid any legal issues with Gazprom, </p><p> Currently Ukraine needs to pay $485 per thousand cubic meters for Russian gas, which compares to $268.5 agreed between Russia and Ukraine in December. </p><p> Ukraine currently has a “take-and-pay” contract with Gazprom which it is required to buy 41.6 billion cubic meters of gas in order to receive discount prices. In 2013, Ukraine only bough 12.9 billion cubic meters of gas, which prompted Gazprom last week to send Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state oil and gas company, a bill for $11.4 billion. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/155344-russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor/</guid><title><![CDATA[Prosecutor General seeks tougher punishment for corruption]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/155344-russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/00/00/russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor.jpg" title="Yury Chaika, Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation (RIA Novosti/Vladimir Astapkovich)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:55:17 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ed/00/00/russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Top Russian Prosecutor has proposed a bill making a prison sentence the only punishment for anyone convicted of corruption. It is in line with President Vladimir Putin’s observation that the 2011 softening of anti-corruption laws was not working.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/00/00/russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Yury Chaika, Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation (RIA Novosti/Vladimir Astapkovich)" /> <p> Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika addressed the upper house session on Monday and said that compensatory punishment or fines were not acting as a deterrent – one of the key points that provide the rule of law. </p><p> “<em>In order to rule out the possibility of bailing oneself out of a serious crime, like a corruption-related crime, by just paying a simple fine, a bill has been prepared that provides for only prison time for grave crimes, including corruption</em>,” the prosecutor told the lawmakers. </p><p> The current laws allowing <a href="http://rt.com/politics/medvedev-recommends-fines-bribery/" target="_blank">fines for bribery</a>, both in state administration and in private businesses, were introduced in 2011 under then-president Dmitry Medvedev as part of a campaign aimed at boosting entrepreneurship and improving the business climate in the country. Russian law enforcers opposed the move from the moment it was first suggested and prosecutors warned that the changes could simply lead to increases in bribes as criminals would seek compensation for future punishment. </p><p> However, in Autumn 2013 President Putin criticized the changes in his <a href="http://rt.com/politics/putin-corruption-tolerance-zero-965/" target="_blank">speech</a> before the Anti-Corruption Council – a special body of top law enforcers and state officials. </p><p> “<em>The practice shows us that the liberalization is not working the way it should</em>,” Putin said. According to the president, 692 people were convicted for taking bribes in the first half of 2013 and only 8 percent of them were sentenced to prison time, while the majority got away with fines that the criminals managed not to pay by using various loopholes. </p><p> Putin then told the council members that he expected them to submit particular suggestions on fighting corruption, suggesting to start with the area of communal services, consumer market and various government tenders. </p><p> Putin also urged the officials to make anti-graft standards universally accepted. He added that society and business had the right to demand the state strictly observed all anti-corruption laws, but should not act as indifferent observers. Moreover, quite often citizens were pushing civil servants towards violations in pursuit of their own business interests. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155348-us-administration-failure-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA['Obama and Kerry fail to show leadership qualities required to settle Ukrainian issue']]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155348-us-administration-failure-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/40/00/us-administration-failure-ukraine.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:33:26 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/40/00/us-administration-failure-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The US had set their eyes on the idea to make Ukraine the 29th EU state or perhaps even the 52nd US state, though it doesn’t have any clear scenario and simply continues "blamestorming" Russia, global financial markets expert Patrick Young told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/40/00/us-administration-failure-ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>President Obama says Russia's done nothing to meet its Geneva pledges. However, it’s likely to be more applicable to the US itself. Why is Washington acting like this?</em> </p><p> <strong>Patrick Young:</strong> I think the State Department is probably under great stress at the moment. Of course we’ve seen President Obama, in the course of the last three or four days, doing shuttle diplomacy through South-East Asia. This was supposed to be an incredible ceremonial tour where he would sign multiple free trade agreements, including with Japan. Instead he ended up to play football with robots in Tokyo instead. Why? Because ultimately his trade agenda is failing as it goes along. Therefore, given the pureness of the overall quality of the negotiation of the US, it’s hardly surprising that they are trying to do anything to take away the news. And therefore, we see Mr. Obama once again being a puppet ministered by the neo-cons that are still behind him, as an administration who simply see everything as being bad in Russia. It’s quite clear from what Mr. Lavrov has said, and has been saying, that he is trying everything to encourage people to disarm and therefore, active attempts to try to diffuse the Ukrainian situation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What is the American policy aimed at? Does the United States actually want the two sides in Ukraine to reach a deal?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> I think it’s very worrying because certainly the US seems to have had a remarkable transition in Ukraine. It seemed to be absolutely fine when you wanted to mount barricades in Maidan and they were the people who got the likes of John McCain to speak to them. Not only we’ve got this very fractured situation in Eastern Ukraine about which the Russians had previously warned us. Ultimately we have got a singular failure of diplomacy but particularly from the Western side at the moment. And of course what is happening, President Obama is rushing off to this mantra of claiming that he wants even greater sanctions. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What does the United States expect of Russia, then? It can't send in its military to disarm the pro-Russian protesters in Ukraine. It's asked them to disarm, what more can it do?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> Personally I’m confused because let’s put it another way. If Russia sent in troops to forcibly disarm the people who are holding the buildings, then America would claim they are invading. I really don’t know. The American picture is not clear. The Foreign Secretary Mr. Kerry perennially, as we know from his election campaign for president, has always worn a peppermint T-shirt and a full bag of coffee when he is at the diner. Ultimately it’s a huge problem in this environment at the moment. I don’t think America knows what it wants because ultimately America had set their eyes on the idea Ukraine is going to be something like the 29th state of the EU or perhaps even the 52nd state of the US. None of those were ever going to come to pass, the money is not there from the US and Europe to support whether it’s the rump Ukraine or whichever part of Ukraine it is. It’s confusing. America is not clear and simply <em>"blamestorming"</em> Russia is not going to help the situation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Neither Kiev nor the protesters seem to have stuck to the Geneva accord. Are they each waiting for the other side to act first?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> The problem we have here is a huge loss of faith on all parts. America clearly doesn’t trust Russia, at the same time there is a huge number of people on the ground in Ukraine who’ve been simply left behind. We are not talking about particularly the Eastern Ukrainians who have actually invaded these buildings, those occupying groups are one thing. But actually let’s face it: Ukraine is being run by a non-democratically appointed government that seems to have the blessing of the US. It’s not democratic, there are democratic elections supposedly taking place at the moment but as we can see, all the great powers are in there trying to shuffle things for their influence. It looks very 19th century in the way the things are going on at the moment. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why can’t the sides of the conflict reach any compromise? Or why the US doesn’t want to negotiate with Russia at least?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> Unfortunately, it is very difficult and this is a situation because after all as we know President Yanukovich, who was deeply flawed in his ability to govern, but was nonetheless the democratically elected president, ultimately had to flee the day after we had a group of Western politicians telling us that they had come to a wondrous solution in Kiev. Therefore, when there are challenges over the whole issue, it really requires leadership and statesmanship. The terrible problem is that Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry repeatedly fail to have those abilities that they demonstrate. Let’s put it another way. Today we are celebrating in Poland the canonization of Pope John Paul II, there is leader and he stood on the world stage at the time we had Mrs. Thatcher, Ronald Reagan – they may have been the absolute enemies of the old Soviet system but they were people who could do business with and did business with Mr. Gorbachev at the time. That’s the total change that we have in this situation, we have a series of political pygmies throughout the West, none of whom really realize that their word must be their bond. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/</guid><title><![CDATA[Obama rolls out new sanctions on Russia, Moscow says it won't hurt]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/40/00/obama-sanctions-putin-calculus.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama talks during a joint news conference at the Malacanang Palace in Manila, April 28, 2014.

Many Europeans oppose anti-Russian sanctions, which would target the economy as opposed to individuals close to the Russian leadership, since economic sanctions would hurt European economies as well as that of Russia. The US, being economically tied with Russia to a much lesser degree than Europe, says it would not impose economic sanctions <a href="http://rt.com/news/155168-us-eu-sanctions-russia/" target="_blank">unilaterally</a>. </p><p> <em>“I would be very surprised if all European countries found a common position on economic sanctions,”</em> Thierry Mariani, a member of the French National Assembly, told RT. <em>“When one country says ‘we don’t speak about finance’… and some other country says ‘we don’t speak about energy,’ then we don’t speak about anything. That’s why we arrive unfortunately [at] personal sanctions, which are completely nonsense.”</em> </p><p> The Russian leadership has thus far brushed off the threat of sanctions as ineffectual, arguing they might in fact buoy the Russian economy in the long term. </p><p> <em>“Overreliance can lead to a loss of sovereignty,”</em> Russian President <a href="http://rt.com/business/154576-sanctions-not-effective-putin/" target="_blank">Vladimir Putin said</a> at a media forum in St Petersburg on Thursday. </p><p> Western-led sanctions have several advantages for Russia, Putin said. </p><p> Putin said the threat of real economic sanctions is already bolstering domestic businesses, bringing more offshore funds back to Russia, and giving policymakers the push they need to establish a domestic payment system. </p><p> His comments <a href="http://rt.com/business/154012-sanctions-russia-stronger-medvedev/" target="_blank">echo sentiments</a> made by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev last week, who similarly argued that further sanctions would only make Russia stronger. </p><p> <em>“Thanks to Western sanctions, Russia has been given the incentive to reduce its dependence on outside and instead regional economies are being more self-sufficient,"</em> Medvedev said April 22. </p><p> Medvedev said any restrictions on Russian goods to the EU or US would serve to redirect Russian exports to Asian markets, which are more robust. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155352-putin-ukraine-defense-industry/</guid><title><![CDATA[End of defense imports to Russia would be catastrophe for Ukraine – Putin]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155352-putin-ukraine-defense-industry/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/80/00/putin-ukraine-defense-industry.jpg" title="Russian President Vladimir Putin (RIA Novosti/Alexei Druzhinin)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:56:29 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ed/80/00/putin-ukraine-defense-industry.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The end of defense industry cooperation between Kiev and Moscow due to the political crisis in Ukraine would lead the latter to a catastrophe, while Russia would be able to replace what it imports, President Putin has said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/80/00/putin-ukraine-defense-industry.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin (RIA Novosti/Alexei Druzhinin)" /> <p> <em>“Financially and technically Russia is able to conduct import substitution,”</em> Putin has said, adding that it won't require substantial funding. And this <em>“would not require a revision of the state defense order.”</em> </p><p> He estimated the whole process of import substitution for Russia would take between 1.5 and 2.5 years, depending on the type of the products. </p><p> <em>“But for the Ukrainian defense industry, the severing of ties with Russian partners is likely to lead to disaster,”</em> Putin said, speaking to the members of the Council of Lawmakers. <em>“Why? They don’t have any other markets. They just don’t exist. The only consumer is the Russian Armed Forces.”</em> </p><p> However, he expressed hope that <em>“rupture of these cooperation relations”</em> will not happen. </p><p> Still, Putin said he believes that such a halt to supplies is not a decision made <em>“directly by enterprises.”</em> </p><p> <em>"They [managers of these enterprises] understand perfectly in which situation Ukrainian government puts them. I’m sure, they would like to continue this cooperation,”</em> he said. </p><p> Earlier, Ukrainian First Vice-President Vitaly Yarema stated that the coup-appointed Ukrainian government had agreed to halt exports of weapons and military equipment to Russia. At the same time, he confirmed that deliveries of double-purpose (military and civil) products still continue. </p><p> Speaking of sanctions that the West is considering imposing on Russian industry sectors, and particularly the country’s military industrial complex, Putin stated that the measure, if taken, could be an attempt to prevent Russia from defense import substitution. </p><p> But, he said, <em>“This is an attempt with a bad means.”</em> </p><p> <em>“We will do that anyway,”</em> Putin emphasized. </p><p> Putin said that he has already ordered Russia’s government to examine the question of import substitution of the military-industrial complex’s products coming from Ukraine. </p><p> <em>“In any case, we are working on this now, I gave such an order to the government of the Russian Federation and they are actively working on it. [We are] studying all the issues related to import substitution,”</em> he said. </p><p> Russia will welcome specialists in the military-industrial complex from Ukraine, Putin said, vowing financial support to provide them with all necessities. </p><p> <em>“They will receive a worthy salary, and accommodation. [The regions] will receive all necessary means from the federal budget,"</em> Putin said. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155256-asian-economic-outlook-imf/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Japan and China threaten Asian economic growth - IMF]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155256-asian-economic-outlook-imf/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e7/80/00/asiat-economic-outlook-imf.jpg" title="Reuters/Toru Hanai"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:01:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e7/80/00/asiat-economic-outlook-imf.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Asian growth will remain steady at 5.4 percent in 2014, however a steeper than expected slowdown in China and a failure in Japan’s "Abenomics" program could derail the region’s economic progress, says the IMF.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e7/80/00/asiat-economic-outlook-imf.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Toru Hanai" /> <p> Asia also faces risks from outside the region, including improving growth in the US, which could raise global interest rates the new IMF <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2014/apd/eng/areo0414.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> said. </p><p> "<em>Bouts of capital flow and asset price volatility are likely along the way, with exchange rates, equity prices, and government bond yields affected by changes in global risk aversion and capital flows,</em>" the IMF concludes. </p><p> The IMF raised its growth forecast for Asia this year due to a pickup in external demand alongside a recovery in advanced economies. Growth is also expected to improve slightly to 5.5 percent in 2015. Last year, the region grew 5.2 percent. </p><p> However, the IMF predicts China will slowly decelerate to growth of 7.5 percent this year and 7.3 percent in 2015,to a "<em>more sustainable path</em>". </p><p> 2014 has been a <a href="http://rt.com/business/world-bank-china-growth-873/" target="_blank">bumpy start</a> for China, due to financial sector vulnerabilities, and the temporary cost of reforms, along with the transition toward a more sustainable growth path would have significant adverse regional spillover. </p><p> Domestic and global political tensions could also create trade disruptions and weaken investment and growth across the region. In some frontier economies, high credit growth has led to rising external and domestic vulnerabilities. </p><p> The IMF expects Japan's growth to decrease to 1 percent in 2015 from 1.4 percent this year, due to a reduction in the stimulus effects from monetary and fiscal easing. Another barrier towards growth will be a need to reduce debt, the outlook said. </p><p> Abenomics is Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s plan to stoke the economy and spur growth after decades of decline, with a commitment to keep the yen weak. </p><p> Meanwhile, the IMF says a pickup in external demand coupled with a recovery in advanced economies and resilient domestic demand should contribute to growth across most of the region. </p><p> "<em>The advanced economies are turning a corner and many Asian economies which depend on exports as a main growth engine are in a good position to capitalize on the recovery.

" /> <p> Somehow the bullets and missiles that could still be used end up in a pile slated for destruction, and because a single weapons arsenal database has still not been worked out, an estimated $1.2 billion pile of ammo will go down the drain. So says a Government Accountability Office report obtained by USA Today. </p><p> The development of the database has been in the works for years, but different services have their own information systems, which to this day can’t share that information directly. The only department that has adopted a new system by the Pentagon is the Army. The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps are all using outdated ones. </p><p> Democrat Senator and Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tom Carper told USA Today that <em>“there is a huge opportunity to save millions, if not billions of dollars if the [Pentagon] can make some common-sense improvements to how it manages ammunition.”</em> </p><p> The senator added that <em>“despite years of effort, the Army, Navy and Air Force still don't have an efficient process for doing something as basic as sharing excess bullets. This Government Accountability Office (GAO) report clearly shows that our military's antiquated systems lead to millions of dollars in wasteful ammunition purchases.”</em> </p><p> The Pentagon has agreed that a need to automate the inventory reporting system should take center stage in future budgets. Although the study only covers peace-time arsenal accounting, one anonymous top military officer noted in an interview with USA Today that there were frequent shortages of 9mm handgun and .50-caliber machine gun ammo in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p><p> Among other things, the GAO report has found that even after annual meetings between the various military services, which attempt to redistribute the unused stockpile by sharing surplus data, ammunition that didn’t get discussed automatically gets the axe and is added to the pile for destruction. By comparison to the $1 billion wasted, the $70 million saved appears negligible. </p><p> To put things into perspective, the Army’s missile stockpile alone comprises $14 billion of the Department of Defense’s total of $70 billion in ammo under management. </p><p> A number of other shortfalls, such as that the Army only last year began to report on its unused missiles, adds greatly to the billion-dollar waste. The Army’s choice not to report on a bulk of its surplus ammunition results in other services buying fresh. Its reporting fails to mention ammo left over and stored from previous years. As authors point out, the study was on the eve of being released when other potential sources of bad information emerged. So those losses will not have been included. </p><p> Furthermore, tedious bureaucratic measures to do with sharing procedures result in computer orders for ammo made to the Army having to be entered into the system manually, raising the risk of clerical error. </p><p> In sum, the report appears to place much of the blame on the Army brushing everyone away with claims that they don’t have enough surplus ammo left over for redistribution annually. But without the Army’s active participation in this, <em>“other services [spend] additional funds to procure missiles that are already unused and usable in the Army’s stockpile.”</em> </p><p> The Army, following Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s and the GAO’s recommendations, has promised to do better and has already begun increasingly to share surplus ammo information with other services starting March. Previously, the service had not been contributing to the annual report at all. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155308-constitution-police-cellphones-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[Warrantless cellphone searches get hearing in Supreme Court]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155308-constitution-police-cellphones-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.jpg" title="Reuters/Gary Cameron"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:01:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Supreme Court will hear two cases – one involving a suspected drug dealer, the other a gang member – to determine the legality of police searching cellphones without a warrant at the time of an arrest.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Gary Cameron" /> <p> The landmark cases pit the Obama administration, still reeling from whistleblower Edward Snowden’s NSA revelations, against civil rights advocates who say police are conducting illegal search and seizures. <br><br> In the digital age, when about 90 percent of US citizens own cellphones and 58 percent have a smart phone, a legal battle is raging behind the scenes as to whether cellphones should be protected under the Fourth Amendment, which forbids <em>“unreasonable searches and seizures.”</em> Or should the technology become fair game for the police following an arrest? <br><br> The question will be considered in the case of David Leon Riley (<em>Riley v California</em> 13-1312), who was pulled over in San Diego in 2009 for driving with an expired license. After discovering guns in his car, the police found evidence on Riley’s Samsung smart phone that got him convicted on attempted murder charges. <br><br> The state of California rejected efforts by Riley’s attorney to toss out the use of the digital evidence. <br><br> In the other case (<em>United States v Wurie</em>, 13-212), Brima Wurie was arrested in Massachusetts for dealing drugs. Following a search of his cellphone’s call log, investigators found an address, where they discovered more illegal substances and a gun. Unlike the case of David Riley, Wurie had his sentence overturned when the court rejected the evidence retrieved from his phone. <br><br> Under the Fourth Amendment, police require a warrant based on <em>"probable cause"</em> before they can conduct a search. <br><br> In the past, the courts have granted police the authority to search the possessions of arrested individuals for two reasons: determining the individual is not carrying a weapon and preventing the destruction of evidence, like narcotics. <br><br> The question of cell phones, they argue, does not fit into either category. <br><br> Jeffrey Fisher, the lawyer for Riley, pointed to FBI statistics showing some 12 million Americans were arrested in 2012 alone, mostly over “minor crimes” like <em>"jaywalking, littering or riding a bicycle the wrong direction on a residential street,"</em> he said in his court filing. <br><br> It would be wrong, Fisher believes, that police would have the authority to search a person’s cellphone without first getting a court order to provide a warrant. </p><p> </p><p> <em>"The digital contents of a smart phone are categorically incapable of threatening officer safety. And once police have seized and secured a smart phone, there is no risk that the arrestee might destroy or alter its digital contents,"</em> Fisher continued. <br><br><em>"Such files hold exponentially greater amounts and types of sensitive personal information than any physical item."</em> <br><br> Civil rights watchdogs agree with that position. <br><br><em>"Cellphones and other portable electronic devices are, in effect, our new homes,"</em> the American Civil Liberties Union said in a court filing urging the Supreme Court to uphold the letter of the Fourth Amendment. <br><br> The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF argued on behalf of privacy, reminding that smart phones hold huge amounts of personal data. <br><br><em>"The breadth of that information would likely reveal an individual's medical history, religious beliefs, political affiliations, network of friends, colleagues, intimate associates, and acquaintances,"</em> as stated in a friend-of-the-court letter filed by EFF and others. <br><br> However, the Obama administration - and despite the criticism it received in the wake of the Snowden NSA leaks, which detailed a vast global surveillance system being used against friends and enemies alike - is in favor of granting police access to private data without a warrant. <br><br><em>"It is now common for drug deals to be arranged by cell phones, for violent street gangs to communicate through text messages, and for child abuse to be recorded on camera phones,"</em> the Justice Department stated in its court filings. <em>"In today's world, cell phones are particularly likely to contain evidence of unlawful activity and to help law-enforcement officers identify suspects they have apprehended."</em> <br><br> According to this argument, cellphones are no different from anything other possession a person may be carrying when arrested. <br><br><em>"Cellphones are now critical tools in the commission of crimes,"</em> said Donald Verrilli Jr., the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, AP reported. <br><br> Officials, however, are urging caution in coming to any quick conclusions in the case because the <em>“technology is changing rapidly,”</em> Attorney General of California Kamala Harris said in her court filing. <br><br> The court is expected to arrive at its conclusion in the cases by late June. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155320-kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Mayor of Kharkov, Ukraine shot in back, hospitalized - press service]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155320-kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/80/00/kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine.jpg" title="Kharkov Mayor Gennady Kernes (RIA Novosti/Chekachkov Igor)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:32:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/eb/80/00/kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov, Gennady Kernes, has been shot in the back, the city council’s press service reports.

His lung is pierced and his liver pierced all the way through.”</em> </p><p> The mayor was taken to the local hospital at about 11:30 am (8:30 GMT) local time. </p><p> Following an operation that lasted two hours, Valery Boyko, the surgeon who was treating Kernes, called his condition serious as his diaphragm had been injured. He also said that his interior organs have been damaged and he will remain in serious condition for at least several days. </p><p> Boyko said that the doctors had stopped the bleeding, but that Kernes is currently unconscious. </p><p> <em>“The operation was performed successfully. Now we rely on God and wish strength to Gennady Kernes,”</em> he added. </p><p> Meanwhile, Sidorenko, of mayor’s press service, declined to comment about who was behind the shooting. He only told RT that Kernes <em>“has been recently receiving a lot of threats from various people.”</em> </p><p> A shell <em>“allegedly from sniper rifle”</em> was found at the site where the mayor was shot, Irina Kushchenko, from the public relations department of the city’s Executive Committee. </p><p> Party of Regions presidential candidate Mikhail Dobkin, a close friend of Kernes, said the gunman used live fire. According to Dobkin, there was a 7.62 mm shell from a Dragunov sniper rifle. </p><p> </p><p> A mayor of Kharkov since March 2010, Kernes had been a strong supporter of President Viktor Yanukovich right till his ouster in February. Since then he supported the new Ukrainian authorities and kept his position. </p><p> The shooting comes a day after ultranationalists clashed with anti-government protesters in the city, leaving 14 people injured. </p><p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/puG2Wn6wJA4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p><p> Meanwhile, Ukrainian presidential candidate Oleg Tsarev condemned the attack on the Kharkov mayor. He said that despite his and Kernes’ political rivalry, the attack outraged him. </p><p> <em>“Shooting at the politicians is wrong. Once again it shows that it is impossible to hold presidential elections until we reach consensus and civil peace,”</em> he added. </p><p> Kharkov mayor and Party of Regions member Gennady Kernes was born June 27, 1959, in Kharkov, then in the Ukrainian SSR. He is a lawyer and manager by profession. </p><p> A miner in the late 70s, Kernes became engaged in politics in 1998, when he ran for the Kharkov City Council. </p><p> In 2004, Kernes was an enthusiastic supporter of the Orange Revolution. Political alliances secured him the mayor’s post on October 31, 2010, after Mikhail Dobkin had become head of the regional state administration. The results, which were overwhelmingly in his favor again, were controversial and came under suspicion from critics. During his tenure as mayor, he has become well known among locals for his far-reaching city reforms and his contributions to development and charitable causes. </p><p> However, Kernes’s past is also entangled with Ukraine’s underworld – among other things, he was allegedly the boss of his own criminal organization, which gained notoriety in the region. He was also convicted of theft and fraud. </p><p> Since the February 2014 coup in Ukraine, he has been accused of fomenting separatism. In January, he gave himself a controversial 25 percent pay rise. </p><p> Kernes was awarded many political honors in his time. He is a father of three children. His hobbies, among other things, include actively promoting and leading a healthy lifestyle. </p><p> Thousands of anti-government demonstrations have swept eastern Ukraine since March, with administration buildings being seized in several cities, including Kharkov, the largest city. </p><p> At the beginning of March some 111 people were injured in clashes between anti-government protesters and radical nationalists in the city after the radical groups then seized the administration building. Commenting on the incident, Mayor Kernes said they were ultra nationalist elements <em>“who hid their faces behind masks and had weapons, including automatic ones,”</em> adding that <em>“it turned out that these men came from western Ukraine – from Lvov, Ivano-Frankovsk.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155300-gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Russia not obliged to finance Ukraine-EU integration’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155300-gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/40/00/gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu.jpg" title="A worker stands near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:19:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/40/00/gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Since the moment Ukraine chose to become an independent state, it has had to accept that it can’t develop as a country at the cost of Russian taxpayers, Anna Van Densky, political commentator from the EU Reporter Magazine, told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/40/00/gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A worker stands near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters)" /> <p> Speaking about Russian gas, Van Densky said that Europe needs it badly for its development, while this commodity is taken hostage because of the political contradictions and ambitions over Ukrainian crisis. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> H<em>as the gas supply to Europe ever been as threatened as it is now?</em> </p><p> <strong>Anna Van Densky:</strong> It has always been a problem like that because after the collapse of the Soviet Union it was very difficult for the Ukrainian leadership to come to the terms that independence has its own price and if Ukraine is an independent state. They have to pay for gas as for any other commodity. Now of course it’s not the first so-called gas war because, unfortunately, gas transit was used on many occasions as an instrument of political pressure. </p><p> That what we see now, because now the supplies to Europe are also threatened, that’s why the South Stream corridor is so crucial to stabilize gas supplies to Europeans, because we had the situation with crisis in 2006, 2009. It’s a system that should be really reconstructed, rebuilt in another way, and that’s why it’s ideal for Ukrainians themselves also to have different view on the energy so that they could also open a broad gate to green energy, for example, alternative energy, wind energy, etc. So this dependency on transit of Russian gas is also unhealthy for the Ukrainian state, for Ukrainians, because unfortunately there were many parasites around this easy money. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Is South Stream pipeline really necessary? Surely it would be cheaper to work out a proper, long term deal with Ukraine? What do you think?</em> </p><p> <strong>AD:</strong> There are a lot of details that are very ambivalent. First of all, in any supplies it’s much better to have multiple ways than one way, so it’s not only for political reasons. There can be other reasons like a catastrophe. The problem of supply isn’t dependent on Ukrainians as such. [The] more routes, [the] more secure it is. That’s why you talk all the time about diversifying the ways of gas. South Stream is an ideal way because it goes from Russia through Black Sea and it comes to Bulgaria, it comes directly to the EU. So it’s one of the ways, it’s not about cutting gas, Russian gas, from [going] through Ukraine, it’s just diminishing this route and giving other alternative routes and opportunity. It’s also very fashionable because it will open real opportunities for the other alternative to Ukrainians, like green energy, for example. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> U<em>kraine still wants heavily discounted gas prices. Is that a fair request?</em> </p><p> <strong>AD:</strong> It’s not a fair request, no. It comes from the Soviet era, because once upon a time Soviet Union was basically one state. Asking for this price is absolutely ridiculous in the situation of being an independent state and buying a commodity. It’s a confusion and this confusion caused a lot of political problems afterwards as well, because the moment Ukraine or Ukrainian people chose to become an independent state, they had to accept that they can’t develop their country on cost of Russian taxpayers, because they are the citizens of other countries. That’s the way it goes. </p><p> So it’s a lot of political confusion now as well, because if Europeans would like to help Ukrainians they have to sit together with Russians at the negotiation table and find out the way to help them to pay their bills, because it would be very naïve to expect that Russian taxpayers are obliged to finance Ukrainian integration into the EU. </p><p> So it’s not the way the things work. Unfortunately, all the revolutions are very anti-democratic because now the decisions are in the hands of a very small group of people, they were not elected democratically. I personally hope that after the real democratic elections there will be new leaders who will accept a fair and modern-style relationship with Russia. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Isn't Russia's reputation as a reliable energy supplier is now a hostage to Kiev's political whims? Is there any solution?</em> </p><p> <strong>AD:</strong> The South Stream is an ideal solution basically because it goes from Russia through the Black Sea and to Europe. It will help Europe because European needs gas badly, for example, Italy wants to develop southern Italy, and it would be a great opportunity for the economies of the south to get Russian gas. Let’s not forget that gas remains the most ecological among all types of energy. So it’s good for Europe, it’s good for [the] economy and it’s very sad that such a commodity is taken hostage because of these political contradictions and ambitions. </p><p> It’s especially important to have South Stream corridor as a solution to diversify the ways of gas to Europe. The latest Ukrainian Maidan revolution is not the first one, there was also the Orange Revolution and the hope was flying high, but it didn’t deliver it and it ended in a second revolution, Maidan. When the situation will be stabilizing in Ukraine nobody really knows. We hope it will be stabilized soon. Anyway, I think that European and Russians, the taxpayers from both sides can’t be taken hostage of this political instability in Ukraine, so the South Stream and Nord Stream, maybe other pipeline like Yamal, will help to create real strategic partnership and well-being of the people. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/155292-russia-veterans-ombudsman-law/</guid><title><![CDATA[Leftist MP suggests establishing veterans’ ombudsman post]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/155292-russia-veterans-ombudsman-law/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e9/c0/00/russia-veterans-ombudsman-law.jpg" title="RIA Novosti/Evgeny Biyatov"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:16:05 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e9/c0/00/russia-veterans-ombudsman-law.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A Russian lawmaker holds that the country needs an official who would protect the veterans’ rights and help them cope with the rapidly changing laws and shifts in national economy.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e9/c0/00/russia-veterans-ombudsman-law.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="RIA Novosti/Evgeny Biyatov" /> <p> Oleg Mikheyev of the center-left Fair Russia party has addressed the government and the Public Chamber with a request to institute the post of plenipotentiary for veterans’ issues, or the veterans’ ombudsman, the RIA Novosti reported on Monday.

It managed to win enough votes in 2012 election to bring its candidate Morsi to power. </p><p> His government however failed to address acute economic and security problems that Egypt was facing, with protests continuing. A year after Morsi took the presidential oath, the Egyptian military staged a coup d'état and deposed him. The Muslim Brotherhood was subsequently outlawed again. </p><p> Former Egyptian army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is seeking presidency now in upcoming May election. Morsi supporters and members of Islamist political parties close to the Muslim Brotherhood are calling on a boycott of the poll. </p><p> Sisi, a strongman widely seen as the de facto ruler of Egypt, is trumpeted by his supporters as a figure that can stabilize the country in a time of crisis. There is little doubt that he will win the election, in which he has only one opponent: leftist Hamdeen Sabahi, who came third in the 2012 election. </p><h2> World’s Top 5 Executioners </h2><p> There were 778 recorded executions in 2013 worldwide, a jump of almost 15 percent on the previous year, with China, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United States topping the list, according to Amnesty International’s annual report for 2013. <br><br> 1. China: (it's a secret, but believed to be in the thousands) <br><br> The People’s Republic of China executed more people than any other country in 2013. Although the exact number is treated as classified state information, Amnesty International estimates that thousands are executed in the country of over 1 billion people every year, more than the rest of the world combined. <br><br> 2. Iran: 369 <br><br> Figures show an increase in executions of 18 percent on 2012. Amnesty said it had recorded "numerous cases" in which it appeared capital punishment had been used to counter protests by Iran's ethnic minorities. <br><br> 3. Iraq: 169 <br><br> Iraq’s executions figure is an increase of more than 30 percent compared to the previous year – the highest since 2003. Most death sentences in recent years are thought to have resulted from convictions under an anti-terror bill that covers acts such as <em>"provoking, planning, financing, committing or supporting others to commit terrorism."</em> <br><br> 4. Saudi Arabia: 79 <br><br> Strict observance of Sharia law has seen Saudi Arabia carry out 79 executions in central Riyadh, instead of privately executing criminals in prisons. It is one of the last five countries that still performs public executions, the other four being Iran, Syria, North Korea and Yemen. <br><br> 5. United States: 39 <br><br> The only country in the Americas that carried out executions last year.

(AFP Photo / Crown Copyright)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why this urgent need for Russian-speaking agents in British intelligence? <br></em> </p><p> <strong>Annie Machon:</strong> Well it is interesting timing, I think, because for the last 5 or 6 years British intelligence has said that one of the biggest threats is Russian espionage in London. But now I think we're looking into situation where obviously post Russia infringe in Syria, stopping an illegal rush to war by the West in Syria, post the Ukraine, post Crimea and also of course post Edward Snowden and giving him asylum last year – I think that is an indication that the West is ramping up its interventionism and its investigation into Russian activity in the West. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>You have said this all smacks of the Cold War. Are the latest tensions between Moscow and the West really that bad?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> One would hope not. After the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a huge rapprochement between the West and the East, and I remember the former head of MI5 Dame Stella Rimington went across and worked with and spoke with her counterpart in Russia in the early 1990s to share information, to share working methodologies because the end of the war had occurred. </p><p> So it's rather worrying that the UK is now ramping-up their perceived risk around what they are doing with the Russian espionage aspect. But it is a shame, because I think Europe should be working together, Europe should not be dividing itself in the way they are doing at the dictate of the US. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The job ad on MI5's website says, “Your work will enable us to take a well-informed view of potential threats to national security, including terrorism and espionage.” Does this mean the UK thinks such threats could come from Russia?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> Well that is a very good question, because the job of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, the three primary intelligence agencies in the UK is to defend national security and the economic well-being of the state. </p><p> Now, national security has never been legally defined under the UK law. So we have a situation where it can be abused, used, reinterpreted whatever the government, or the intelligence agencies or the British establishment want to choose to say is national security. </p><p> I would suggest that what the British need to do is take a step back and say: “What is our national security? What is the threat to it? Is it the integrity of our nation such as we faced in WWII with the potential Nazi invasion? And if that is the case, how do we best protect it, how do we best police it?” </p><p> And of course in Britain, we have a very British mess, where we have a 100 year cycle of British intelligence agencies evolving and taking on the work, and just been giving jobs for the boys. </p><p> So I think for Britain, it would be good if they can step back and say what is the threat, and how do we best protect ourselves and how then we can structure our intelligence response, rather than just say: “This week we are a bit worried about this, we are a bit worried about this threat this year.” It is just a reaction rather than a pro-active and creative response to the threat to our nation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>For this job, MI5 will only consider Brits who have lived in the UK for the past 9 years, and whose parents are also British. Whom are these requirements supposed to rule out?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> One of the requirement to work for the British intelligence agencies is that you have to be British by nationality, and also I think you have to have grandparents, at least two that are British as well. So they are trying to ensure that people have a certain tie to the country, I suppose. But in this day and age of multiculturalism and everything, it becomes extremely difficult to adhere to that. </p><p> And it is interesting as well looking back over the last century that people who have been deemed to be traitors by the UK, who have gone over to what used to be Soviet side, who were allowed to leave the country and not get prosecuted under the espionage act of the early 20th century, tended to be the establishment. So there seems to be one rule for the generals and one rule for the infantry. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Is it just a coincidence that the need for experts on Russia comes at a time when Europe and the US are blaming Moscow for the current unrest in Ukraine?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> Well I think it is a bit rich for the West to say Russia is trying ferment the resistance within eastern Ukraine, when it appears that the West and EU have been trying to ferment resistance in western Ukraine before the original revolution that deposed the president. </p><p> I also find it interesting that the US president is trying to lecture Russia and say that “we have to go by the democratic rules” and things like that. That is precisely what has happened in Crimea. That is precisely what has not happened in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, so these sort of double standards are very troubling. </p><p> Either we adhere to international law, democracy and the rules around this. And I think this was what was done in Crimea. That is I want to see done in most of the Middle East and North Africa and Central Asia, or we don't. And for America to lecture one way and do just the other thing on the other side is not acceptable. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155240-tornado-damage-injuries-states/</guid><title><![CDATA[Casualties, massive damage as multiple tornadoes rip through US]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155240-tornado-damage-injuries-states/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e6/80/00/tornado.jpg" title="A low-level thunderstorm supercell passes over the area of Hampton, Arkansas (Reuters / Gene Blevins)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:40:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e6/80/00/tornado.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A powerful tornado storm system has ripped through several US states, killing one person in Oklahoma and at least 16 others in central Arkansas while causing major damage in the Great Plains, Midwest and Southern states.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e6/80/00/tornado.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A low-level thunderstorm supercell passes over the area of Hampton, Arkansas (Reuters / Gene Blevins)" /> <p> A tornado killed one person in Quapaw, a small residence in Oklahoma, on the border of Kansas and Missouri, authorities announced, saying the storm struck the town around 5:30pm local time. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> My hometown sustained a direct <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tornado&amp;src=hash">#tornado</a> hit.

The event was also shown in 3D at hundreds of cinemas across the world and was tweeted live by the Vatican's vicariate of Rome under the hashtag #2popesaints. <br><br><em>"We are followers of all four popes who have all been close to the people. This is an historic day but one that you really feel inside,"</em> Luisa Tomolo, a member of an Italian religious movement, told AP. <br><br> The crowd was nearly half kilometer-long as it stretched back along all of Via della Conciliazione, boulevard in the center of Rome. One of the pilgrims was holding a banner saying "Two pope saints in heaven, two in St Peter's Square". </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Foto del día: momento en que <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Benedicto&amp;src=hash">#Benedicto</a> XVI llega a plaza san Pedro para misa de canonizaciones <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%232popesaints&amp;src=hash"> #2popesaints</a> <a href="http://t.co/VeEBNZvzsH">pic.twitter.com/VeEBNZvzsH</a> </p> <p> — JorgeEnriqueMújicaLC (@web_pastor) <a href="https://twitter.com/web_pastor/statuses/460335630296174592">April 27, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> </p><p> Meanwhile, some people waited for more than 12 hours along the main street before police opened up St Peter's Square at 05:30 a.m. local time (04:30 GMT). <br><br> Many world leaders also arrived to commemorate two prominent figures of Catholic Church. <br><br> According to Vatican’s press service, at least 98 foreign delegations attended the ceremony. <br><br> High levels of security were reported.

The acceleration of his sainthood, the fastest since the 18th century, was also considered controversial. <br><br> Another canonized Pope, John XXIII, an Italian, known as the <em>“Good Pope”</em> due to his friendly character is famous for launching a process of reform of the Catholic Church in 1962. An advocate for human rights, he often expressed his views on equality saying <em>“We were all made in God's image, and thus, we are all Godly alike.”</em> <br><br> As an Apostolic Nuncio to France (envoy from the Roman Catholic Church), John XXIII saved thousands of Jews during World War II. <br><br><em>“I feel very happy because both of them inspire us,”</em> Father Emmanuel Emeka, a priest from Nigeria, told Reuters. <em>“I think both of them have a lot to teach us.”</em> </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> La Chiesa di Dio, sotto il cielo di Roma! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%232popesaints&amp;src=hash">#2popesaints</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SanGiovanniPaoloII&amp;src=hash"> #SanGiovanniPaoloII</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sangiovannixxiii&amp;src=hash"> #sangiovannixxiii</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PapaFrancesco&amp;src=hash">#PapaFrancesco</a><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Roma&amp;src=hash">#Roma</a><a href="http://t.co/XwoYwx3dn0">pic.twitter.com/XwoYwx3dn0</a> </p> <p> — Sabrina (@Sabrinat_witter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sabrinat_witter/statuses/460363044854710272"> April 27, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Los obispos se van, yo también.

(Reuters / Amer Alfaj) " /> <p> Over 92 percent of Syria's chemical stockpile has been removed from the country, Sigrid Kaag head of the combined Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-UN task team told a news conference at the Damascus-based Four Seasons Hotel on Sunday. </p><p> <em>"(Also) a total of 18 removal operations have been carried out ...and always with due regard for the environment and public safety,"</em> she added. <br><br> In addition to the removal, Damascus has destroyed buildings, equipment, empty mustard gas containers, and decontaminated other containers at several chemical weapons storage and production sites. <br><br><em>“We are talking basically of the remaining seven and a half, eight percent of chemicals weapons material that currently still in country in one particular site. Six and a half, roughly, needs to be removed, a small percentage is to be destroyed regardless in country that can be done,"</em> she said. <br><br> The watchdog added that the Syrian government has been very cooperative after joining the Chemical Weapons Convention, however it needs to <em>"acquit itself of its commitments"</em> and ensure the remaining materials are eradicated by the end of the month. <br><br><em>“It's important that the last push is made toward full completion,''</em> Kaag said. <br><br> Damascus pledged to remove all chemicals by April 13, except for those in areas <em>“that are presently inaccessible,”</em> by an April-27 deadline, according to the OPCW. So far the deadlines have not been met, because of the unstable situation inside the country. </p><p> </p><p> Kaag said on Sunday that the joint OPCW-UN mission has been receiving information from Damascus about attacks on convoys transferring weapons, Syrian SANA news agency reported. <br><br><em>“Syria is a country at war. The security situation is volatile, precarious and it shifts all the time,”</em> Kagg told RT adding that security remains always a challenge and the situation should be addressed <em>“to avoid the risk of any of the chemical weapons materials falling in the wrong hands”. <br></em> <br> Kaag said the mission has not yet been given access to 12 chemical weapons production facilities. These facilities are under review by the OPCW Executive Council regarding the modalities for their destruction. <br><br> In March Russia urged the provision of security of chemical weapons transportation pointing to the March 9 attack on the port at Latakia. The chemicals are being transported there and loaded onto Norwegian and Danish ships for transport to the Italian port Gioia Tauro. There the weapons will be transferred to a ship and turned into low-toxicity effluent. <br><br><em>“Three rockets were fired towards the ships [transporting the weapons]”</em> in a <em>“purposeful act of sabotage”</em> that constitutes a “flagrant violation” of UN regulations, said a statement from the Russian foreign ministry. <br><br> In February, Damascus said there were two attempted attacks on convoys with chemical weapons. The OPCW inspectors have also been fired upon by snipers in autumn of 2013. Mortar bombs landed near their hotel in Damascus, however it was not clear whether they had been targeted. <br><br> Moscow stressed the Syrian government cannot take all responsibility for chemical weapons removal. <br><br> Syria agreed to the destruction of its chemical weapons through a US-Russia brokered deal in September. The decision was sparked by a deadly sarin gas attack in August 21 near Damascus that killed hundreds of people. The West blamed President Bashar Assad forces for it, while Damascus accused the rebels. <br><br> Syria has declared around 700 tons of the most-dangerous chemicals, 500 tons of less-dangerous precursor chemicals and 122 tons of isopropanol used in sarin gas production. The deadline for the mission’s completion is June 30. Kaag told reporters in Damascus on Sunday that the UN hoped Syria would meet it. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155208-mars-water-flowing-space/</guid><title><![CDATA[Water was flowing on Mars 200,000 years ago – scientists]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155208-mars-water-flowing-space/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e4/80/00/mars-20090529-browse.jpg" title="Photo Credit: NASA"/><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 18:11:28 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e4/80/00/mars-20090529-browse.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />New research has suggested that water was flowing across the surface of Mars some 200,000 years ago.

However, the young age of the crater means the features signifying water must have appeared since. <br><br> The scientists drew comparisons between the geomorphological land formations and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. The crater had features of areas on earth where debris flow had caused material to be deposited by fast-flowing water. <br><br><em>“Our fieldwork on Svalbard confirmed our interpretation of the Martian deposits,”</em> stated Andreas Johnsson, a spokesperson for the research team. <br><br><em>“Our study crater on Mars is far too young to have been influenced by the conditions that were prevalent then. This suggests that the meltwater-related processes that formed these deposits have been exceptionally effective also in more recent times,”</em> said Johnsson. <br><br><em>“If we find on Mars evidence for a second genesis, that changes everything,”</em> Johnsson added. <br><br> A debris flow takes place when liquid water soaks through debris lying on an incline to the point that it becomes saturated and heavy, causing it to descend down the incline. <br><br> On earth, debris flow can result in material destruction and sometimes casualties, depending upon their severity. <br><br> When the flow stops, new landforms are made, including lobate deposits and paired levees. It is these that Johnsson has identified on the planet. <br><br><em>“Gullies are common on Mars, but the ones which have been studied previously are older, and the sediments where they have formed are associated with the most recent ice age. Our study crater on Mars is far too young to have been influenced by the conditions that were prevalent then,”</em> Johnson said. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155204-ukraine-protesters-tv-station/</guid><title><![CDATA[Anti-govt protesters seize TV station in eastern Ukraine, call for own channel]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155204-ukraine-protesters-tv-station/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e4/40/00/000_par7864681.jpg" title="Activists stand guard outside a regional television station after it was seized by pro-Russian separatists, in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on April 27, 2014.

Itar-Tass reports that some Russian TV channels have resumed work in Donetsk. </p><p> <em>“Their experts are now setting up equipment on our frequency to broadcast Russian TV channels,”</em> TV station CEO Oleg Dzholos told Ukraine’s Channel 5, Interfax-Ukraine reported. </p><p> One of the protesters has told the news agency that “Russia 24” channel is already broadcasting instead of local “Channel 27”. </p><p> Protesters have left the building, but still left their security there. </p><p> <em>“Nobody freed the TV station – protesters left, but there is our security there as well as our technicians and the station’s crew,”</em> an unnamed man told Interfax-Ukraine. </p><p> </p><p> It has also been reported that pro-Russian protesters held talks with the TV center's executives to begin broadcasting the “Donetsk People's Republic” television channel. </p><p> <em>“There were many demands. First – switch off Ukrainian channels. I explained that we are Donetsk state TV and radio station and from our central control room, there is only our signal. There were experts and they understood me. The following demand was – not a demand, an ultimatum – to switch on, if I am not mistaken, Russia-24 TV channel,”</em> Dzholos said. </p><p> So far, all Ukrainian TV channels continue their broadcast. </p><p> Protesters entered the TV station late Sunday afternoon, saying they were unsatisfied with the way the situation in the region was covered in local news and shows. Protesters demanded that Ukrainian channels be blocked. </p><p> They have taken down the Ukrainian flag from the TV station’s office and hoisted the flag of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. It was also taken down later. </p><p> </p><p> Protesters brought satellite antennas and other equipment and placed guards at the entrance to the television center, Itar-Tass reported. </p><p> Prior to taking control of the TV station, over 3,000 people gathered at Donetsk's central Lenin Square. Protesters started the rally with one minute's silence to commemorate Berkut Special Forces officers killed in clashes with radicals in Kiev's Independence Square, and activists killed by Right Sector radicals at a checkpoint in Slavyansk on Easter Sunday. </p><p> Russian TV channels have been blocked across Ukraine since the beginning of March, after the Ukrainian media watchdog claimed that shutting down Russian TV stations ensured the country’s <em>“national security and sovereignty.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> At least five major Russian channels, including Vesti, Russia-24, Channel One’s international broadcasts, RTR ‘Planeta’ and NTV World were immediately excluded from the list of options by providers throughout Ukraine. </p><p> The move was strongly condemned by the OSCE, which <a href="http://rt.com/news/russian-tv-suspended-ukraine-242/" target="_blank">called</a> the move <em>“repressive”</em> and <em>“a form of censorship.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Since then, the situation in Donetsk has deteriorated, with people demanding a referendum on the region’s autonomy from Kiev. Amid massive protests, when a number of government building were stormed and seized by anti-government activists, Kiev launched an “anti-terrorist” military operation targeting rallying civilians. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155176-mers-spread-saudi-arabia/</guid><title><![CDATA[MERS spreading: Saudi Arabia registers 26 more cases after Egypt discovers first patient]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155176-mers-spread-saudi-arabia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e2/80/00/000_nic6315648.jpg" title="Saudi women leave the emergency department at a hospital in the center of the Saudi capital Riyadh.

(AFP Photo / Fayez Nurildine)" /> <p> On Friday, Saudi Arabia announced that it had discovered 14 more cases, meaning the total number of infected patients then stood at 313. On Sunday the country confirmed a further 26 cases, bringing the number to 323. </p><p> <br> On Sunday, eight more deaths were reported. One-hundred-and-two of all MERS cases in the country have so far been fatal. The death rate for the illness stands at approximately 40 percent, and since the beginning of April cases have spiked with a 65 percent jump – 143 cases have been announced this month alone. <br><br> On Saturday, a 27-year-old Egyptian man was discovered to have contracted the disease. He had recently returned from Saudi Arabia and is currently being treated at a Cairo hospital, and is reportedly in a stable condition. <br><br> Shortly after the case was reported, a WHO spokesman stated that it was <em>“concerned”</em> about the rising numbers of people suffering from the disease. <br><br> Last Tuesday, it was reported that Greece’s first confirmed MERS patient was in critical condition, according to doctors. The same day, Saudi Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabiah was sacked shortly after visiting a hospital in Jeddah – the main gateway to the Islamic holy city of Mecca, in the country’s west – which he was visiting in order to alleviate heightened public fear over the virus. Many Saudis have been expressing heightened concern on social media. </p><p> Three centers have now been set up by Saudi Arabia to deal with the outbreak of the disease. </p><p> <em>“This step comes as part of an emergency plan aiming to contain the spread of the virus,”</em> acting Health Minister Adel Faqih, said on Saturday, according to Saudi Press Agency. </p><p> The centers are reportedly located in the Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Hospital in Riyadh, King Abdullah Medical Complex in Jeddah, and Dammam Medical Complex in the Eastern Province, <br><br> MERS is a SARS-like disease which kills approximately one-third of people that become infected. There is currently no cure for it. <br><br> While the illness is compared to SARS, it is still in the process of being researched by experts. SARS exploded across Asia in 2003, infecting 8,273 people – nine percent of whom died. MERS is thought to be deadlier but more difficult to transmit. A February study suggested that camels are the major source of the disease, although previous studies said that it originated in bats. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155196-bahrain-police-killing-sentences/</guid><title><![CDATA[Bahrain hands down life sentences to 8 activists over policeman’s killing]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155196-bahrain-police-killing-sentences/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e3/c0/00/000_ts-nic6320929.jpg" title="A Bahraini protestor throws a tear gas canister back at riot police during clashes following a protest condemning the death of Ahmed Al-Mosajen and Ali Abbas, in the village of Al-Maqsha, west of Manama, on April 25, 2014.

The men were found guilty of planting a homemade bomb close to where police usually set up checkpoints during protests. They were then accused of setting tires ablaze and blocking the road to lure security forces to the area. </p><p> One policeman was killed and four others were wounded in the ensuing blast, the prosecutor said. </p><p> The men were also found guilty of illegally taking part in anti-government protests in the northern village of Dair in August 2013. </p><p> The defendants, however, said they had made their confessions under torture. </p><p> In late March, 13 Bahrainis, some of them teenagers, were also jailed for life after being found guilty of attempting to kill policemen by attacking their vehicle and for taking part in an illegal protest in the Shiite village of Bilad al-Qadeem, just outside the capital, Manama. </p><p> Last week, 26 Bahrainis were sentenced to 10 years in jail each after being convicted of attacking a police station with petrol bombs and iron rods in Sitra in Bahrain's northeast in April 2012.

Activists say the measures have not helped. </p><p> Bahrain has been beset by massive street demonstrations since 2011. The opposition has demanded the establishment of a constitutional government in the Shia-majority state, which is ruled by a Sunni monarchy. On the eve of the three-year anniversary of the Arab Spring-inspired protests this past February, Lese-majeste became a crime punishable by up to 7 years in prison. </p><p> The US has been reluctant to criticize the small island country, which hosts its strategically vital Fifth Fleet. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155200-mi5-hiring-russian-experts/</guid><title><![CDATA[MI5 hiring: British Secret Service looking for intel experts on Russia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155200-mi5-hiring-russian-experts/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e4/00/00/rtrdluo.jpg" title="The MI5 headquarters in central London (Reuters / David Bebber)"/><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e4/00/00/rtrdluo.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK’s MI5 has decided to beef up its team with more experts on Russia amid the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine.

It can also be easily found on MI5’s official <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/careers/current-jobs/job.aspx?id=134" target="_blank">website</a>. </p><p> Successful applicants will be tasked with listening to telephone calls in Russian, working with written documents “intercepted under warrant” and providing expert support to investigative officers. </p><p> The fluent Russian speakers will be giving <em>“clear analysis in a variety of ways”</em> that, MI5 says, will <em>“help safeguard national security.”</em> </p><p> <em>“Your work will enable us to take a well-informed view of potential threats to national security, including terrorism and espionage,”</em> the job description reads. </p><p> MI5’s Russian intelligence analysts will be also cooperating with the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). </p><p> Those who get the job will be paid £30,000 ($50,000) a year. </p><p> Aside from fluent Russian, British citizenship or residency is also a must. </p><p> MI5’s recruitment comes amid growing tensions between the West and Russia over the political crisis in Ukraine, a former republic of the Soviet Union. While the two sides agree on the necessity of de-escalation of the situation in Ukraine, there is still no agreement on approaches. </p><p> While the West is accusing Moscow of attempts to undermine sovereignty of the country, Russia is blaming the US and its European allies for fueling Maidan protests and supporting the coup-appointed Kiev government. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155192-us-philippines-security-pact/</guid><title><![CDATA[US denies 10yr Philippines security pact aimed against China]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155192-us-philippines-security-pact/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e3/80/00/000_hkg9614632.jpg" title="An armed US marine patrols next to seahawk helicopters on the deck of 7th Fleet command ship, USS Blue Ridge shortly after arriving at the international port in Manila on March 18, 2014, for a port visit.

(AFP Photo / Ted Aljibe)" /> <p> The Enhanced Defense Cooperation agreement would permit the enhanced “rotational presence” of US forces in the Philippines. <br><br> The American military will also be able to train and conduct exercises with their Philippine counterparts for maritime security, disaster assistance and humanitarian aid. <br><br> It would also allow US troops, aircraft and ships to pass through the Philippines and see the creation of storages facilities for American equipment. <br><em><br> “We are not doing this because of China. We are doing this because we have a longstanding alliance partner [the Philippines]. They are interested in stepping up our military-to-military,”</em> Evan Medeiros, Obama’s top advisor on Asia, was cited as saying by AFP. <br><br> Filipino negotiators previously said that the deal wouldn’t allow the US to establish military bases in the country, or position nuclear weapons there. <br><br> But Medeiros still called the document <em>“the most significant agreement that we [the US] have concluded with the Philippines in decades.”</em> <br><br> The treaty runs for 10 years, which is shorter than Washington was originally asking for, but it can be prolonged if both sides see it necessary, two senior US officials told Reuters. <br><br> Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and US ambassador Philip Goldberg will put their signatures under the deal on April 28, just a few hours before President Barack Obama arrives to the Philippine capital, Manila, as part of his week-long Asian tour. <br><br> The United States is expected to gradually deploy combat ships, a squadron of F18s or F16s and maritime surveillance aircraft to the Philippines under the deal, a military source told Reuters. <br><br><em>“We are considering bases in Northern Luzon like Clark and Subic, and Fort Magsaysay, to accommodate the US forces. We will set aside space in those bases for their troops,"</em> the source said. <br><br> Clark and Subic were the two military bases maintained by the US military northwest of Manila until 1992, when the Philippines Senate voted to evict American troops from the country. <br><br> However, eight years later, the Senate approved an agreement allowing for temporary visits by US forces and joint military drills between the armies of the two states. <br><br> A total of 149 US Navy vessels visited the Philippines last year – almost a two-fold increase in comparison with 68 ships in 2012. <br> Manila has been seeking greater military and diplomatic support from the US in recent years, due to a territorial dispute with China. <br><br> Beijing, which claims most of the resources-rich South China Sea, has seized control of Scarborough Shoal in 2012 despite the island being situated far closer to the Filipino landmass than the Chinese. <br><br> The Chinese refused to participate in the UN tribunal on the validity of its territorial claims, which the Philippines imitated, saying that the move “seriously damaged” bilateral relations. <br><br> In March, Chinese vessels tried to block ships, which were bringing supplies to a Philippine military outpost on a tiny reef also claimed by Beijing. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
