She was wrongly accused of being an informant. </p><p> Adams, 65, said in a statement that he was <em>“innocent of any part”</em> of McConville’s death, Reuters reported. Her body was recovered from a beach in County Louth in 2003. </p><p> The Police Service of Northern Ireland said in a statement that a man had “presented himself” to authorities Wednesday evening, but they did not name the suspect. </p><p> Sinn Fein said in a statement: <em>“Last month Gerry Adams said he was available to meet the PSNI about the Jean McConville case. That meeting is taking place this evening."</em> </p><p> Last month, Ivor Bell, a leader in the Provisional IRA in the 1970s, was charged with aiding and abetting McConville’s murder. Other arrests have recently been made in connection with the murder. </p><p> Bell’s case was based on an interview which he allegedly gave to researchers at Boston College in the United States. A series of candid, confessional interviews with former loyalists and republican paramilitaries was taped in an effort to provide an oral history of the Troubles. </p><p> Interviewees were told that the tapes would not be released to the public until after their deaths, but a series of court cases in the US resulted in some of the content being handed to law enforcement. </p><p> An investigation by the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman cleared McConville of accusations that she was an informant. According to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR), McConville was one of 16 people known as the <em>'Disappeared'</em> – those abducted, murdered, and buried in secret by republicans during the era of the Troubles. </p><p> The IRA admitted in 1999 that it murdered and secretly buried nine of the Disappeared. The other seven have yet to be found. The ICLVR is aimed at locating the remains of those still missing. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156056-imf-approves-ukraine-aid/</guid><title><![CDATA[IMF gives green light for $17 bn Ukraine aid package]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156056-imf-approves-ukraine-aid/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/80/00/imf-approves-ukraine-aid.jpg" title="The International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters building is seen in Washington, DC (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 21:18:47 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/80/00/imf-approves-ukraine-aid.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The International Monetary Fund has approved a two-year $17 billion loan package for Ukraine.

General Michael Flynn (Reuters / Gary Cameron)" /> <p> United States DIA Director Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn is expected to announce later in the day that he’s walking away from that role a year earlier than anticipated, the Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/head-of-pentagon-intelligence-agency-forced-out-officials-say/2014/04/30/ec15a366-d09d-11e3-9e25-188ebe1fa93b_story.html" target="_blank">reported</a>, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. </p><p> Journalists Greg Miller and Adam Goldman at the DC paper were the first to break the news on Wednesday, and according to them the director’s unexpected announcement is the result of increased pressure coming from the likes of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and others who reportedly did not agree with Flynn’s managerial style. </p><p> <em>“His vision in DIA was seen as disruptive; he’s not a guy to take the agency forward in a coordinated and comprehensive manner,”</em> one former Pentagon official told the Post of Flynn, a former colleague. </p><p> Flynn, the source said, wanted to push DIA analysts and operators <em>“up and out of their cubicles into the field to support war fighters or high-intensity operations.”</em> </p><p> Critics of Flynn, the journalists wrote, considered his management style to have <em>“sowed chaos, setting aggressive plans for changes without adequate follow-through”</em> within the agency. </p><p> <em>“I’m not sure DIA sees itself as that,</em>” their source said to the paper. </p><p> According to Miller and Goldman, the decision to take Flynn out of his DIA role comes in the midst of other major changes within both the US intelligence community and military, both of which have been shaken up in recent months after former government contractor Edward Snowden began releasing a trove of sensitive material to the media. </p><p> <em>“I think if I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries,”</em> Flynn said of Snowden during a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/03/07/287037148/transcript-interview-with-lt-gen-michael-flynn" target="_blank">NPR</a> interview that aired last month. </p><p> Previously, Flynn served in the US Army and participated in tours that brought him to Grenada, Haiti, Afghanistan and Iraq. US President Barack Obama picked Flynn to be DIA director two years ago this month, and he was expected to depart from that role in 2015. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156032-lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda/</guid><title><![CDATA[US doesn’t care about Ukraine, wants to prove it's still in charge – Lavrov]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156032-lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/00/00/lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda-.jpg" title="Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (Reuters / Suzanne Plunkett)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:38:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/18/00/00/lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Washington's approach to the events in Ukraine is not fueled by concerns about the fate of the crisis-torn state, but rather by the desire to prove it is still running the show worldwide, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/00/00/lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (Reuters / Suzanne Plunkett)" /> <p> The way the situation in Ukraine is reported in mainstream media indicates that “<em>unfortunately, the information machine of our Western colleagues is working at full capacity</em>,” Lavrov said following talks with his Chilean counterpart, Heraldo Munoz, in Santiago. </p><p> The US is trying to shape public opinion in a specific manner “<em>because they are not concerned by the fate of Ukraine in the first place, but have strong desire to prove that it’s them who decides how things should be – always and everywhere,</em>” Lavrov stated. </p><p> The foreign minister stressed that sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and its allies are the result of such a stance, and will have a costly outcome for Washington in the long run. </p><p> However, Moscow currently has no plans to retaliate against the “<em>meaningless</em>” sanctions from the West, he said. </p><p> <em>“At this stage, we want to give our partners a chance to calm down</em>,” Lavrov said. “<em>We’ll see what happens next. If absolutely baseless notations towards Russia will continue, if there are attempts to pressure us with economic leverage, then we may reevaluate the situation.”</em> </p><p> Lavrov has advised the US to “<em>discipline those whom they brought to power in Ukraine</em>” instead of sanctioning Moscow. </p><p> </p><p> He stated that despite declaring themselves “<em>winners of the democratic revolution</em>,” the current government in Kiev is based “<em>on a coalition which includes candid radicals and extremists, condemned even by the EU back in 2012 when the Svoboda party first made it to parliament.”</em> <br></p><p> <br> “<em>But now the Europeans are shyly forgetting about that and cooperate with those same people</em>,” Lavrov added. <br><br> The minister stressed the need to establish a direct dialogue between the coup-imposed Ukrainian authorities and protestors in the nation's southeast in order to solve the crisis in the country. <br><br> “<em>The role of Russia, the US, and Europe, or any other interested state, isn’t about blanching one of sides of the Ukrainian conflict,</em>” he said. </p><p> Lavrov also stated that Moscow has made an attempt to establish a dialogue by proposing a ‘round table’ discussion between Kiev and representatives of the southeastern regions within the framework of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). <br><br> “<em>However, the US and EU representatives have blocked this initiative,”</em> he stressed. “<em>This is sad. We’ll continue to call for the full implementation of the Geneva Declaration, which our partners are trying to distance themselves from.”</em> <br><br> As for the OSCE observers who are still being held by anti-Kiev protesters in the town of Slavyansk, Russia is “urging for them to be released,” Lavrov said. </p><p> </p><p> “<em>But we cannot decide for the self-defense forces</em>,” he added. “<em>Those people live under a constant threat coming from Kiev that the military and armored vehicles will be used against them; under constant threat from the extremists.”</em> <br><br> Southeastern Ukraine has been gripped by ongoing protests, with the majority of its Russian-speaking population refusing to recognize the new authorities in Kiev, who took the reins via a military coup powered by far-right radicals. <br><br> Activists in Donetsk, Lugansk, and other regions have seized government buildings and are demanding a referendum on federalization. <br><br> Despite failing to provide any proof, Washington continues to blame Moscow for masterminding the uprising in Ukraine's southeast. <br><br> The US and its allies have already imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia, targeting individual politicians and businessmen, as well as several companies. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156012-oklahoma-botched-execution-review/</guid><title><![CDATA[Oklahoma governor orders review of botched execution]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156012-oklahoma-botched-execution-review/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/c0/00/oklahoma-botched-execution-review.jpg" title="Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin (Reuters)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:30:35 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/16/c0/00/oklahoma-botched-execution-review.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Oklahoma Gov.

I believe the death penalty is an appropriate response and punishment to those who commit heinous crimes against their fellow men and women,”</em> the Republican governor said at a press conference Tuesday night. <em>“However, I also believe the state needs to be certain of its protocols and its procedures for executions, and that they work.”</em> </p><p> Clayton D. Lockett, 38, was <a href="http://rt.com/usa/155764-controversial-oklahoma-execution-wrong/"> scheduled to be executed</a> at 6pm local time Tuesday with a combination of lethal drugs, details of which were kept secret despite a flurry of court challenges and commentary from Oklahoma lawmakers in the weeks leading up to Lockett’s death. <a href="http://rt.com/usa/oklahoma-lethal-execution-drugs-905/">The state said in advance</a> it would use a combination of the sedative midazolam, the muscle relaxer pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride in the lethal injection procedure. </p><p> But the execution by lethal injection soon went wrong. The execution officially began at 6:23pm, but was cancelled because Lockett was still moving at 6:37 and looked up to say, <em>“Something’s wrong.”</em> </p><p> Department of Corrections officials said at a press conference immediately following the would-be execution that Lockett had blown a vein and that they are not sure where the drugs went in his body, or how much of the injection his body absorbed. Lockett died of a heart attack moments after his convulsion began. </p><p> The independent review will look into Lockett’s cause of death, whether or not the Department of Corrections followed the current protocol for executions and develop recommendations to improve execution protocols for the Department of Corrections, Fallin said at the press conference. Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Thompson will head up the investigation, which will also employ an independent pathologist to determine the cause of death. </p><p> Lockett was convicted of the 1999 kidnapping, rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman, who had been buried alive, MSNBC reports. Charles Warner, who was also scheduled to be executed Tuesday night, was convicted of raping and killing his girlfriend’s 11-month-old daughter in 1997. Fallin granted Warner a stay of execution until at least May 13. </p><p> <em>“I have not given Commissioner Thompson a deadline to complete the review. If he has not completed the review by May 13, an additional stay will be issued at that time,”</em> Fallin said. <em>“If there are adjustments that he needs to make or that need to be made to the state’s execution protocols, those adjustments will be made.”</em> </p><p> She went on to add, <em>“Charles Warner also had his day in court. He committed a horrible crime: physical abuse, rape and murder of an 11-month-old baby. His fellow Oklahomans have sentenced him to death, and we expect that sentence to be carried out as required by law.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156000-fcc-wheeler-blog-franken/</guid><title><![CDATA[FCC chairman stands by proposed net neutrality rules]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156000-fcc-wheeler-blog-franken/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/00/00/net-neutrality-figh.jpg" title="U.S. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler (Reuters / Jason Reed)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:12:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/16/00/00/net-neutrality-figh.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The chairman of the United States Federal Communication Commission is continuing to stand by a proposal concerning the future of the so-called “Open Internet” this week despite ongoing criticism.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/00/00/net-neutrality-figh.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler (Reuters / Jason Reed)" /> <p> In the midst of a cloud of negative attention surrounding a draft Open Internet Notice of Proposed Rulemaking document being considered by the FCC, the agency’s chairman, Thomas Wheeler, again attempted to quell concerns. </p><p> According to a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/finding-best-path-forward-protect-open-internet" target="_blank">blog post</a> authored by Wheeler published on the FCC’s official blog on Tuesday, the chairman is committed to making sure proposed open internet rules won’t drastically erode the concept of net neutrality as critics have suggested. </p><p> Skeptics have voiced concerns that, if adopted, the draft document’s rules would let Internet Service Providers transmit data to end-users more quickly if the applicable content producers pay more to the ISPs. </p><p> Such concerns, Wheeler wrote on Tuesday, miss the point. <em>“The proposed rule is built to ensure that everyone has access to an Internet that is sufficiently robust to enable consumers to access the content, services and applications they demand, as well as an Internet that offers innovators and edge providers the ability to offer new products and services,”</em> he wrote. </p><p> Approval of these guidelines would not create a “<em>fast lane</em>” for the web as some have suggested, Wheeler wrote, and any attempts to do as much would be “<em>shut down</em>” by the FCC. </p><p> <em>“At the heart of the proposed NPRM is the assurance that it won’t be possible for an Internet provider to degrade the service available to all,”</em> Wheeler wrote. <em>“Let me re-emphasize that: the Internet will remain like it is today, an open pathway. If a broadband provider (ISP) acts in a manner that keeps users from effectively taking advantage of that pathway then it should be a violation of the Open Internet rules.”</em> </p><p> On Wednesday, Wheeler told the audience at the annual meeting of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association in Los Angeles that “<em>reports that we are gutting the Open Internet rules are incorrect</em>,” according to <a href="http://time.com/82409/wheeler-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">TIME</a>. </p><p> <em>“If you read some of the press accounts about what we propose to do, those of you who oppose net neutrality might feel like a celebration was in order,”</em> Wheeler said. <em>“Reports that we are gutting the Open Internet rules are incorrect. I am here to say ‘wait a minute.’ Put away the party hats.”</em> </p><p> <em>"Let me be clear. If someone acts to divide the Internet between 'haves' and 'have-nots,' we will use every power at our disposal to stop it,"</em> Wheeler insisted. </p><p> In the midst of a wave of criticism that erupted last week, Wheeler responded at the time that, <em>“To be very direct, the proposal would establish that behavior harmful to consumers or competition by limiting the openness of the Internet will not be permitted.”</em> </p><p> First, however, the five-person FCC board will have to decide if they want to move forward with the guidelines presented to them last week. Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/29/us-usa-internet-fcc-idUSBREA3S18W20140429?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews" target="_blank">reported</a> that the agency will vote on May 15 on Wheeler’s proposed rules. In the meantime, though, the FCC will likely see criticism only continue to mount up: earlier this week, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minnesota) became the latest American lawmaker to oppose Wheeler’s proposal, and wrote in a letter to the chairman that his plan to let companies pay for preferential access to ISPS and ergo internet customers would “<em>destroy</em>” the concept of net neutrality. </p><p> "<em>Your proposal would grant Verizon, Comcast, and other ISPs the power to pick winners and losers on the Internet, which violates core Net neutrality principles that you have publicly supported in the past. Although you claim that this proposal is not a ‘turnaround,’ it is difficult to understand how it does not flatly contradict your own Commission's Open Internet Order</em>,” Franken wrote, according to <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/franken-says-fcc-net-neutrality-would-destroy-open-internet/" target="_blank">CNET</a>. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/156028-russia-sues-eu-energy/</guid><title><![CDATA[Russia sues EU over ‘Third Energy Package’ - report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/156028-russia-sues-eu-energy/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/c0/00/russia-sues-the-eu-over-the-__third-energy-package__.jpg" title="Reuters / Yury Maltsev"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:11:17 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/17/c0/00/russia-sues-the-eu-over-the-__third-energy-package__.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Russia has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the EU's so-called 'Third Energy Package,' according to media reports.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/c0/00/russia-sues-the-eu-over-the-__third-energy-package__.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Yury Maltsev" /> <p> <em>“This procedure is provided for in the rules of the Organization,” a source said, adding that “Russia sent a note to the EU Mission at the WTO and notified the WTO Secretariat thereof,”</em> Itar-Tass news agency reported. </p><p> A second news agency, Interfax, stated that a <em>“source close to WTO”</em> spoke of <em>“the start [of a] court examination.”</em> The agency said it obtained confirmation from the director of the Ministry of Economic Development’s department of trade negotiations, Maksim Medvedkov. </p><p> Signed in 2007, the Third Energy Package outlines a set of rules regulating the European gas and electricity market. The European Commission insists the Third Energy Package was aimed at increasing competition on the energy market, allowing other players to join the sector and liberalizing energy prices. </p><p> One of the core elements prohibits a single company from both owning and operating a gas pipeline and contains rules on third party access to the natural oil transportation grid. </p><p> <em>“These and other elements of the Third Energy Package, in the opinion of Russia, contradict the obligations of the EU in WTO on basic principles of non-discrimination and market access...the Third Energy Package creates serious obstacles to ensure a stable supply of Russian gas to the EU, including a threat to the construction of new transport infrastructure, for example, in the framework of the ‘South Stream,'”</em> Medvedkov told Interfax. </p><p> Moscow broke ground on the South Stream project after securing agreements with intergovernmental agreements with all countries which the pipeline would pass through: Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, and Croatia. </p><p> The Third Energy regulation mandates 50 percent of the pipeline can be operated by Russia's Gazprom, but the other 50 percent must be operated by a third party, a condition Russian energy ministers do not accept, as Gazprom is the only company that has the right to export gas via pipeline. </p><p> Russian President Vladimir Putin previously stated that the "Third Energy Package" and other documents “should not be backdated to the contracts that were signed before the decision on the Third Energy Package came into force.” </p><p> Medvedkov has stressed that Russia has unsuccessfully tried to solve <em>“emerging problems”</em> on a bilateral level. </p><p> Now, under WTO rules, Russia and the EU have 60 days to hold joint consultations. If no solution is found during this time, Moscow can demand the right to initiate the creation of a group of independent arbitrators to look into the case. </p><p> However, Medvedkov has not ruled out the possibility of Russia and the EU reaching an agreement during consultations. </p><p> <em>“We do not aim to have legal proceedings with Brussels for the sake of the judicial process, we want to ensure predictable conditions for export to the EU under WTO rules,”</em> he said. </p><p> The Third Energy Package is a set of regulations for an internal gas and electricity market in the European Union.

Sunlight and heat create conditions that increase the risk of high ozone levels."</em> </p><p> There are, however, four cities in the US where the air was clean of ozone and short-term particle pollution. They were also on the list of the cleanest cities for year-round particle pollution. According to the report, the cleanest cities are Bangor (ME), Bismarck (ND), Cape Coral-Fort Myers (FL) and Salinas (CA). </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156016-lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail/</guid><title><![CDATA[Huge fire erupts in Virginia following train derailment (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156016-lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/00/00/lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail.jpg" title="Screenshot from youtube.com/channel/UCGuTdI5_Zv0CLDXLJcYrlEw"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 19:18:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/17/00/00/lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A train derailed in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia Wednesday afternoon, causing a major fire to erupt at the scene of the accident.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/00/00/lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Screenshot from youtube.com/channel/UCGuTdI5_Zv0CLDXLJcYrlEw" /> <p> Local ABC affiliate WSET News reported that the derailment occurred at around 2 p.m. in the afternoon adjacent to the James River, and eye-witnesses say that before long the area was cloaked in heavy black smoke and flames extending as high as 80-feet into the air. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YA4Mir-Wo9E" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> Lynchburg’s News and Advance paper reported that the train did not contain passenger cars, but was rather a tube car train, potentially carrying chemicals, according to city fire marshal Thomas Goode. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Wow.

Wall Street Journal reporter Kristine Peterson <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/04/30/gop-senators-push-for-tougher-response-to-putin/" target="_blank">added</a> Wednesday morning that the military aspect of the proposal, if approved, would require the White House to substantially increase US and NATO support for the armed forces of allied Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, as well as accelerate implementation of missile defense in Europe. </p><p> On Monday this week, the White House imposed additional sanctions on Russia. Those sanctions targeted seven Russian government officials and 17 companies closely tied with Russia’s Pres. Vladimir Putin. </p><p> <em>“Since April 17, Russia has done nothing to meet its Geneva commitments and in fact has further escalated the crisis,”</em> White House press secretary Jay Carney <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/04/28/statement-press-secretary-ukraine"> said</a> on Monday this week. <em>“Russia’s involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable.”</em> </p><p> <em>“The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally; the goal is to change his calculus, to encourage him to walk the walk, not just talk the talk</em>,” Obama said. </p><p> <em>“I think what is happening now shows us who really was mastering the process from the beginning,”</em> Pres. Putin <a href="http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/">said</a> in response this week<em>. “But in the beginning, the United States preferred to remain in the shadow.”</em> </p><p> The Kremlin fired back at first, and said Russia would not be hurt by the sanctions. Now just days later, conservative members of Congress are saying it’s time for Uncle Sam to up the ante. </p><p> <em>“What we’ve seen from the administration is a lot of rhetoric,”</em> Sen.Bob Corker(R-Tennessee) said Wednesday morning, according to the Journal. </p><p> <em>"Until Putin feels the real pain of sanctions targeting entities like Gazprom, which the Kremlin uses to coerce Ukraine <a href="http://www.reuters.com/places/ukraine?lc=int_mb_1001"></a>and other neighbors, as well as some significant financial institutions, I don't think diplomacy will change Russian behavior and de-escalate this crisis,"</em> he said in a statement. </p><p> Sen. Dan Coats (R-Indiana) added in his own remarks that <em>“The lack of a forceful, effective response by the administration and Western leaders has given Putin little reason to expect that further aggression will be punished."</em> </p><p> <em>“We are introducing tough diplomatic, economic and financial sanctions, and I am hopeful that President Obama will support our effort,”</em> Coats said. </p><p> Washington has blamed Moscow for encouraging a recent uprising in eastern Ukraine and the nearby peninsula of Crimea that has displaced several local governments and imposed pro-Russian officials in their place. The recent Geneva treaty was signed with the goal of relaxing tensions in the region ahead of upcoming elections in Ukraine being held to replace the country’s recently ousted president Viktor Yanukovych, both leaders in both the US and Russia have accused one another of failing to abide by those terms. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156004-georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare/</guid><title><![CDATA[Georgia to demand drug tests for welfare recipients]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156004-georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.jpg" title="Georgia Governor Nathan Deal (Reuters / Tami Chappell)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 18:49:29 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed a bill on Tuesday that requires drug testing for some welfare applicants – and makes them foot the bill as well.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Georgia Governor Nathan Deal (Reuters / Tami Chappell)" /> <p> According to local NBC affiliate WXIA, the new law will place the fate of a welfare/food stamp applicant in the hands of state employees, who will determine whether or not a drug test is necessary. Generally, this decision would be made by taking into account an individual’s police record, demeanor, reasons for termination from employment, and any missed appointments. </p><p> On Monday, the day before Deal signed the legislation into law, the governor described the challenges facing the proposal that ultimately won his signature. </p><p> <em>"You're trying to balance two competing forces,”</em> he told WXIA. <em>“First is the right of the individual if they qualify to be given assistance in terms of food stamps. On the other hand, the right of the taxpayer not to be putting money in the hands of those abusing drugs. So it's a delicate balance of social issues.”</em> </p><p> The bill has been dubbed <em>“the toughest in the nation when it comes to public assistance”</em> by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, but supporters claim that it ensures anyone receiving taxpayer money is doing so fairly. </p><p> <em>“We passed a bill that simply insists on some level of personal responsibility of people who receive public funds for their support and livelihood,”</em> said state Speaker of the House David Ralston (R). </p><p> Opponents, however, argue that since the state increasingly uses the internet and the phone to manage applications, officials don’t have the kind of in-person interaction necessary to validate claims of reasonable suspicion that require a drug test. </p><p> Additionally, the bill forces applicants to pay for their drug exam – regardless of whether or not they test positive for anything – and places what opponents see as yet another obstacle in the way of the state’s poorest residents. </p><p> <em>"It's a badly flawed bill,"</em> Debbie Seagraves of Georgia’s American Civil Liberties Union said to Reuters. <em>"It will be challenged.”</em> </p><p> <em>"It's one thing for a judge, or district attorney, or police officer to judge what's reasonable suspicion,”</em> added Sen. Vincent Ford (D) to WXIA. <em>“But giving it to an overworked bureaucrat? I think it is bottom line, unfair.”</em> </p><p> As noted by Reuters, other states have tried to implement like-minded bills only to see them fall by the wayside. Last year, a federal judge struck down a similar bill, ruling it violated applicants’ constitutional rights against unreasonable search. Meanwhile, the Republican governor of North Carolina vetoed a drug-testing bill in 2013, arguing it had generated no tangible benefits in other states. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155984-stop-search-police-uk/</guid><title><![CDATA[UK Home Secretary urges ‘illegal’ stop and search practice overhaul]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155984-stop-search-police-uk/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.jpg" title="Reuters/Andrew Winning"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 18:15:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK Home Secretary Theresa May has called for an overhaul of police stop and search powers, telling the House of Commons that as many as 250,000 illegal stop and searches may have been undertaken last year.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Andrew Winning" /> <p> May announced plans to change the law, suggesting a review of all stop and search training, and making officers undertake an assessment of their awareness of the practice rules. </p><p> She added that if the number of stop and searches taking place did not drop then she would start making calls for a change to the law. </p><p> <em>“Nobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police,”</em> May told MPs. </p><p> Black people are seven times more likely to be stopped by police than white people. Additionally, only 10 percent of searches actually result in arrest, according to a recent study by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. </p><p> Police are presently allowed to stop somebody only if there are reasonable grounds upon which to suspect that an individual is carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property, or something which could be used to commit a crime, e.g. a crowbar. </p><p> May demanded clarity on what constituted ‘reasonable grounds,’ as well as the opening of records for public scrutiny and <em>“unconscious bias awareness training”</em> to reduce the risk of discrimination. </p><p> As evidence of the necessity for a reform package, May cited the recent study by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. Its conclusions showed that with 27 percent of stop and search records examined, there were no reasonable grounds upon which to search people, despite a supervisor having given the green light for searches to take place. </p><p> <em>”If the HMIC sample is accurate, that means more than a quarter of the million or so stops carried out under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act last year could have been illegal,”</em> stated May. </p><p> The Labour Party said that May’s plans do not go far enough. </p><p> Her opposition counterpart, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper asked her: <em>“Why aren't you banning the use of targets given to police officers to stop and search a certain number of people?”</em> Cooper also questioned why the guidance on race discrimination didn’t have a statutory basis and why there was no insistence that all forces abide by case law instead of just “some.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155980-fidel-salinas-anonymous-indicted/</guid><title><![CDATA[FBI may put alleged Anonymous member behind bars for 440 years]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155980-fidel-salinas-anonymous-indicted/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/c0/00/fidel_salinas.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Raul Arboleda"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 17:19:30 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/14/c0/00/fidel_salinas.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A man accused of being a member of the amorphous hacktivist movement Anonymous now faces a total of 44 charges after federal investigators announced on Tuesday the filing of second superseding indictment against Fidel Salinas of Donna, Texas.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/c0/00/fidel_salinas.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Raul Arboleda" /> <p> Salinas, 27, was first charged last October with one count of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act after a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas said he intentionally tried to hack into the computer system of Hidalgo County practically two years earlier. A superseding indictment was unsealed earlier this month on April 2 and introduced 15 additional counts against Salinas, but this week the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that even more charges have since been brought. </p><p> The FBI <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/sanantonio/press-releases/2014/alleged-anonymous-computer-hacker-charged-with-18-counts-of-cyberstalking" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on Tuesday that Salinas now faces a total of 44 charges due to his supposed role in attempting to hack computer systems belonging to Hidalgo County, the La Joya Independent School District and The Monitor newspaper of McAllen, TX, as well as the computer of an unnamed female victim he is alleged to have cyber-stalked at least 18 times in December 2011. </p><p> Authorities say that Salinas conspired with members of the internationally-dispersed hacktivist collective Anonymous to coordinate these attacks, and spent at least six months conversing with others in a chat room affiliated with the group’s Operation Anti-Security, or Antisec, faction. </p><p> Salinas pleaded not guilty in October 2013 to the single-count indictment related to the Hidalgo County hack and was scheduled to stand trial in March, but proceedings were continuously put on hold until earlier this month when the first superseding indictment was unsealed on April 2 and he was further accused of 15 new counts involving the county computer system, the school district and The Monitor. Salinas again pleaded not guilty to all counts at an arraignment on April 10, but authorities have now confirmed that additional charges have been introduced in a second superseding indictment. </p><p> In Tuesday’s statement, the FBI said: <em>"Salinas faces up to 10 years in federal prison on each of the charges, upon conviction."</em> If correct, then prosecutors could seek upwards of 440 years. </p><p> The FBI's announcement was absent specific details about the latest charges, but those were made public on Wednesday afternoon when the newest indictment was uploaded to the PACER court records site. </p><p> <em>“According to the allegations, between Dec. 23-29, 2011, Salinas had the intent to harass and intimidate a female victim. Allegedly, he repeatedly e-mailed her, attempted to gain unauthorized access to her website, made submissions through a contact form on that site and tried to open user accounts without her consent,</em>” the FBI said in Tuesday’s statement. </p><p> <em>“The indictment lists his alleged attempts to stalk her and hack into her website. According to the indictment, he repeatedly did so late at night and early in the morning, with his stalking attempts or messages sometimes occurring less than one minute apart from each other. He allegedly did so as part of a conspiracy or agreement with at least one other person, according to the charges.”</em> </p><p> Earlier this month, legal counsel for Salinas told the Associated Press that prosecutors wouldn’t be able to persevere in court. </p><p> <em>“They can’t make a case against my client,”</em> attorney Alma Garza told the <a href="http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2014-04-10/south-texas-man-accused-hacking-attempts" target="_blank">AP</a>, adding that the case against Salinas has dragged on for two years. </p><p> Indeed, the trove of court documents that is accessible suggests that the authorities have been pursuing charges against Salinas for some time already. The first document in Salinas’ criminal docket is dated September 11, 2013 and consists of a criminal complaint filed by FBI Special Agent Truoung Nguyen containing allegations about alleged hacks from early 2012. </p><p> <iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/221201246/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="undefined" id="doc_16902" name="doc_16902" frameborder="0" height="600" scrolling="no" width="100%"></iframe> </p><p> According to Special Agent Nguyen, authorities narrowed in on their target that January after investigators linked an attempt to breach the site of Hidalgo County with a computer within a residence where Salinas was staying. Salinas <em>“made over 14,000 attempts to log into their website server,”</em> Nguyen charged, in turn slowing down the system for administrators and visitors alike and eventually requiring the county to hire tech specialists. In all, the hack is alleged to have cost Hidalgo County $10,620.32, according to the Sept. 2013 complaint. </p><p> Nguyen said the IP address of the computer used by Salinas was responsible for those thousands of attempted intrusions, and a search warrant executed a week after the hack occurred ended with the FBI seizing his laptops and recovering forensic evidence that linked him to the attacks. </p><p> Salinas was interviewed by FBI Special Agent Christopher Wallingsford several months later in September 2012 and admitted during that meeting and at a later one that he used a program on his computer to attempt to gain administrative access to the site, but that his efforts were to test the network’s security. </p><p> <em>“Salinas claimed that he was not trying to do anything illegal but thought that if he gained access [he] would passed on that information to the Hidalgo County Network Administrator as a courtesy,”</em> the complaint alleged. </p><p> Days after the Hidalgo breach landed him in handcuffs and the loss of his computers, Salinas authored an angry diatribe on his Facebook page believed to be directed at Hidalgo. </p><p> <em>“Fuck you corrupt officials and politicians,”</em> Salinas wrote. <em>“When someone tries to give you advice that your servers aren’t secure and said person doesn’t modify, access or download and ‘redistricted’ information. I believe you say thank you instead of being afraid of what you don’t know by getting an invalid warrant, arresting and wrongfully hijacking all his electronics.”</em> </p><p> Salinas, authorities say, ended the diatribe with a phrase commonly used within Anonymous: “<em>We do not forgive, we do not forget.”</em> </p><p> When the first superseding indictment was unveiled earlier this month, the FBI accused Salinas of 15 additional counts related to that hack and others, and introduced an overt fact to that charges: On or about June 6, 2011, Salinas entered the AntiSec chatroom affiliated with Anonymous. The hacktivist group’s name is otherwise absent from the indictment, except to note that Salinas joined a separate chatroom associated with the group six months later. </p><p> The FBI’s announcement this week did not blame Anonymous for the hacks per se, but instead acknowledged just that <em>“Salinas is allegedly linked to the computer-hacking group Anonymous.”</em> According to first superseding indictment, Salinas conducted a method of hack know as a SQL-injection against the targeted sites starting in November 2011. </p><p> With regards to the latest charged pertaining to alleged counts of cyber-stalking, authorities say Salinas did so with the aid of another party, but whether they believe those events were associated with Anonymous is not clear. The forensic examination of his computers seized in early 2012 reportedly contained logs from Anonymous-related chatrooms dating back to mid-2011, however, but reference to Salinas’ alleged role with AntiSec raises one other issue of note: authorities say Salinas began conversing with other AntiSec members on June 6, 2011 — hours before authorities arrested the Anonymous hacker responsible for that faction, Hector Xavier Monsegur, and recruited him as a federal informant. Monsegur is expected to be sentenced next week in New York City, but half-a-dozen hearings have previously been adjourned due to his ongoing cooperation with investigators. </p><p> The indictment made public on Wednesday now combines all charges against Salinas as found by the grand jury: counts one and two pertain to attempting to breach the county, school district and newspaper sites; count three alleges he conspired with others to use a computer “to cause emotional distress” to the female victim, identified only as “Y.V.”; count four involves an attempted hack of Y.V’s computer; counts five through 22 allege Salinas attempted to distress the victim multiple times over the internet on his own; 33 through 37 relate to the allege attempts to hack the woman’s computer; counts 38 through 43 pertain to attempting to hack the three other sites between November 2011 and January 2012 and count 44 accuses Salinas of attempting to recklessly cause damage to the Hidalgo County sight. </p><p> Counts one, two, four and 23 through 44 are all violations of the federal CFAA hacking law.

Exports fell at a rate of 7.6 percent in the first quarter – the biggest fall since the recession ended. The frigid weather could be to blame for less consumer spending, which only increased at a rate of 0.4 percent. <br><br> The slowdown is in stark contrast to the 3.4 percent economic expansion that the US enjoyed in the second half of 2013. <br><br> “We’ve been living in sub-3 percent land, and people have gotten used to that as the new normal. But it's not. It's anemic,” Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, told The New York Times. <br><br> America's economy slowed drastically in the first quarter of 2014, as wintry weather depressed corporate spending and housing sector activity. Smaller additions to inventories by farmers and businesses also held back growth. <br><br> Business spending dropped 2.1 percent between January and March, as companies spent less on buildings, equipment, and intellectual property. <br><br> Federal spending is set to grow in 2014, which could help offset the lackluster first quarter growth. Most economists are predicting an overall growth of between 2.5 and three percent. <br><br> Later on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will finish its two-day meeting and will likely announce another $10 billion in monthly bond purchases as part of its planned 'tapering’ of stimulus spending. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155992-iraq-elections-winner-corrupt/</guid><title><![CDATA[Iraqi elections: 'Most corrupted one will be the winner']]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155992-iraq-elections-winner-corrupt/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/15/80/00/iraq-elections-winner-corrupt.jpg" title="Photo by Nadezhda Kevorkova"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:39:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/15/80/00/iraq-elections-winner-corrupt.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The one who stole more Iraqi money is in a position to use the election and probably he will win, Muhavad Husam al Dine Al Bayati, Head of the Prime Minister office, told RT’s Nadezhda Kevorkova.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/15/80/00/iraq-elections-winner-corrupt.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo by Nadezhda Kevorkova" /> <p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>Who will be the winner in the parliamentary elections?</em> </p><p> <strong>Muhavad Husam al Dine Al Bayati</strong>: The most corrupted one will be the winner. I do not know who exactly will win. But I can judge that the one who stole more Iraqi money is in position to use the election and probably he will win. And the one who controls the army and the power will win. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>So if the block of the prime minister will win he will be such a person?</em> </p><blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> On April 30 Iraq is holding its first parliamentary elections since the withdrawal of US troops. Sectarian tension in the country is extremely high, while Iraq itself is a fragmented state, and it affects the ongoing voting. Though security was increased significantly, two days before the elections were overshadowed by a wave of deadly attacks. </p> </blockquote><p> <strong>MB</strong>: As you know the corruption in this country is very huge. And there is a lot of money in the hands of some politicians not necessary only from the block of prime minister. There are so many other blocks that stole so much money from the country. They can buy votes and support from IHEC [the Independent High Electoral Commission which approved the voting system and the counting method for 2014 parliamentary elections]. The results will not be very clear. </p><p> We do not have foreign observers or people who are watching the elections. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>People say that 65 American observers came to Iraq especially for the elections, is it so?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: What can these 65 do? Can they work on the street? Can they go to the governorates? Can they go to the election boxes and see how people vote and how their votes are counted? No, they cannot. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>What does it mean, this absence of interest to the first Iraqi elections? Does it mean that the US wants to change Iraqi authorities once more?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: We cannot be sure. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>What will happen after the elections? Will the tension and frequency of terroristic attacks start to grow or not?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: I think there will be a new government; there will be new leaders who will be able to start reconciliation in the country and forget about the past, forget about the revenge going on now in this country which we can’t stand. We need some leaders in the cabinet and in the Parliament who can start real reconciliation. Also there must be real reorganization of the army to contain all Iraqis but not only one sect as it is now. And also we need the reorganization that is related to the economy of the country, so that we can make our economy effective and promote other sectors apart from oil to provide income for the country. Then the economic situation will change. Now we are depending only on oil. And if other sectors do not participate in the economy, this country can collapse. Over 92% of the income of Iraq comes from oil. In 70-80s around 35% of its income came from agriculture. So we are a one-sided economy now. This should not continue. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>Why are people in Iraq saying that during the American presence the situation was better than now?</em> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: Because people are getting harder. They lost their homes. When people lose their homes they go to be extremists. You know they tried to talk to 6 governorates one year in a civilized and peaceful way, but they didn’t pay any attention to them. So they went to be extremists. They used their arms instead of acting in a peaceful way (the demolishing of Iraqi refugees camps in Anbar province in Dec 2013 – RT). This is complicating the situation. Plus there is no real balance in the government organization among the different sects. This made an impression on the Sunnis that they are oppressed and neglected. The distance between al Maliki and the Sunni community became too big. There is no communication and detention started from that. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>Iraqi Christians are running away from Iraq, nobody knows the percentage of Christians in the country now, but some experts think that it is less than a tenth of this community in the past, is it so and is it only one-way ticket for them?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: Even more Sunnis are leaving the country than Christians. I cannot see Iraq without Christians. Iraq was the best place for Christians in the region before the American war. They were treated as real Iraqis. Now because of the terrorist activity, security and neglect by the government they left their homes, but I am sure that when the security is improved all the Iraqis will come back including the Sunnis. I know how much they love Iraq, especially the Christians. Even the Jewish people that left the country – all people who remember the bread of Iraq they never can forget it and they want to come back to see the place where they were born. Now it is a sectarian government, but when it will be civilized government all people will come back. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>What is the role of Iran?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: Iran is one who brought this government in – Maliki’s government. It has huge influence. Their influence here is much stronger than even the American one. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>If so who supports terrorists in Iraq if the role of Iran is so big?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: The support is coming from all over the world, from independent people, probably some organizations but not the governments. </p><p style="text-align: right;"> <em>Nadezda Kevorkova, Baghdad</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155988-colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules/</guid><title><![CDATA[Colorado trying to come up with new rules for edible marijuana]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155988-colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/40/00/colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules.jpg" title="Reuters/Jason Redmond"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:26:22 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/15/40/00/colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Following two recent deaths in Colorado believed to be linked to edible marijuana, state officials have decided to examine and rework regulations related to products such as pot cookies and brownies.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/40/00/colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Jason Redmond" /> <p> According to USA Today, officials will meet on Wednesday to <em>"discuss and consider reasonable amounts of active THC in retail marijuana products in proportion to product serving size."</em> </p><p> Currently, Colorado law states that 10 mg of THC – marijuana’s active ingredient – is equivalent to one serving of the drug, but edible products are not required to be sold in a single serving, nor does the law require pot producers split the package up into separate servings. As reported by the Associated Press, a single package of pot-infused food – sometimes as small as a piece of candy – could contain up to 10 servings of THC. </p><p> <em>"Basically, we are trying to figure out how to come up with a reasonable THC concentration or amount in edibles in proportion to product safety size,"</em> Dr. George Sam Wang of Children's Hospital Colorado told the AP. In the past, Wang has treated children who’d become sick after ingesting pot. </p><p> Earlier this month, NBC reported that a Denver man who shot and killed his wife was reportedly found to have eaten pot candy beforehand, though police said other medication could have been in his system. Police stated the man’s wife was on the phone with 911 asking for help since her husband was <em>“totally hallucinating”</em> and <em>“talking about the end of the world.”</em> By the time police arrived at the house, the wife had been killed with a shotgun. </p><p> In March, meanwhile, a 19-year-old college student from Wyoming died after jumping off the balcony of his hotel room. The student had reportedly eaten an entire pot cookie containing 65 mg of THC – more than six times the recommended dosage in a single serving. According to NBC, the store clerk who sold the cookie suggested breaking it into pieces instead of eating it all at once. </p><p> <em>"Coloradans are used to eating a whole cookie. They're used to eating a whole brownie,"</em> lawyer Christian Sederberg, a member of the task force meeting on Wednesday, told USA Today. <em>"We need to make it easy for the consumer to understand what the product is that they're taking to ensure their safety."</em> </p><p> It’s unclear exactly what kind of regulations state officials are considering. One option could be packaging edible products into pieces that could be easily separated, like a perforated chocolate bar. Another could be to mandate food to be individually wrapped by serving size. </p><p> So far, marijuana advocates are onboard the effort to take another look at regulations. </p><p> <em>"All of us want to make sure people are safe,"</em> Meg Collins of the Denver-based Cannabis Business Alliance, as well as a member of the task force, told the AP. <em>"The industry is stepping up and is looking at the best ways to educate and communicate to its customers safe ways to recreate with marijuana."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155948-mit-bitcoin-free-experiment/</guid><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin field day: MIT freshmen to get free cryptocurrency]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155948-mit-bitcoin-free-experiment/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/c0/00/mit-bitcoin-free-experiment.jpg" title="Reuters/Jim Urquhart "/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:04:52 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/12/c0/00/mit-bitcoin-free-experiment.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Over 4,500 undergrads will each get $100 worth of bitcoin for free once they come back to school this fall as two MIT students plan to conduct the world's largest experiment with the virtual currency.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/c0/00/mit-bitcoin-free-experiment.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Jim Urquhart " /> <p> <em>"We decided to announce this project now to give students lead time,"</em> Dan Elitzer, founder and president of the MIT Bitcoin Club, said in the <a href="http://bitcoin.mit.edu/announcing-the-mit-bitcoin-project/" target="_blank">release</a>. <em>"We want to issue a challenge to some of the brightest technical minds of a generation: When you step on to campus this fall, all of your classmates are going to have access to bitcoin; what are you going to build to give them interesting ways to use it?"</em> </p><p> The MIT Bitcoin Project, as it is called, became possible after Elitzer, who is also an MBA student at MIT's Sloan School of Management, and Jeremy Rubin, 19, - he studies electrical engineering and computer science - raised more than $500,000 in commitments from about 25 donors, MIT alumni. </p><p> Should this experiment go ahead, it will make the MIT campus the first place in the world where it will be possible to have widespread access to bitcoin. </p><p> The project is aimed at building up an ecosystem for digital currencies. However, the two enthusiasts have no clue of how their fellow students – a total of 4,528 undergraduates - will use the bitcoin they will receive this fall. </p><p> It is hoped that such an experiment will spur academic and entrepreneurial activity within the university and give students and researchers a chance to develop bitcoin-related applications. </p><p> <em>“Giving students access to cryptocurrencies is analogous to providing them with internet access at the dawn of the internet era,”</em> said Rubin. </p><p> In the time left to the start of the experiment, Elitzer and Rubin plan to begin preparing the bitcoin ecosystem at MIT, which will involve <em>“working with members of the MIT Bitcoin Club to educate merchants around campus and help them set up to accept bitcoin payments.”</em> </p><p> The fall launch date is intended to give students the summer to work on bitcoin-related projects, Rubin explained. </p><p> <em>“What I’m hoping is that infrastructure gets sufficiently built around MIT that bitcoin actually becomes a useful commodity to have,”</em> Rubin said as cited by the Tech. <em>“I think that MIT should be absolutely the center of the bitcoin universe. As a school that’s a leader in technology and science fields … it’s kind of a shame that we’re not already at this point,”</em> he added. </p><p> The concept of the giveaway bitcoin, reportedly, was initially Rubin's idea that he shared with Elitzer in March. </p><p> The two have been working together to expand it. They originally wanted to give bitcoin to a control group. But Elitzer insisted that every single undergraduate student should take part in the experiment. </p><p> This is not the first bitcoin-related project for both Elitzer and Rubin. </p><p> In 2013, Rubin worked with three other undergraduates on a bitcoin-related project called Tidbit. That experiment, however, ran into trouble: it was subpoenaed by the New Jersey attorney general as part of a consumer fraud investigation. MIT has sent a letter to the New Jersey attorney general in support of Rubin, who is still fighting for the subpoena to be withdrawn. In fact, Rubin and Elitzer met in the fallout of the Tidbit subpoena. </p><p> As for Elitzer, he got interested in bitcoin after working at a non-profit organization, when he saw a potential for cryptocurrencies in countries where people may not have bank accounts. </p><p> Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and completely digital money. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. </p><p> Today, $5.6 billion dollars of bitcoin exist and are traded every day without a central bank, paper currency, or physical security. On April 30, one bitcoin amounts to $443.05. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155944-google-mining-education-app/</guid><title><![CDATA[Google no longer mining student Gmail accounts for targeted ads]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155944-google-mining-education-app/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/80/00/2google-mining-education-app.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Damein Meyer"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:51:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/12/80/00/2google-mining-education-app.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Google will no longer scan student and teacher Gmail messages or use data from Education apps for use in advertising following a legal firestorm that the policy violated privacy rights.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/80/00/2google-mining-education-app.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Damein Meyer" /> <p> The policy shift was first announced by Bram Bout, director of Google for Education, in a <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/protecting-students-with-google-apps.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Wednesday. According to Bout, Google has removed a toggle to enable and disable ads in the Apps for Education Administrator console. He noted that without the toggle, ads in the Apps for Education suite are now automatically turned off, and administrators will not be able to turn them back on. </p><p> The Mountain View, California-based tech giant company had been automatically blocking the ads unless administrators changed the controls. </p><p> Bout also noted that similar changes are being made <em>“for all our Google Apps customers, including Business, Government and for legacy users of the free version, and we’ll provide an update when the rollout is complete.”</em> </p><p> On Thursday, at 16:00 GMT, Bout will co-host a <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GoogleforEducation/posts#+GoogleforEducation/posts" target="_blank">Google hangout</a> to discuss the changes and answer questions. <br> Apps for Education is used by primary and secondary schools worldwide, delivering free online applications including Gmail, Docs, and Spreadsheet, among others. Around 30 million students, teachers and administrators use the service today, according to Google. </p><p> While none of those 30 million users were actually shown ads as a result of the service key word scans, their personal information was still collected by Google so that it could be employed for targeted marketing elsewhere online. </p><p> Although Apps for Education users are now free from such intrusive forms of marketing, everyday Gmail users will still see their emails scanned by an automated system for the sake of ads, customization and security. </p><p> Under its recently revamped terms of service, Google state that <em>"our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.”</em> </p><p> Students and other Gmail users sued Google last year in California, claiming the email scanning violated federal and state wiretap laws. According to the Wall Street Journal, that case spurred Google’s policy change. </p><p> During the litigation, Google admitted to scanning emails sent and received by students who attended schools using Apps for Education. Week magazine reported that such practices may violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a law which protects educational records. </p><p> The nine plaintiffs had hoped to file a “class action” suit to gain financial compensation for Gmail users, as well as to force the company to be more open about its policies. In March, however, US District Judge Lucy Koh rejected the move, which would have allowed the plaintiffs to pool their resources, exposed Google to billions of dollars of potential damages, and given them greater leverage to push for a settlement. </p><p> Instead, email users might have to file suit individually or in small groups, lowering claims and increasing the financial burden of pursuing legal action. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155900-superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Devastating’ implications of drug-resistant superbugs now a reality – WHO]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155900-superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/c0/00/superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance.jpg" title="Reuters/Leonhard Foeger"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:41:34 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0f/c0/00/superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Deadly antibiotic-resistant superbugs are a ‘serious threat’ to world health and no longer merely a prediction for the future, according to a new report by the World Health Organization (WHO). Previously treatable illnesses can now once again kill.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/c0/00/superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Leonhard Foeger" /> <p> <em>“The world is headed for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill,”</em> said Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's assistant director-general for health security. </p><p> The new resistance has the capacity to strike anyone, of any age, on a global scale according to the WHO <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/" target="_blank">report</a>, entitled ‘Antimicrobial resistance: global report on surveillance’, released on Wednesday. It’s the organization’s first ever global report on antibiotic resistance. </p><p> <em>“The implications will be devastating,”</em> stated Fukuda. </p><p> Data spanning 114 different countries was utilized in the study and superbug resistance was found in all regions of the world. The infections were even resistant to a class of antibiotic which fall into a category known as carbapenems – a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic considered one of the last resorts in the treatment of infectious bacterial diseases. </p><p> </p><p> Resistance to last-resort treatments for potentially deadly hospital infections caused by the common Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria have been found in all parts of the world, as has resistance to the most common drugs to treat urinary tract infections caused by E.coli, as well as last resort gonorrhea treatment in 10 developed countries – among them the UK. </p><p> One of the best knows superbugs is MRSA – a staph infection – which is estimated to kill some 19,000 people every year in the US and an equal number in Europe. A new <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/mrsa-spreads-in-households-1.15080" target="_blank">study</a> released last week showed that MRSA, commonly found in hospitals, has settled in a new stronghold – that is US homes, which are a “major reservoir” of a strain called USA300. </p><p> Experts have suggested that the resistance of superbugs stems from the overuse or misuse of antibiotics and <em>“threatens the achievements of modern medicine.”</em> </p><p> Antibiotic resistance is when bacteria adapt and change so that antibiotics no longer work in the treatment of the diseases. </p><p> </p><p> While it has been a prominent 21st century public health concern, the worries have previously remained confined to the realm of predictions rather than actual commentary on present conditions. Resistance was nil when drugs were first introduced to combat such diseases in the 1980s. However, there are now countries where drugs have no impact whatsoever in more than half of all patients. </p><p> <em>“Unless we take significant actions to improve efforts to prevent infections and also change how we produce, prescribe and use antibiotics, the world will lose more and more of these global public health goods and the implications will be devastating,”</em> Fukuda said. </p><p> In response to the WHO report, campaign group Antibiotic Action <em>“specifically”</em> called for steps to be taken. <br> They called for the <em>“establishment of a fully funded global mandatory surveillance program and global/region specific action plans to monitor and contain antimicrobial resistance,”</em> along with advocating strategies to counter the broad global availability of antibiotics. </p><p> <em>“The world needs to respond as it did to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. To do this, we need to be ambitious to succeed – moves such as a fully funded mandatory global surveillance program will document the size of the problem and funded public education will help minimize use – but these are just starting points,”</em> Laura Piddock, director of the group stated. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155976-storm-flooding-florida-alabama/</guid><title><![CDATA[Deadly storms cause massive flooding in Florida and Alabama (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155976-storm-flooding-florida-alabama/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/80/00/storm-flooding-florida-alabama.jpg" title="Photo from Twitter/@IndianaWxOnline"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:27:20 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/14/80/00/storm-flooding-florida-alabama.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />As a deadly weather front continued to make its way across the Southern United States late Tuesday and early Wednesday, both Florida and Alabama were struck with severe flooding that’s left at least one person dead.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/80/00/storm-flooding-florida-alabama.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo from Twitter/@IndianaWxOnline" /> <p> According to the Associated Press, rainfall in the Florida Panhandle – especially the area around Pensacola – and the coast of Alabama has been relentless, dropping well over a foot of rain in both states.

China may pass the US and become the world’s most important economy this year, according to the World Bank. It would take the position the US has held since 1872.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/40/00/china-overtake-us-economy.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Kevin Lamarque" /> <p> Previous studies have suggested China could become the world's biggest economy by 2019. </p><p> Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese economy has contributed a quarter of total global growth. Between 2011-2014, China’s economy will account for 24 percent, according to IMF estimates. </p><p> In comparison the US economy will only show an increase of 7.6 percent over the same period. </p><p> The predictions are hard to calculate as the latest estimates are based on purchasing power parity. The index attempts to assess the size of an economy based on the assumption that prices of non-tradable goods and services are a lot lower in poorer countries, says the Financial Times (FT). </p><p> The evaluation process of the service may differ, as a haircut in China may cost much less than in the US, however its quality may differ as well. </p><p> The same problem touches upon the quality of tangible goods. A DVD player bought in China may be way cheaper than a US one, however there is no warranty that it will last longer than several months. Besides US goods are sold with far more consumer protection laws, which through more scrutiny and inspection, delivers a better product. </p><p> Another barrier in measuring the true size of the economy is the availability of trusty data, as China is controlled by a secretive authoritarian government that sometimes manipulates data for political purposes. </p><p> It has a huge amount of illegal and unaccounted for ‘shadow’ income sourced from corruption, a sex industry, numerous illegal street vendors, and other services sectors that are not counted in official statistics. Therefore the ‘shadow’ economy could be more than 20 times bigger than official figures report. </p><p> The Chinese economy may be 20 percent larger than official figures show, this it may have overtaken the US several years ago, says the FT. </p><p> Meanwhile the living standards of the average Chinese citizen are still far lower than those in many developing countries. </p><p> According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s economy ranked 93 in per capita purchasing power parity terms. That was just ahead of Turkmenistan and Albania but well behind Libya, Azerbaijan and Surinam. </p><p> That means that on average China’s 1.36 billion people are unlikely to catch up with Western living standards for many decades to come. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155960-presenting-lies-facts-propaganda-exposure/</guid><title><![CDATA[Who's really 'presenting lies as facts'?

(...) Consider the way RT manipulated a leaked telephone <strong><u>call involving former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.</u></strong> Through selective editing, the network made it <strong><u>appear that Tymoshenko advocated violence against Russia.</u></strong> Or the <strong><u>constant reference to any Ukrainian opposed to a Russian takeover of the country as a "terrorist."</u></strong> Or the <strong><u>unquestioning repetition of the ludicrous assertion last week that the United States has invested $5 billion in regime change in Ukraine.</u></strong> <strong><u>These are not facts, and they are not opinions</u></strong>. They are false claims, and when propaganda poses as news it creates real dangers and gives a green light to violence.” </p><p> How many FACTS does Mr. Stengel attempt to deny? Let us count: </p><p> - Yulia Tymoshenko herself has <a href="http://rt.com/news/tymoshenko-calls-destroy-russia-917/">confirmed</a> the authenticity of the conversation that included the following statements: “This is really beyond all boundaries. It's about time we grab our guns and kill those damned Russians together with their leader.” And “I would have found a way to kill those a***es. I hope I will be able to get all my connections involved. And I will use all of my means to make the entire world rise up, so that there wouldn't be even a scorched field left in Russia.” While there was indeed some controversy about a small portion of the recording being altered, Ms. Tymoshenko herself pointed to the source of the tape, not RT, as the guilty party, and the statements quoted above were not in question. Bottom line: if it appears that Ms. Tymoshenko is advocating violence against Russia and Russians – it’s because she blatantly is. </p><p> - Forgetting for a second the absolutely ludicrous supposition, even in theory, of a Russian “takeover” of Ukraine, RT refers those supportive of the current authorities in Kiev as “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGfCLpjEUzk&amp;feature=youtu.be">anti-autonomy,” “pro-unity protesters</a>” and “<a href="http://rt.com/news/155224-ukraine-football-fans-clashes/">pro-Kiev activists</a>.” But you know who is keen on throwing around the “terrorist” moniker? Why, that would be the newly-minted, US-supported Ukrainian government, applying the term <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27035196">to its own people</a> (source: BBC News), as it sends tanks against the anti-government protesters – something that even President Yanukovich, for all his faults, refused to do. </p><p> - Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was the one to <a href="http://youtu.be/U2fYcHLouXY">publicize</a> the $5 billion “investment” in Ukraine’s “European future,” framing it in terms of the United States’ support of Ukraine achieving preconditions for “its European aspirations.” Interestingly enough, that “European future” and those “European aspirations” by definition blatantly ignored and/or rejected the aspirations of the 37 percent of Ukrainians who desired closer relationship with Russia via a trade union, as opposed to the 39 percent in favor of <a href="http://kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=204&amp;page=2"> joining the EU</a> (source: Kiev International Institute of Sociology). How much of that $5 billion went to support the institutions that aided <strong><u>their</u></strong> interests and how much support did Ms. Nuland et al. lend to the <strong><u>democratically</u></strong>-elected president who represented them? Right. Not that anyone is particularly surprised. Wouldn't be the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/04/03/the-big-problem-with-the-cuban-twitter-plan/"> first time</a> that the US benignly “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/bolivias-president-expels-us-aid-agency/2013/05/01/a290899e-b28b-11e2-baf7-5bc2a9dc6f44_story.html">invested</a>” in “democracy” (sources: Washington Post). </p><p> </p><p> Now, how does <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c6HQpH7zWQ">throwing Molotov cocktails</a> (source: Sky News), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkzi6-zz55M">savagely beating officers</a>, and <a href="http://rt.com/news/police-officer-savaged-ukraine-865/">refusing medical aid</a> to the injured while taking over government buildings fit into your definition of “peaceful protesters”? There was indeed brutality on both sides of the barricades (which RT thoroughly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhBk8V-6seo">documented and aired</a>), but you have admit – police officers don’t die by the hand of peaceful demonstrators. </p><p> How is RT behind the “protesters hired snipers” assertions if those concerns were brought to light by the famous leaked (and confirmed <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/05/world/europe/ukraine-leaked-audio-recording/"> authentic</a> – source: CNN) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEgJ0oo3OA8">Ashton-Paet call</a>, by quoting a Maidan medic whose credibility they went to pains to establish? The statement that “there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition” came not from RT but the Estonian minister. </p><p> And why is the far-right, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SBo0akeDMY">neo-Nazi</a> threat in Ukraine being so flippantly dismissed despite being <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/178013/ukrainian-nationalism-heart-euromaidan"> documented</a> by dozens of Western mainstream media <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/svoboda-ministers-ukraine-new-government-far-right"> outlets</a> (sources: BBC Newsnight, The Nation, Channel 4 UK)? </p><p> The reason you’re seeing citations of sources right here, in the text, is so that it cannot be labeled as another “propaganda” piece full of RT’s own “false” reporting. Or does Mr. Stengel consider all media organizations that report inconvenient facts that challenge his reality to be propaganda outlets? It is very disappointing that a person of his position knows so very little of the reality of the situation in Ukraine, but it certainly explains a lot about the state of US foreign policy. </p><p> Facts are facts, Mr. Stengel. It’s too bad you can’t get your own straight. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155932-elections-in-iraq-blasts/</guid><title><![CDATA[The first post-occupation election in Iraq started with explosions]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155932-elections-in-iraq-blasts/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/11/c0/00/elections-in-iraq-blasts.jpg" title="Sheik Qais Khazaali, leader of the militant group Asaib Ahl Haq, shows his ink-stained finger as he votes during a parliamentary election in Baghdad April 30, 2014.

(Reuters)" /> <p> Five polling stations in Baghdad, Sadr City and Mosul came under attack with varying consequences. The Iraqi Ministry of Interior reported six people killed and 24 injured, but the figures quickly changed to two dozen dead. </p><p> In the morning, the main polling station where security forces vote was crowded. No terrorist can make his way in here. It is in the government quarter close to the Green Zone, separated by concrete walls from the rest of the world. Since 2003, when the Baghdad municipality was destroyed by heavy bombardment, there have been only two ways to get around here: you either walk or you drive a tank. </p><p> For some reason, you are not allowed to take pictures of the graphic scars left by the US bombardment. In fact, the entire system of bans in Iraq is highly contradictory. The current authorities seem to have inherited the disposition for paradoxical prohibitions from the Saddam era. For example, many people would tell you that it was perfectly fine to go for a walk in this area and take any pictures you like. </p><p> Military officers did not look particularly alert or shocked by the deaths of their colleagues. Possibly, it is just not that easy to shock people in Iraq after all they have been through. Under US occupation, 180,000 Iraqis were killed, 150,000 were widowed, 120,000 were orphaned. Even the most pro-American Iraqis think that the lists kept by activists at <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/" target="_blank">database</a> are accurate. In fact, everybody who trusts this organization and uses their figures would tell you that the death toll is actually ten times higher – and this is really scary. </p><p> </p><p> Notepads, cameras and chargers are the things that interest security personnel the most in a journalist’s bag. When I turned my spare battery on and a blue LED light began to blink, a fully veiled female guard searching me ran out of the tent to get the senior officer. When we explained to her that it was only a battery, she immediately stopped hollering and began to apologize with as much zeal. </p><p> Soldiers and officers from different units and in different uniforms kept coming in small groups, taking pictures of each other, taking pictures with me and asking for my Facebook account in order to become Facebook friends with me and post the photo. </p><p> At every checkpoint, they <em>“check”</em> your papers. My green international ID card worked fine in every instance. When I went into the polling station, they wrote down my name in a thick register and gladly demonstrated the voting procedure to me. </p><p> The polling station is set up in a school building. There were long lines to each of the classrooms, and senior officers waited in them just like ordinary soldiers. There was no segregation; on the contrary, there was an atmosphere of camaraderie. After voting, each platoon would take a group picture showing their inky index fingers. </p><p> Contrary to expectations, not all the military voted for the ruling bloc. They were more than willing to explain why they voted for the candidates they voted for. </p><p> What was even more contrary to the view dominating the media is that there were Sunnis among the military who voted for the bloc of the Shiite leader al-Sadr. </p><p> Rayad is not just a Sunni; he is a Sunni from Fallujah, which is currently seized by terrorist groups – al Qaeda and ISIS, Iraqis say. Rayad is the only Sunni in his unit, and he has Shiites under his command. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“The reason I vote for Sadr is not just because he is a good man. He protects everybody regardless of which group they belong to,”</em> Rayad tells me. Most of the people in his police squad vote for al-Sadr, not for al-Maliki’s ruling Shiite bloc. </p><p> The bloc of Muqtada al-Sadr who started a Shiite rebellion against US occupation in Najaf in 2004 runs against the ruling bloc of al-Maliki. It has 40 seats in the parliament and 6 ministerial positions in the government. </p><p> Rayad tells me about his hometown, Fallujah, which is famous for rebelling twice against US occupation in 2004. Now it has been seized by the radicals fighting <em>“infidels,”</em> as they refer to Shiites. </p><p> <em>“Those terrorist groups started their raids seven months ago. They use hit-and-run tactics. There are people from all over the world among them – Syria, Turkey, even Tunisia. I’ve never seen them myself but I know people who have. They quickly move around the city, and they have plenty of weapons. Most residents, including my family, have moved to Baghdad. They just left one man from each family to take care of their houses but it is impossible for the families to remain there,”</em> Rayad says. </p><p> Golsham Kamal Ali, the head of the PR department of the Independent High Electoral Commission, says that the terrorists attacked five polling stations where the servicemen voted. Other than that, she believes, the voting has begun well, and the servicemen are prepared for these attacks in any case. </p><p> A police unit wearing a different kind of uniform walks into the school yard. They have all voted for al-Maliki. <em>“I think he’s the right person for the job, he deserves it. He always acts sensibly, and I respect him”</em>, one of the policemen readily explains. </p><p> </p><p> His fellow policemen are all from Baghdad. They all say their families voted for al-Maliki as well. One of the policemen protests and says he voted for al-Sadr. Many Iraqis are particularly enthusiastic about the elections, because no one makes them cast their votes and they can vote against the ruling regime. They don’t really think about what they’ll get from that. </p><p> <em>“We may be certain that al-Maliki wins and stays in office. He suits both Americans and Iraqis, and these are the two groups that determine everything in Iraq now”</em>. This sentiment has now been repeated by everyone who’s so enthusiastic about the election process that they aren’t even hoping for any kind of change. </p><p> On Tuesday morning a curfew was imposed in some of the Bagdad districts, and access to the city will be restricted before the main voting day on April, 30. </p><p> This is the first post-occupation election in Iraq. There are about 9,000 candidates, one quarter of them women, running for 325 seats in the Parliament. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155868-europe-exports-china-military/</guid><title><![CDATA[EU states strike lucrative military contracts with China overriding embargo - report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155868-europe-exports-china-military/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0d/c0/00/europe-exports-china-military.jpg" title="Helicopters fly past the Chinese Jiangwei II class naval frigate &quot;Luoyang&quot; (Reuters/Guang Niu)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 14:14:26 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0d/c0/00/europe-exports-china-military.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Europe is powering the military rise of China, approving multi-million dollar deals for the transfer of weapons and dual-use technology – despite an arms embargo stemming from the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, AFP reveals.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0d/c0/00/europe-exports-china-military.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Helicopters fly past the Chinese Jiangwei II class naval frigate "Luoyang" (Reuters/Guang Niu)" /> <p> China is the world’s second largest military spender and the fastest growing military market, with Beijing setting aside $132 billion in defense spending. While they are yet to touch the US’ massive $495.6 billion defense budget, China recently announced they would increase military spending by 12.2 percent for 2014. </p><p> <em>“It will take China a long, long time before its budgets will effectively alter the military balance with the US,”</em> Jonathan Holslag of the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China Studies, recently told Stars and Stripes. </p><p> <em>“But that’s not the main concern. While the US still has some scope to respond, neighbors are getting much more nervous… Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines all know that they could be the first victim if the balance of power shifts at America’s detriment.”</em> </p><p> Although Western partners in the East are skittish about China’s rise, Europe seemingly cannot resist the allure of Beijing’s billions. </p><p> </p><p> French designed helicopters bolstering China’s air force, British jet engines driving fighter bombers and anti-ship strike aircraft, German and French engines providing the rudder to the Chinese navy – the role European exports play in China’s military is undeniable. </p><p> <em>“Without European technology, the Chinese navy would not be able to move,"</em> Andrei Chang, editor of the Hong Kong-based Kanwa Asian Defense Review, told AFP. </p><p> EU weapons manufactures received licenses to export equipment worth three billion euros ($4.1 billion) to China in the decade to 2012, annual EU reports on trade reveal. </p><p> The most recent document said arms exports totaling 173 million euros were given the green light in 2012, 80 percent of which were issued by France. A French parliamentary report said the country delivered arms to China worth 104 million euros. </p><blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> The PLA consists of four main service branches: the Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps. The total PLA forces hovers at just under 2.3 million. Currently, the Chinese nuclear stockpile is estimated at between 50 and 75 land and sea based ICBM's. The country is believed to have approximately 9,150 tanks. They also are in possession of an estimated 4,788 armored fighting vehicles and 1,770 multiple-launch rocket systems. The country’s air power consists of 2,788 aircraft, including 1,170 fighters, 885 fixed-wing attack aircraft, and 856 helicopters. China has 76 Sukhoi Su-27 air superiority fighters, another 73 Sukhoi Su-30MKK multirole fighters, and 165 domestically manufactured Shenyang J-11 air fighters. China also boasts 1 aircraft carrier, a 520 vessel strong navy including 45 frigates, 24 destroyers, 9 corvettes, and 69 submarines. </p> </blockquote><p> <em>“Already, cynics claim that if the People’s Liberation Army went to war tomorrow, it would employ an arsenal filled with equipment from Germany, France and Britain,"</em> Emil Kirchner, an EU policy expert at Britain's University of Essex, told said. </p><h2> Are exports legal with embargo in place? </h2><p> The European Union imposed an arms embargo on China following the killing of hundreds, if not thousands of protesters during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Analysts, however, say EU states have free will to interpret the embargo as they choose, a reality which has generated tension with the United States. </p><p> An EU spokesman said in a statement that <em>"the final decision to authorize or deny the (arms) export is the responsibility of EU member states."</em> </p><p> The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which monitors arms transfers, estimates that France, Britain and Germany account for 18 percent of Chinese military imports. Russia still provides the bulk of military hardware exports to China. </p><p> At the heart of China’s military modernization is its powerful new submarine fleet, which relies on state-of-the-art diesel engines designed by MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH of Friedrichshafen, Germany. </p><p> For Western states, these exports can impact the security of their allies. In January 2013, tensions nearly boiled over after a Jiangwei-class Chinese frigate locked fire-control radar on a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense destroyer and a helicopter near the disputed Senkaku/ Diaoyu Islands. </p><p> Military experts believe the ship relies on diesel engines produced by German firm MTU, AFP reports. </p><p> Another Chinese ship, a Jiangkai-class vessel, uses engines made by SEMT Pielstick, a French diesel engine manufacturer owned by German firm MAN Diesel and Turbo, according to analysts and specifications posted on Chinese military websites. </p><p> </p><p> MAN told AFP that its Chinese licensees have supplied about 250 engines to China's navy. MTU said it <em>"acts strictly according to the German export laws,</em>" without elaborating. </p><p> Meanwhile, in March Airbus Helicopters and China’s Avicopter – the helicopter business unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) – penned a joint agreement for the production of 1,000 new generation EC175/AC352 rotorcraft at the Elysée Palace in Paris. Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Francois Hollande were present for the signing. </p><p> Citing the co-production deal signed in France, Chang said: <em>"China uses the name of civil purchase to purchase French helicopter engines, and they shift those engines into military helicopters.</em> </p><p> <em>If (China) knows how to design the middle-sized EC175, they will know how to design a middle-sized military transport helicopter.”</em> </p><p> Meanwhile, the Netherlands is also behind 18 million euros' worth of "vessels of war" or their accessories and components, while the acquisition of a British-made Airborne Early Warning (AEW) platform for the latest Chinese surveillance aircraft has provided a boost to the People’s Liberation Army Air Force. </p><p> The Chinese defense ministry has previously said reports of the People’s Liberation Army dependence on foreign arms technology are exaggerated. <em>"According to international practice, China is also engaged in communication and cooperation with some countries in the area of weaponry development,"</em> the ministry said in a statement responding to this series. <em>"Some people have politicized China's normal commercial cooperation with foreign countries, smearing our reputation."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155904-ukraine-economy-crisis-q1/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pain for Ukraine: Economy loses 1.1 percent in Q1]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155904-ukraine-economy-crisis-q1/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/00/00/2ukraine-economy-crisis-q1.jpg" title="Reuters/Gleb Garanich"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:52:15 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/10/00/00/2ukraine-economy-crisis-q1.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine’s economy contracted 1.1 percent in the first three months of 2014, Ukraine’s Statistical Service reported Wednesday. This poor performance puts the economy on track to slow 4 percent overall in 2014.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/00/00/2ukraine-economy-crisis-q1.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Gleb Garanich" /> <p> The preliminary estimate compares to a 1.2 percent drop in the same 3-month period in 2013, and a 2 percent GDP fall in the fourth quarter, data also provided by Ukraine's <a href="http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/Noviny/new2014/zmist/21_u.htm" target="_blank">Statistics Office</a>. There was zero growth in 2013, and the IMF has forecast a 4 percent contraction in 2014. </p><p> The past few months have been tumultuous times for Ukraine, which has been the epicenter of violent protests that reveal the deep political divide between the West and East. In February, a provisional government took control of Kiev in the course of events viewed as a coup in Russia. Presidential elections will be held May 25. </p><p> But Ukraine’s economy had been headed towards default long before Maidan protests began in November 2013 when then-President Viktor Yanukovich refused to sign a trade agreement with the European Union. </p><p> Gold and foreign exchange reserves are quickly depleting, and currently stand at $12 billion. In February, before the coup-appointed government took power, reserves had reached a critical level of $18 billion. In 2013, more than $4 billion in international reserves were wiped out. </p><p> Reserves are nearly gone because Ukraine’s Central Bank has spent billions on currency intervention to prop up the sinking hryvnia, which has depreciated 28 percent against the dollar this year. </p><p> The sliding hryvnia is also adding pressure on government solvency, as over a half of Ukraine’s debt is denominated in foreign currency. </p><p> Inflation is expected to continue to rise, with the IMF predicting 12 percent in 2014. </p><p> The Ukrainian Central Bank is also tapping into the country’s reserves to pay off the country’s fast-accumulating debt. </p><p> Finance Minister Vitaliy Lisovenko said the government has $9 billion in foreign-currency debt payments this year. </p><p> The country owes at least <a href="http://rt.com/business/gas-war-ukraine-russia-845/" target="_blank">$2.2 billion</a> to Russia’s Gazprom, but says this obligation will not be a priority. State-owned Naftogaz is on the brink of bankruptcy, because it has been selling gas domestically for only a fraction of the import price. </p><p> A Eurobond sale could help stabilize the financial situation, Deputy Finance Minister Vitaliy Lisovenko said Friday April 25. The Eurobond sale would be under a US guarantee. </p><h2> ‘Help’ on the way </h2><p> Ukraine is waiting for a final loan figure from the International Monetary Fund, a package expected to be upwards of <a href="http://rt.com/business/imf-ukraine-financial-help-105/" target="_blank">$18 billion</a>. Details on the package are expected to be announced today. The first tranche will come in May. </p><p> An additional $750 million from the World Bank, 600 million euro from the European Union, and $100 million from Japan in aid will make its way to Kiev. The US has also promised <a href="http://rt.com/business/congress-approves-aid-ukraine-881/" target="_blank">$1 billion</a> in loan guarantees to help the collapsing Ukraine economy. However, so far these are just promises and no physical funds have been transferred to torn apart Ukraine. </p><p> <em>"Of course we need a fully fledged agreement with the IMF but the European Union is ready for macro-financial aid in the framework of the overall package. So we are ready to support Ukraine,"</em> European Council President Herman Van Rompuy told reporters Wednesday. </p><p> In December, Russia provided Ukraine with a <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-15-billion-gas-381/" target="_blank">$15 billion</a> ‘no-strings-attached’ loan, but so far, the West hasn’t delivered on any of its promises to help Ukraine. </p><p> Under the terms of the Russia-Ukraine deal signed in December, Ukraine's debt shouldn’t exceed 60 percent of GDP. This means that technically Russia has the right to demand the money back before the bonds are due in 2015. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155916-america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[US-Russia relations need a return to reason]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155916-america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/c0/00/america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Reuters)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:44:34 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/c0/00/america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The second wave of US sanctions against Russian officials and the heated rhetoric exchange between the leaders of both countries, with each side blaming the other, show without a doubt that US-Russia relations have bottomed out.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/c0/00/america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Reuters)" /> <p> It is time to abandon political posturing and introduce some rationality to the discussion. The stakes are too high to allow this confrontation between Washington and Moscow to continue, as the consequences are unpredictable. </p><p> The violent chaos spreading in Ukraine has the potential to spark a much wider conflict in Europe on a scale not seen since 1945. The expansion of NATO military hardware and personnel along Russia's borders and the threats of further devastating Western sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy are pushing us towards a nightmare scenario that neither the US nor its European allies are prepared to face. </p><p> A certain modicum of cynicism and hypocrisy is perhaps unavoidable in foreign policy, but choosing to overlook any of the interim Kiev government's wrongdoings, and blaming every instance of violence on Russian provocateurs exceeds these limits – or, to borrow from US President Barack Obama's parlance, crosses every red line. </p><p> It is true that some opposing views occasionally penetrate the Western media's wall of anti-Russian consensus, but their numbers are as few as those of Soviet-era dissidents in a KGB-dominated state. </p><p> The recent Geneva agreement was a step in the right direction, but it has not changed the untenable situation on the ground. The real question now is who is going to put it into effect? </p><p> For example, Kiev has not followed through on its promise to disarm illegally armed militant groups – such as the nationalist Right Sector paramilitary group – which was one of the vital points of the Geneva deal. Nor does it show any inclination that it will do so any time soon. </p><p> The greatest danger here is that Ukraine is edging closer and closer toward a full-scale civil war by the day. But there is an even greater danger of the conflict escalating into a direct military confrontation between US-led NATO forces and Russia, a scenario with the most horrific consequences for both sides. </p><p> A NATO intervention in Ukraine, followed by a reciprocal move by Russia, is not a desirable outcome. Therefore, as tensions rise and the conditions in Ukraine continue to deteriorate, policymakers in Washington and Moscow need to recognize the extremely urgent need to find a means of extricating themselves from this crisis. This should be done before it transforms from a regional crisis to a full-blown international conflagration. </p><p> During a recent interview, President Vladimir Putin offered Washington an opportunity to break this futile cycle of mutual accusation and ineffectual posturing. <em>"I think there is nothing that would hinder normalization and normal cooperation with the West. This does not depend on us, or rather not only on us. This depends on our partners,"</em> said Putin. In the same interview he welcomed the appointment of former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg as the next NATO secretary-general. </p><p> Regardless of your opinion of Putin, since first taking office 15 years ago he has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness and ability to constructively cooperate with the US on major issues. Even today, crucial US air supplies to the NATO-backed security forces in Afghanistan are made easier by Russia, which provides secure access via its Northern Air Corridor. Both nations share the same security concerns with regard to the spread of nuclear weapons and terror threats from radical Islamists. </p><p> To be sure, it is Washington that holds practically all the keys to a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. Not only has it helped to install the present government but, judging from the incessant visits of senior US officials to Kiev, it is they who are calling the shots. </p><p> Kiev's actions, paired with Washington's threat of additional sanctions and failure to push for a compromise by implementing the Geneva agreement, raise the fears that we are quickly moving toward a situation that both sides might end up deeply regretting. </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Edward Lozansky and Martin Sieff for RT</span></em> </p><p> <span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);"><em>Edward Lozansky is President of the American University in Moscow</em></span> </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Martin Sieff is a Senior Fellow of the American University in Moscow</span></em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155784-twitter-posts-132m-loss/</guid><title><![CDATA[Twitter’s $132bn Q1 loss sends shares tumbling more than 11%]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155784-twitter-posts-132m-loss/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/08/80/00/twitter-postsm-loss.jpg" title="Reuters/Brendan McDermid"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:43:54 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/08/80/00/twitter-postsm-loss.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Shares in the social network Twitter have fallen 11.1 percent on market opening in New York on Wednesday after the company announced disappointing first quarter results.

In comparison, the same period last year the company posted a $27 million loss , according to the company’s financial <a href="https://investor.twitterinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=843245" target="_blank">statement</a>. </p><p> Even a sharp increase in advertising revenue didn’t help Twitter make a profit. </p><p> Company revenue more than doubled to $250 million, up from $114 million in the first quarter of 2013, which beat the company’s own forecast and analysts' expectations. Advertising generated $226 million with 80 percent coming from mobile. </p><p> "<em>We had a very strong first quarter. Revenue growth accelerated on a year over year basis fueled by increased engagement and user growth,</em>" said Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter. </p><p> "<em>We also continue to rapidly increase our reach and scale. With the integration of MoPub, we now reach more than 1 billion iOS and Android users each month, making us one of the largest in-app mobile ad exchanges in the world and the only one at scale to offer native in-app advertising</em>," Costolo concluded. </p><p> Twitter, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange last November, says it has 255 million average monthly active users (MAU) as of March 31, a 25 percent year-over-year increase. The MAU growth appears to be falling as at the end of the last quarter the number of the active blogs increased by 30 percent. </p><p> "<em>They need to prove that they can be a very large-sized platform," the Economic Times quotes Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with investment firm Sterne Agee. "Can they get to 500, 600 million users worldwide?

WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook <a href="http://rt.com/business/facebook-buys-messaging-whatsapp-814/" target="_blank">bought</a> for $19bn, recently passed the 500 million user milestone. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155924-nato-mission-eastern-europe/</guid><title><![CDATA[Mission uncertain: Canadian planes leave for Eastern Europe to assist NATO]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155924-nato-mission-eastern-europe/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/11/40/00/nato-mission-eastern-europe.jpg" title="Canadian Forces CF-18 fighter jets (Reuters/Cpl Pierre Habib/Canadian Armed Forces)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:10:59 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/11/40/00/nato-mission-eastern-europe.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Six CF-18s and hundreds of Canadian Forces personnel left for Romania to help NATO forces in Eastern Europe amid uncertainty over the scope of the mission.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/11/40/00/nato-mission-eastern-europe.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Canadian Forces CF-18 fighter jets (Reuters/Cpl Pierre Habib/Canadian Armed Forces)" /> <p> It is the biggest deployment of military aircraft to Romania from another NATO member since the Ukraine crisis broke out. </p><p> <em>"There is a lot of uncertainty about what we're going to be doing over there,"</em> Lieutenant-General Yvan Blondin said at a press conference with Defense Minister Rob Nicholson in Bagotville, where the CF-18 Hornets are based. </p><p> Blondin mentioned that the troops were going to perhaps participate in routine training exercises – but he is still not sure what the mission will involve. </p><p> <em>"We're not sure how long we're going to be staying, but we'll be staying until the government tells us it's time to come back,"</em> Blondin said. </p><p> Six fighters have set off, accompanied by a C-17 cargo plane carrying spare parts, tools and mechanical equipment. </p><p> The fighters first headed to Iceland before receiving further direction from Department of National Defense's Central Command on where they will be stationed in Romania, which borders Ukraine. </p><p> All in all, up to 250 Canadian military personnel are set to be deployed for the NATO mission. </p><p> Almost two weeks ago, it was announced that 6 RCAF CF-18 fighter jets would join the NATO mission in response to the Ukraine crisis. </p><p> <em>"We are sending out a message to Russia and we are reassuring our allies that we are taking steps and making a point consistent with what NATO has been saying, the actions so far are unacceptable by Russia and we are sending out a very clear message,"</em> Defense Minister Rob Nicholson told CBC News. </p><p> Just a couple of days ago, UK and France deployed eight fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland to strengthen NATO air defenses. </p><p> Polish and British air force contingents began patrolling the space over the Baltic States on Wednesday. The patrol is set to last for four months, reports ITAR-TASS.

He also underlined the fact that those actions are accompanied by provocative statements by NATO’s Secretary General about the need to withhold Russia,”</em> the statement from the Defense Ministry said. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155912-us-sanctions-against-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Sanctions: The sanctimonious solution]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155912-us-sanctions-against-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/80/00/us-sanctions-against-russia.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama (Reuters/Larry Downing)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:05:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/80/00/us-sanctions-against-russia.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />As Moscow withdrew its troops from the border with Ukraine, President Obama announced further sanctions against Russian politicians and businessmen to a chorus of economists gleefully predicting the havoc to be wrought on the Russian economy.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/80/00/us-sanctions-against-russia.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama (Reuters/Larry Downing)" /> <p> Of course, there’s not much evidence that sanctions have every actually achieved anything beyond making life difficult for lesser or greater numbers of people. Furthermore, the entire idea runs counter to the creed of global market liberalization so openly embraced by the very people who support slapping sanctions on anyone who indicates that they may not be in complete accord with them on each and every topic under the sun. </p><p> The World Trade Organization (WTO), for example, was supposed to prevent nations from using their economies as a tool in the service of their own political interests. This has long served as the rationale for the WTO’s limited consideration of social rights or the environment when rendering its decisions. </p><p> In the world of international law, sanctions are therefore a bit passé, really. They may have sounded like a good idea 20 years ago, but we’ve all moved on since then. </p><p> Thus, the idea that the USA and Europe are somehow going to bludgeon Russia into submission using a tool that much-more-vulnerable Cuba has blithely held out against for over half a century, is at first glance, worth a laugh. After all, it’s an open secret that the only country the US has managed to isolate with its sanctions has long been itself. In fact, before Gaddafi was ousted in 2011, the United States was – thanks to the long-standing Pan-Am controversy – virtually the only country that wasn’t getting oil concessions out of Libya. </p><p> Much has been said about the overweening arrogance sanctioning Russia displays Max Keiser’s <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/155120-living-behind-cnn-curtain/" target="_blank">article</a> earlier this week was particularly interesting, especially since it hasn’t been possible to portray these sanctions as the usual punishment for not having a <em>‘democratic’</em> government. Are Western leaders really so out of touch that they think Russia will give in because it is being sanctioned by the US and Europe? </p><p> I doubt it. </p><p> There’s a deeper game here and it is as follows: 1) sanctioning Russia makes it look like Western leaders are actually doing something (thereby satisfying public opinion at home); 2) if I were a betting woman, I would put money on it coming out someday that these sanctions were laid down in a manner curiously advantageous to certain Western businesses; 3) as far as Western leaders are concerned it isn’t Russia that is the problem, it’s Putin. I think they’ve gotten the message that Putin is not the <em>‘caving in’</em> type. So rather than get him to back down, they’d probably rather just get rid of him. Hence the litany of complaints personally directed against Putin over the past several months. </p><p> It might surprise many Russians to learn that a large segment of the North American population believes that Vladimir Putin is an unelected dictator and that they are paranoid of being put under surveillance by him. I understand that you may need to read that twice to take it all in. Most people react to my telling them that I write for RT as if I have just announced that I have a license to kill. </p><p> But difficult as it is, try to see things from the point of view of your average Western power-broker. They can remember the good old times, when Yeltsin was in charge (using that term loosely) and Russia was an investment bonanza, a real <em>“free market”</em>, plentiful in crony capitalism with minimal social security and all the natural resources you can take. </p><p> They would like that back. </p><p> And after that, they would like a similar arrangement in China, please. </p><p> Once that is accomplished everyone will finally be on the same wavelength and the world will be remarkably conflict-free. It wouldn’t matter so much where Ukraine chose to make its political and economic alliances, because under this scenario the money would all be flowing into the same pockets, anyway and at a rate rapid enough to keep everyone satisfied. </p><p> </p><p> And Western leaders think that they have a certain chance of getting Part 1 of their policy taken care of, because they are hoping that if they can cause the Russian economy to tank, it will eventually, when the dust has settled, hit Putin’s popularity so hard as to hurt his chances of re-election. This is a basic tactic that is used a lot in international negotiations. It’s played by getting anyone you think is a tough negotiator removed from their job by spreading misinformation about them back to their home government or simply outright demanding that the home government sack them in order for negotiations to proceed at all. </p><p> You can see both of these tactics at play in regards to Putin at the moment. I’m all for a healthy dose of criticism in domestic politics, but Russia as spy state using covert operations to topple governments while simultaneously placing us all under surveillance sounds a lot like Western leaders just cobbled together everyone’s complaints about them and hurled them at the new/old arch-enemy. Classic misinformation. </p><p> Sanctions are an example of tactic two: I don’t like you so I’m not going to deal with you. If your country wants to talk to me they have to send someone with a better attitude, which means someone who thinks that the word ‘negotiation’ means that we do whatever I want. People sometimes wonder at the high proportion of idiots given government posts. Now you know. If you have a backbone, your survival chances decrease dramatically, because you get hit-listed. </p><p> Consider further that this kind of aggressive action is necessary for Western leaders, because their backs are already against the wall. Their own constituents are fed-up to levels that haven’t been seen since the 1960s, with inequality growing daily. The largest political parties have already decided that they are in the game for themselves, with few differences to speak of between their policies. Thus, they only have two choices – continue going with whatever policies suit their wealthy campaign backers or do an about-face and start compromising with <em>‘the people’</em>. </p><p> Needless to say, that would burn the bridge with campaign financiers, and since that relationship has been ongoing for a very long time, taking the plunge to change things around seems like a pretty big risk. So no one does it, and they just continue doing what they’ve done for the last 20 years, which is to try to steamroll everything in their path. </p><p> This is the real logic behind sanctions: an attempt to make the Russian leadership unpopular with its own businesses and citizens to the point that a more conciliatory party and leader are elected. No easy task, clearly, since imposing sanctions which exclusively hit Russia involves a fair bit of cherry-picking. </p><p> Western politicians seem determined to follow this course to the bitter end rather than acknowledge that their own political interests may not be the only ones on Earth or that we might be under some sort of obligation to negotiate with the elected leaders of other nations. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155908-ukraine-drills-kiev-military/</guid><title><![CDATA[State Guard, police to take part in Kiev night drill – mayor]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155908-ukraine-drills-kiev-military/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/40/00/ukraine-drills-kiev-military.jpg" title="Reuters/Valentyn Ogirenko"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 12:20:18 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/10/40/00/ukraine-drills-kiev-military.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine’s State Guard and police units are to hold a civil protection drill in Kiev on Wednesday night, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital said.

Their deployment in the city’s center is not expected,”</em> the statement added. <br><br> Later on Wednesday, Kiev's Mayor Vladimir Bondareko appeared on Ukrainian television to clarify the situation. <br><br> He stated that only troops from the State Guard and Interior Ministry – not the army – would be taking part in the night drill. <br><br><em>"Today we are working with units...which must protect the population in case of certain events. So, today we’ll try to train the movement of these units. They will arrive in of Pechersk district (a historical neighborhood in central Kiev), where the government institutions are situated, and then return to their bases,”</em> Bondareko said. <br><br> The mayor explained that the exercises are vital due to the events taking place in southeastern Ukraine. Protests against the coup-imposed Ukrainian government are on the rise in the region, with anti-Kiev activists seizing administrative buildings and demanding a referendum on federalization. <br><br> "We must be ready for everything, and Kiev’s city administration is doing all it can that if, God forbid, something happens, we’ll be able to hide in shelters and get water; so that we knew where to go for medical aid,” he stressed. </p><p> Earlier Ukraine’s coup-appointed President Aleksandr Turchinov announced that the army is now in a state of high alert due to the "<em>real threat</em>" of a Russian military invasion. </p><p> At the same time he admitted that Kiev cannot control the situation in the east of Ukraine, where anti-government protesters are continuing to take over government buildings. </p><p> The clashes on Tuesday night happened between an ultra-nationalist Social-National Assembly, a faction of the Right Sector militant group and members of the Maidan self-defense militia, as the nationalists were holding a torch rally through central Kiev. </p><p> Many Ukrainian nationalists are appalled by the Ukrainian government’s failure to crackdown on the eastern Ukrainian protest. Some even call for another change at the top. </p><p> Some Ukrainian officials branded the torch rally as a provocation inspired by Russia, although no explanation was given as to how Russia could have any influence on that group. </p><p> Ukraine’s central authorities previously tried to use the military against the protesters in the east, but this proved to be inefficient. The morale of the troops is low, and there were cases of some soldiers defecting to the protesters instead of fighting against them. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155884-juice-news-israel-palestine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Juice News: Mid-East Peace malady (ft.

(AFP Photo)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What do you make of Kerry's taking back his comments on the apartheid character of Israel and what does it say about the US commitment to the peace process and two-state solution?</em> </p><p> <strong>Nabil Shaath:</strong> I think the US is committed to a two-state solution and it remains committed to some peace process, but they realize that it is very difficult to get anything done with the present Israeli government. The last 9 month were frustrating - the Israeli government today does not believe in any of the international commitments that it made before in the Oslo agreement, in the road map, in Napoli and many other places, starting in Madrid in 1991. Therefore it is very difficult really to reach the two-states solution when Israelis are eating up the occupied territory in the West Bank and they are really treating us [Palestinians] like the [black] South Africans were treated during the apartheid system. It is very difficult really to have a peace process. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong><em>What about US diplomacy that can’t be honest with its partner in trying to find a solution?</em> </p><p> <strong>NS:</strong> The US Secretary of State has his commitments and has his diplomatic language. Once in a while I think it becomes very frustrating, so he expresses the truth and then finds it very difficult to swallow. This is not the first time that it’s happened… if you recall in 1991 at the Madrid conference, President Bush, and Foreign Secretary James Baker took a harsh position against Mr. Shamir and in fact withdrew $10 billion of loan guarantees that the US committed to give to Israel in order to get Israel to move on the peace process and to go to the Madrid conference. I think it’s the responsibility of the US to do so… not only to put pressure on the Palestinians. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>A deal was struck recently among rival factions, Hamas and Fatah. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group. How can the peace process go forward with Hamas unwilling to recognize Israel?</em> </p><p> <strong>NS:</strong> It’s very ironic that Mr Netanyahu said this, while he has in his cabinet people like Naftali Bennett and others who totally negate the peace process, totally negate any commitment to the process and who very clearly declare their extreme positions on never accepting a Palestinian state. If you really look at the way the Israeli army has been dealing with our people and the settlers have been dealing with our people, during these negotiations 60 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli army or settlers. If Mr Netanyahu wants peace he has to accept the Palestinian people together, in one package, in one state. He has no the right to divide Palestinians. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>But if you struck a deal between Hamas and Fatah, then any sort of peace process will be delayed because of Israel’s reaction. Couldn’t those factions have postponed joining together?</em> </p><p> <strong>NS:</strong> No, we have to unite our people because the Israelis have been telling us we cannot negotiate with you if you do not represent Gaza, if you represent only the West Bank we cannot have peace with all the Palestinians. And now they say the contrary: <em>“If you have Gaza and the West Bank together, we don’t want peace with you.”</em> The unity we are seeking with Hamas is a democratic unity that will be based on elections and the Palestinian people will decide, and there are commitments that we have made that we will keep and there is the constitution of the PNA [Palestinian National Authority] that has made peace with Israelis that will be kept. But it’s the Palestinian people who will decide that in the elections. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155896-kerry-blames-eu-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Kerry rebuked EU for inciting Ukraine ‘tug of war’– report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155896-kerry-blames-eu-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/80/00/kerry-blames-eu-ukraine.jpg" title="Anti-government protesters detain a policeman (2nd L) during clashes in the Independence Square in Kiev February 20, 2014.

(Reuters/Yannis Behrakis)" /> <p> <em>“Some folks in Europe made mistakes, the association agreement became too much of an East-West tug of war. It shouldn’t have been,”</em> US Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly said at a private meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Washington last Friday. His words were quoted by the Daily Beast on Tuesday. </p><p> Russia has long insisted that the EU and the US sparked the political crisis in Ukraine last October. The EU Association Agreement, which President Viktor Yanukovich refused to sign after long deliberation, would require Ukraine to sever or downgrade many of its economic ties with Russia, which would hurt greatly its economy. Yanukovich’s decision triggered the protest in Kiev, which eventually escalated into an armed coup that deposed him. </p><p> European and American officials rejected Russia’s view of the ill-fated agreement, insisting it would not damage Ukraine’s trade with Russia. But apparently in private conversation American diplomats don’t follow the narrative. </p><p> The division between the US and the EU over Ukraine was highlighted earlier in February after a recording of a phone conversation between Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and American Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt <a href="http://rt.com/news/nuland-phone-chat-ukraine-927/" target="_blank">was leaked</a>. </p><p> They were discussing the foreign effort to help anti-Yanukovich opposition create what has now became the new Ukrainian government and expressed frustration at EU’s hesitance on the matter, culminated by the infamous “F**k the EU” exclamation from Nuland. </p><p> </p><p> Kerry’s private comment on the EU’s role in the crisis is just a small part of the Daily Beast report. The majority was focused on the alleged evidence that the US had of Russian agents acting in Ukraine to stir up protest. While the website initially implied that the evidence had been recorded by US intelligence, the State Department later clarified that the reported remarks were related to recordings produced by the Ukrainian government. </p><p> Kiev published a six-minute recording, which it said proved the presence of Russian secret agents in Ukraine, two weeks ago. This was one day after a disastrous attack on protester-held Slavyansk, in which then-head of the Anti-Terrorist Center of the Ukrainian Security Service was injured. However, the evidence was far from conclusively damning for Russia. </p><p> Another package of evidence Ukraine produced so far, which the US State Department endorsed, proved to be faulty. The alleged photo evidence case quickly collapsed, with the New York Times, which headlined it, having to publish a follow-up <a href="http://rt.com/news/154548-pictures-russian-troops-false/" target="_blank">admitting</a> its failure to properly verify it. </p><p> Following Kerry’s previous remarks on the alleged Russian involvement in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov <a href="http://rt.com/news/154832-russian-agents-ukraine-lavrov/" target="_blank">challenged</a> his counterpart to produce any real proof. </p><p> <em>“Kerry has many times mentioned that Ukrainian intelligence captured Russian agents,”</em> he said. <em>“So, show them to the people, have them on TV. Kerry says they don’t want to disclose the identities of those people who are engaged in the captures. This is not serious.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155832-elections-in-iraq-security-sectarianism/</guid><title><![CDATA[Iraq election could bring Sunni and Shia reconciliation]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155832-elections-in-iraq-security-sectarianism/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0b/80/00/elections-in-iraq-security-sectarianism.jpg" title="A fully-veiled woman shows her ink-stained finger at a polling station during voting for Iraqi parliamentary election in Baghdad April 30, 2014.

(Reuters)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>This is the worst violence Iraq has seen in several years. Why do the government's efforts to contain it seem to be failing?</em> </p><p> <strong>Jake Diliberto:</strong> The Iraqi government is suffering from a couple of different things that penetrate its society inside the government and in the day-to-day life of Iraqis. Basically there have been about a hundred years of sectarian divide between the Sunnis and the Shias… it’s going back to the founding of state in the 1920s. As a result, this political tension, even after the US intervention in 2003, has still found a way to permeate society and increase violence. The reason that the government is ineffective is because of long-term traditional problems within the sectarian communities and also because of US inability to bring political results after the post-2003 invasion. So a combination of the two – history and US intervention. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>You fought in the Iraq war. Do you think the invasion helped the country in any way, and what is your view on military interventions in general?</em> </p><div class="cont-wp advance-extra"> <blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> On April 30 Iraq is holding its first ever parliamentary elections since the withdrawal of US troops. However, the sectarian tensions in the country are extremely high, while Iraq itself is a fragmented state, and these facts do affect the ongoing voting. Though security level was increased significantly, the two days before elections were shaded by a wave of deadly attacks. </p> </blockquote> </div><p> <strong>JD:</strong> It’s funny to look at the modern security environment that Iraq faces, and Syria and Lebanon face…. it’s increasingly apparent that third party interventions are not working out for the benefit of Iraqis, Syrians, and Lebanese. These kinds of sectarian solutions need to come from within, they need to come from domestic political resolutions and they need to come from the international community, pushing this sort of thing through the UN and through the Security Council, but how it works in neo-imperial colonial style through coercion and force, it doesn’t seem to have worked so far very well in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria or other places. I don’t think that tradition is going to change in the very near future. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What impact has the civil war in Syria had on the security situation in Iraq?</em> </p><p> <strong>JD:</strong> Indeed. It’s interesting to see that the sectarian violence in Iraq bled over into Syria after the Bashar Al-Assad regime had its political squabbles. And as a result, Iraq has bled over Syria and rebels have increasingly gained the territory, and there is an increasingly porous border with Turkey that the Syrian civil war has then penetrated back into Iraq. Just to quote Muqtada al-Sadr, very famous Shia militant leader, he has said that Al-Qaeda, Al-Sham, and the Islamic State of the Levant are everywhere, in every corner of the street. Syria has bled over in Iraq, Iraq has bled over in Syria and the problem cannot be seen as an Iraqi problem or a Syrian problem. Now the problem of the Islamic State of the Levant and Islamic State of Al-Sham is a regional problem. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>A general election is coming up, what do you think the outcome will be?</em> </p><p> <strong>JD:</strong> The looming political elections going on in Iraq are going to bring two possible problems and two possible very good events. The first problem, that is the biggest problem, could be the increasingly sectarian tensions that would be further dividing society. The other problem is that Al-Qaeda could demonstrate itself as a power force by bombing election cycles, intimidating communities, and as a result, some groups may want to boycott the elections out of fear. This occurred in 2005 most prominently. The two good things to come, if in fact that it is a fair and relatively diplomatic election, you will see increasing cooperation between Sunni and Shia political leaders. The other positive thing that could occur is greater stability in the country. I definitely think that Al-Qaeda will make a stand, some people will be intimidated. So it’s likely that we are going to have some violence, it is likely there is going to be some corruption, but it is also likely that the political establishment in Iraq is going to try to stand for communities and not to be pressured by extremists. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/155836-mironov-ponomaryov-russia-crimea/</guid><title><![CDATA[Fair Russia leader seeks to oust MP for opposing Crimea accession]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/155836-mironov-ponomaryov-russia-crimea/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0b/c0/00/mironov-ponomaryov-russia-crimea.jpg" title="State Duma deputy Ilya Ponomaryov (Reuters/Maxim Shemetov)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 11:13:32 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0b/c0/00/mironov-ponomaryov-russia-crimea.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Sergey Mironov has demanded that State Duma deputy, Ilya Ponomaryov, quit his post as his behavior damaged the reputation of the Fair Russia party.

Technically, Ponomaryov was still a member of the Fair Russia caucus, despite recently leaving the party and this was causing reputational damage to the party, Mironov claimed. </p><p> “<em>Speaking for the whole party, I do not request, but demand – stop clinging to your seat, give up the mandate</em>!” the letter reads. </p><p> In addition, the Fair Russia leader reminded Ponomaryov of the political legacy of his family and asked him not to tarnish his family’s name. Ponomaryov’s mother, Larisa Ponomaryova, was a long time Upper House member and his great-uncle, Boris Ponomaryov, was a top Communist Party official in the Soviet Union. </p><p> Ilya Ponomaryov was elected to the State Duma in 2007 and in 2011 on Fair Russia’s ticket, but their ways parted after Ponomaryov, along with with <a href="http://rt.com/politics/opposition-party-expels-two-senior-members-for-siding-with-street-protesters-245/" target="_blank">two other MPs</a>, took part in <a href="http://rt.com/news/moscow-adoption-law-protest-908/" target="_blank">mass protests</a> against alleged violations at the 2011 parliamentary polls. Fellow parliamentarians, including Mironov, said that if Ponomaryov considered the elections to be unfair he should not occupy the seat received in the very same elections, but the MP refused to leave. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/politics/vice-president-sacked-graft-932/" target="_blank">Another scandal</a> involving Ponomaryov took place in early 2013 when a team of investigators discovered that a senior vice-president of the Skolkovo innovation hub paid the MP $750,000 to deliver 10 lectures and one research paper. The probe and subsequent court hearings proved these facts to be true. The executive in charge was suspended and the MP was ordered to return the money. Ponomaryov pleaded not guilty, saying that the fees were fair and proportional to the amount of work. </p><p> Following this second scandal, Ponomaryov announced in October 2013 that he was quitting the Fair Russia party, but would remain in the State Duma as Russian law allows this. </p><p> Ponomaryov reiterated this intention in comments to Mironov’s open letter – “<em>This is not going to happen – I received this mandate from the voters of Novosibirsk Region and I will fight to the end for the interests of my region and my country</em>,” the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. </p><p> In early April, several deputies from the nationalist party LDPR drafted a parliamentary statement on depriving four Fair Russia MPs of their places in parliament for not supporting the bills on Crimea’s reunification with Russia (Ponomaryov voted against and the other three abstained from voting). However, the document was rejected as it contradicted the federal law on the status of State Duma deputies that only allows such moves in extraordinary cases like high-profile criminal probes against politicians. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155848-russia-in-recession-imf/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Russia in recession’ – IMF]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155848-russia-in-recession-imf/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0c/80/00/russia-in-recession-imf.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Maxim Marmur"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 10:51:39 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0c/80/00/russia-in-recession-imf.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Russia is experiencing recession, and the 2014 growth forecast has been cut to 0.2 percent from 1.3 percent, the International Monetary Fund mission chief to Moscow said on Wednesday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0c/80/00/russia-in-recession-imf.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Maxim Marmur" /> <p> Ukraine and Western-led sanctions are partly to blame, as political tension has dragged down the economic forecast for Russia, which at the beginning of the year, the IMF estimated could reach 3 percent. </p><p> However, Russia was already experiencing recession, IMF mission chief Antonio Spilimbergo told reporters Wednesday. </p><p> <em>"If you understand by recession two quarters of negative economic growth then Russia is experiencing recession now,"</em> Spilimbergo told reporters Wednesday, citing last year’s weak growth of 2013 as evidence. </p><p> Sanctions are hurting the Russian economy, the IMF said. This week both the <a href="http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/">US</a> and the <a href="http://rt.com/news/155620-eu-japan-sanctions-russia/">EU</a> rolled out new sanctions against Moscow for a perceived ‘failure’ of peacekeeping in eastern Ukraine. Moscow maintains Kiev has done next to <a href="http://rt.com/news/155772-ukraine-geneva-agreements-churkin/">nothing</a> to de-escalate the conflict. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/news/eastern-ukraine-army-operation-680/" target="_blank">Turmoil in Ukraine</a> has caused instability in Russian stock markets, and has made investors uneasy about the region. </p><p> Capital outflows are a major concern, and the IMF estimates that in 2014, more than $100 billion will leave Russia. </p><p> The Russian government has estimated capital outflow in 2014 could reach between $70-80 billion. In the first 3 months of 2014, $50.6 billion trickled out of the Russian economy. </p><p> <em>"The difficult situation and especially the uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical situation and follow up of sanctions and escalation of sanctions are weighing very negatively on the investment climate,"</em> Spilimbergo said. </p><p> However, high oil prices continue to have a stabilizing effect on the domestic economy and state finances. Oil and gas export revenues account for more than half of the Russian budget. </p><p> The Washington-based IMF said that in order for Russia to offset the impact of the geopolitical tension in Ukraine, the country must ensure macroeconomic stability. </p><p> The ruble has lost more than 9 percent against the dollar since the beginning of 2014. Last week Russia’s Central Bank unexpectedly <a href="http://rt.com/business/154840-russia-rates-cbr-ukraine/" target="_blank">raised</a> its key interest rate in order to combat inflation. The IMF chief forecast that consumer prices would rise 6 percent in 2014. </p><p> Part of the reasons the ruble has fallen so ‘dramatically’ is because of the Central Bank’s decision to normalize the overvalued currency, which it wants to be free-floating by 2015, a goal the IMF supports. </p><p> Standard &amp; Poor has <a href="http://rt.com/business/154592-standard-poor-russia-rating/" target="_blank">cut</a> Russia's rating to the lowest investment grade, which Moscow says is ‘politically motivated’ and a reason for the country to establish its <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-rating-agency-own-384/" target="_blank">own ratings system</a>. </p><p> Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia faces ‘<a href="http://rt.com/business/154012-sanctions-russia-stronger-medvedev/" target="_blank">unprecedented</a>’ economic challenges, but that sanctions will make Russia stronger. </p><p> Russian government officials believe the best case scenario for 2014 is <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-0-gdp-ukraine-836/" target="_blank">zero growth</a>. </p><p> The Ukraine crisis has pushed Russia to seek more cooperation with China and Asian neighbors, as well as to boost demand for domestic products. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155824-iraq-election-violence-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[Iraq’s first election since US pullout marked by death over political optimism]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155824-iraq-election-violence-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0b/00/00/2iraq-election-violence-us.jpg" title="Members of Iraq's anti-terrorism force are deployed outside polling stations in central Baghdad on April 29, 2014, one day ahead of Iraq's first general election since US troops withdrew.

Addressing his nation, he was quoted by reporters as saying, <em>“I call upon the Iraqi people to head in large numbers to the ballot boxes to send a message of deterrence and a slap to the face of terrorism.”</em> </p><p> Today, in central Baghdad, security was ramped up, with voter searches performed before anyone was allowed inside polling stations. Police blocks and barbed wire line the capital’s streets. However, the day did not pass without violent incident and explosions scattered the country. </p><p> While the seemingly futile attempts at political order are made, chaos and disorder reign across the country. Voting in parts of the west has been canceled due to increased violence. In Fallujah, Sunni anti-government sentiment is marked by popular calls to rise up, showing just how difficult an inclusive political process is at this time. </p><p> </p><p> Iraq’s security forces have not been successful after months of trying to take areas like the province of Anbar from the clutches of armed extremists. It has become a focal point of Sunni discontent. </p><p> Attacks have been taking place with a steady regularity - especially on electoral officials. Wednesday afternoon saw two roadside bombs go off in the north of the country, killing two staff from the electoral commission, further wounding two security officers, according to an army general. The attack took place to the north-west of the ethnically-mixed city of Kirkuk. Another two electoral stations were attacked with RPGs on the outskirts of Baghdad, as well as one in Mosul, 400km north of the capital - killing one. The total death toll from the Wednesday attacks stands at 11 at the time of publication. </p><p> A string of attacks took 24 lives across the country on Tuesday as well – the worst was a double bombing that killed 17 people in an outdoor market just outside Baghdad, in which most of the victims belonged to the Kurdish minority. </p><p> This follows Monday’s carnage, which claimed a further 50 in a wave of suicide attacks by militants disguised as security force members. Most of these targeted election campaigns. </p><p> 2014 saw the deadliest April since 2008, and 4,000 lives have been lost since the start of this year alone, as the Shia government forces of al-Maliki engage a Sunni opposition. More than 400,000 have been displaced. </p><p> Al-Maliki’s party rose to prominence in 2006, just as violence started to really spiral out of control, with Sunni and Shia militants constantly striking each other’s populations. His party is expected to win the most seats on Wednesday, but is still unlikely to take a majority. </p><p> <em>“Our victory is confirmed,”</em> Reuters quoted him as saying, <em>“but we are still talking about how big this victory will be.”</em> This victory will depend on the PM’s ability to get a coalition together, and given the criticism he has received from nearly all ethnic and political denominations in the country, that is unlikely to happen, even amid an atmosphere of Al-Qaeda-inspired violence by groups like The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which puts him in a unique position to be cast in the role of the defender of Shiites against extremist Sunni elements. </p><p> Despite the elections offering hope of a way forward, <em>“the fear is that it’ll only fan the flames of discontent. The prime minster has been accused of being too authoritarian… of making sectarian divisions worse, instead of better,”</em> RT’s Lucy Kafanov reports. <em>“But the opposition is too fractured to mount a serious challenge.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Since the violence of 2006, and up until 2008, the situation had somewhat calmed down, as the Americans reigned in the Sunni opposition, using their help to fight the more extreme, terrorist elements. But the Sunni-Shia animosity has since come back worse than ever, as Sunni Iraqis are complaining against discrimination by the government. That is aside from the already existing criticism of corruption and failures on all fronts, from infrastructure to health to education and the economy. </p><p> These are not only the first democratic elections since the US military pullout – they’re also the fourth since former leader Saddam Hussein’s ouster in 2003. It is becoming clear to some that any chances of stability, political or otherwise, have actually decreased since the time the start of the American occupation. </p><p> <em>“If Iraq had gone through this transition to a perfect peaceful united government, they would still be faced with a very, very difficult legacy of complete destruction of the country’s infrastructure, the toxic legacy of depleted uranium and things like that. And there’s the psychological trauma of the whole population that was bombarded by the US military,”</em> Iraq war veteran Mike Prysner told RT. </p><p> <em>“Their lives are still dominated by the violence of war,”</em> Prysner said. </p><p> Political scientist, Iraq War veteran and former US Marine Jake Diliberto believes this vote is not an indication of change, but a barely useful attempt to path up a sectarian hole that’s been left by the American occupation. </p><p> <em>“Political elections going on in Iraq is going to bring two possible problems and two possible very good events: the first and biggest problem is sectarian tensions; the other problem is that Al-Qaeda could demonstrate itself as a powerful force by bombing election cycles, putting fear and intimidation into communities,”</em> which could lead many to boycott the elections out of fear, Diliberto believes. </p><p> He sees the continuing spiral of brutality and government powerlessness as arising out of a combination of two things: <em>“because of long-term traditional problems within the sectarian communities and because of the US inability to bring political results post-2003 invasion.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155860-brics-imf-fiscal-rescue/</guid><title><![CDATA[BRICS building parallel IMF]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155860-brics-imf-fiscal-rescue/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0d/40/00/brics-imf-fiscal-rescue.jpg" title="he logo of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the organization's headquarters in Washington, DC (AFP Photo/Saul Loeb)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 10:46:08 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0d/40/00/brics-imf-fiscal-rescue.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The post war consensus on financing bodies appears to be breaking down as the West clings desperately to the reins of the IMF and World Bank. In exasperation, the BRICS nations are pushing forward with alternative institutions.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0d/40/00/brics-imf-fiscal-rescue.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="he logo of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the organization's headquarters in Washington, DC (AFP Photo/Saul Loeb)" /> <p> As arbiter of sound government finance, the IMF was once much feared by profligate politicians. When IMF experts were parachuted in as frontline fiscal rescue, the world clearly recognized a major government economic policy failure. Britain famously reached this nadir in the 1970s, when state spending expansion reached a finite limit and Chancellor Healey was forced into a massive policy U-turn endorsing monetarism and fiscal discipline. </p><p> However, in recent years the IMF has become somewhat politicized, losing track of its original goals. Having been a hugely useful player alongside the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in helping rebuild the New Europe post-Soviet collapse, the IMF of recent years has become a rather odd place: headed by a succession of politicians who seem to regard their role as being a prominent office to canvas for the French Presidency while administering economics-lite. </p><p> Nowadays, the IMF has become rather a haven of discredited Keynesian thinking, aka the endlessly meddling interventionist superstate policies beloved of declining Europe, and indeed Obama's America. Typical of the leaderless zeitgeist overseeing relative economic decline, the political classes have become used to foisting a compromised European political figure into the top job at the IMF. What the IMF really needs are strong technocrats as opposed to the spineless politicians who generally operate with (at the very least!) one eye on their next political position. </p><p> Thus the IMF has gradually become less significant as it has manifestly failed to take the fiscal initiative in recent years. First the world's leading champagne socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn and latterly Christine Lagarde have remained beholden to the flawed policies of big debt and big government which suits the cowardly political mood for kicking economic realpolitik down the road. </p><p> What the IMF ought to be doing is behaving like a good doctor, ensuring the patient takes their medicine and reforms in a fashion which will ensure better health, not simply offering an alcoholic a lower proof of vodka and telling them to keep drinking! During recent European bailout negotiations, IMF minutes suggest the political classes managed to ride roughshod over the IMF in order to maintain the flawed (and still crumbling) euro currency at all costs. In that sense, having a weak European with ambitions for higher political office makes a mockery of the idea that the International Monetary Fund is anything more than an overdraft facility to be rigged in favor of perceived western political interests. No wonder the rising East is disillusioned. </p><p> </p><p> The US and Europe have maintained a stranglehold on the IMF/World Bank C-suite not only in the face of a massive eastern renaissance but also with a certain degree of abject hypocrisy given the abysmal financial management of spendthrift US governments for decades let alone the travesty of recent European economic governance. </p><p> Thus the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), fed up with ongoing American stalling at reforming the voting system in the IMF, have been working their way towards a genuine new world order. Pivoting away from the influence of the US-centric Western financial system, it makes sense to create a counterweight to the IMF; a supranational bank for the emerging east. Naturally, the proof of the venture will be in how it operates. It must maintain sound doctrine that keeps government spending under control and is able to mete out the required ‘tough love’ - the classic toolkit involved debt default and currency devaluation to rebalance economies which have failed - in other words precisely the policies required in an economic failed state like Ukraine. Above all else the BRICS-Monetary Fund needs to mix politically neutral with sufficient government support that it can operate without fear or favor. </p><p> Naturally this is likely to cause it to run up against the IMF for as long as the US and EU insist on making the established supranational financial institutions vehicles for managing decline in the eurozone and elsewhere as opposed to actually imposing policies to repair failure governments and re-establish growth. That will mean strict budgets and creditors taking losses - as opposed to the ludicrous move to corporate socialism in Europe/US post 2008 where bankers speculate with impunity in the expectation of taxpayer redemption if things go sour. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155852-india-election-debate-immolation/</guid><title><![CDATA[Horror show in India as debate spectator self-immolates, grabs politician]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155852-india-election-debate-immolation/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0c/c0/00/india-election-debate-immolation.jpg" title="Indian bystanders attempt to douse the blaze during an election television debate in in Sultanpur, a town about 160 kilometres from the city of Lucknow.

The debate show was being recorded for Doordarshan TV in a park and was attended by some 150 spectators. </p><p> <em>"This man suddenly came on the stage, poured petrol on himself and set himself on fire before tightly hugging one of the political guests,"</em> local photographer Pankaj Kumar Gupta said. </p><p> The politician victim of the bizarre attack, Kamruzzama Fauji of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), suffered 75 percent burns, Indian media reported.

The election, which runs until May 12, is expected to bring BJP back to power after 10 years in opposition. </p><p> The debate show on Monday was called Janmanch 2014 (People's Forum 2014) and featured five local politicians. The fire attack happened as it was drawing to an end. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155856-ukraine-alert-president-army/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukrainian army ‘on full alert’, president admits east is beyond control]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155856-ukraine-alert-president-army/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0d/00/00/ukraine-alert-president-army.jpg" title="A Ukrainian soldier stands guard in front of an armoured personnel carrier on a road at a check point near the village of Malinivka, southeast of Slaviansk, in eastern Ukraine April 29, 2014.

Our armed forces have been put on full alert,”</em> Turchinov told Wednesday a council of heads of Ukrainian regions in Kiev, as news agencies report. </p><p> He called on the audience to speed up the creation of regional militias loyal to Kiev. <br><br><em>“We must have the capability to move those units fast to support other regions against such a threat,”</em> he stressed. </p><p> Turchinov admitted that Kiev simply cannot get the situation in the rebellious eastern regions under control and reiterated earlier accusations, saying some people in law enforcement <em>“are cooperating with terrorist organizations,”</em> the name Kiev authorities use to refer to anti-government protesters who are seizing government buildings in eastern Ukraine. </p><p> <em>“Our primary task is to prevent the spread of the terrorist threat to other regions of Ukraine,”</em> he said. </p><p> In contradiction to the previous moves of the government, which included raids on protester checkpoints and other demonstrations of force, Turchinov said <em>“as we know from the experience of Maidan, the use of force is inefficient.

More objective observers see a bureaucratic, inefficient, and hopelessly out of touch ivory tower that is bleeding the country of its savings, and more tragically, its intellectual acuity. </p><p> Nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in the demise of collegiate debate. This once courtly rhetorical sparring ground for class presidents and lawyers-in-training is supposed to be forum for ideas, proofs, and conclusions. And while traditional debates did not typically offer high drama, they did teach students how to produce objectively superior arguments, a skill that many types of potential employers would value. But more recently, debate has succumbed to the worst aspects of moral relativism, academic sloth and politically correct dogma that have transformed it into an unintelligible mix of performance art and petty politics. It's not a debate, but we pretend it is. </p><p> The 2014 National Championship of the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA), one of collegiate debate's governing bodies, made headlines as the first to include two all-African-American finalist teams. The winning team, from Towson University in Maryland, was the first ever comprised solely of African-American women. The results were heralded as a triumph for minority achievement in a field traditionally dominated by white <em>"elites."</em> But this success has come at a great cost: A dramatic change in the rules of the game. The championships, as well as dozens of the CEDA sanctioned debates and championships, are easily found on YouTube. I challenge anyone to watch any of those <em>"debates"</em> and describe the ideas and arguments that participants are supposedly addressing. </p><p> At this year's championship, the actual debate question concerned the wisdom of restricting the war powers of the U.S. president. But instead of addressing one of the most important U.S. foreign policy questions of the past half century, the two teams focused exclusively on how the U.S. was supposedly <em>"at war"</em> with poor black people. Although these arguments were clearly off-subject, it seems that the topic did not matter. The <em>"debate"</em> came off as a mix of rap, personal invective, speed talking, soapbox harangue, and explicative filled rants. When one contestant's time expired, he <em>"brilliantly"</em> yelled <em>"F-ck the time!"</em> As was the case in 2013, when another African American team took the championship, the arguments of the winners completely ignored the stated resolution, and instead used personal experience to challenge the "injustice" of the very notion of debate itself. But subjective arguments have been traditionally dismissed as poor rhetoric. "I won the lottery" is not a good argument in favor of the lottery system. </p><p> But in recent years, logic and objective analysis have come to be considered <em>"white"</em> concepts. In an Atlantic Monthly article (Apr. 16), Osagie Obasogie, a liberal law professor from University of California, is quoted as saying <em>"Various procedures - regardless of whether we're talking about debate formats or law- have the ability to hide the subjective experiences that shape these seemingly 'objective' and 'rational' rules. ...This is the power of racial subordination: making the viewpoint of the dominant group seem like the only true reality."</em> In other words debates, like much in society, was devised by white people to favor white people. This idea, which is the essence of affirmative action, may make professors and students feel good about themselves, but it simply means that minorities have license to underachieve. </p><p> </p><p> Creating an alternate set of rules for people of different backgrounds creates huge problems. What would have happened to Venus and Serena Williams had tennis officials drew up a special set of rules for them to compensate for their background? While they may have won more tournaments, they would not have been pushed to achieve their true potential and their victories would have been empty achievements. While it's true that they faced more obstacles than privileged players from the suburbs, changing the rules to allow for their subjective experiences would have prevented their ultimate success. </p><p> That is exactly what is happening today, not just in debate tournaments, but across universities in general. Excuses are being made and rules are being bent in order to account for our personal differences, race, gender and sexual orientation in particular. This trend is producing a generation of marginally skilled, professionally unprepared graduates. The poor quality of our higher education means that we can't compete with other nations who insist on educating their young people through <em>"objective"</em> and <em>"oppressive"</em> systems. This can also be said of our economy. Dumbed down and subjective criteria allow us to pretend that our economy is growing even as living standards are falling, the labor force is shrinking, savings are evaporating, and opportunity is more and more elusive. Rather than admit the obvious, that we have a remedial economy, we have consistently redefined success downward with revisions to tools we use to measure our economy like GDP, inflation and unemployment. See a deeper analysis of this trend in may latest special report, Taxed By Debt. </p><p> Like with our deteriorating educational system, our economy no longer measures up to previous standards of performance. In education, you can see the difference through comparison to a century old Jr. High School test that I believe would stymie most of today's college graduates. Our economic deterioration can be seen in our high trade deficits, big budget deficits, high public and private debt levels and the explosion in the number of people who rely on government assistance be it in the form of welfare, food stamps, or disability. </p><p> However, according to many economists, none of this is cause for concern as it is simply the way things work in our new <em>"consumer-based," "service-sector,"</em> economy. Instead of growth through savings, capital investment, and production, we now rely on money printing, asset bubbles, leverage, and consumer credit. Inflation, which was once acknowledged as being bad, is now considered good. Persistent trade deficits, once a sign of economic distress, are now considered signs of strong domestic demand. Instead of dealing painfully with intractable problems, we have redefined our liabilities as assets and declared victory. </p><p> In the end, will awarding debate championships to undisciplined, barely comprehensible minority students really help these individuals succeed in life? No law firm or corporation will look to hire debate winners as the competitions have now lost all relevance. Similarly, dumbing down standards to whitewash our poor economy performance will only worsen our problems. Fortunately the Supreme Court last week, with its decision to support Michigan's campaign to end race-based selection practices at state universities, took a tiny step in dismantling this lunacy. But we must be on the lookout for much lower profile aspects of the same confrontation. The front lines are everywhere. </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Peter Schiff <br></span></em> </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Peter Schiff is the CEO and Chief Global Strategist of Euro Pacific Capital, best-selling author and host of syndicated Peter Schiff Show.</span></em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155776-congo-investment-russia-economy/</guid><title><![CDATA[Congo president: Africa needs Russia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155776-congo-investment-russia-economy/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/08/00/00/rtr2ef2y.jpg" title="Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso (Reuters / Hakon Mosvold Larsen / Scanpix)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 07:16:34 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/08/00/00/rtr2ef2y.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The resource-rich West African state of Congo plans to attract infrastructure investment from Russia, President Denis Sassou Nguesso told Russian media.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/08/00/00/rtr2ef2y.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso (Reuters / Hakon Mosvold Larsen / Scanpix)" /> <p> <em>“We plan to develop co-operation in all areas: hydrocarbons, agriculture, minerals, logging and education and training,”</em> he said to RIA Novosti. </p><p> Sassou Nguesso, who first became the leader of his country in 1979, was originally a committed Marxist, and relied on the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. </p><p> He still thanks the USSR <em>“for fighting for the freedom of the people of Africa,”</em> and speaks warmly of the thousands of Congolese who studied and married in the Soviet Union. However, he realizes that the relationship had to be rebuilt anew, following wide-scale political and economic transformations in both countries. </p><p> Sassou Nguesso believes the foundation was laid during an official meeting with Vladimir Putin in November 2012. </p><p> <em>“These extraordinarily important talks allowed us to re-launch our partnership,”</em> he said. <em>“A new stage has started and in the coming month an inter-governmental Russia-Congo commission will meet.

He said the stand-off in Ukraine had resulted from a <em>“uniquely personally-driven set of choices”</em> and is <em>“a wake-up call”</em> for NATO. He added that now the military bloc must turn the page on two decades of focusing on expeditionary operations and take a stand against <em>“Putin’s Russia.”</em> </p><p> <em>“After two decades of focusing primarily on our expeditionary missions, the crisis in Ukraine now call us back to the work that this alliance was originally created to perform,”</em> Kerry told the audience. </p><p> NATO’s original purpose was to oppose the Communist Soviet Union, giving the West the military backbone to the ideologically-driven stand-off with the East. Kerry described it as <em>“to defend alliance territory and advance trans-Atlantic security.”</em> </p><p> <em>“Today, Putin’s Russia is playing by a different set of rules,”</em> the secretary stated. <em>“Through its occupation of Crimea and its subsequent destabilization of eastern Ukraine, Russia seeks to change the security landscape of Eastern and Central Europe.”</em> </p><p> <em>“Together we have to push back against those who try to change sovereign border by force. Together we have to support those who simply want to live as we do,”</em> he added. </p><p> </p><p> Kerry didn’t mention NATO’s own operations against Yugoslavia, which helped change sovereign borders in Europe. But he said NATO must not allow the situation continue to develop as it is, because Russia is challenging the position NATO members held since the end of the Cold War. </p><p> <em>“Our entire model of global leadership is at stake. If we stand together, if we draw strength from the example of the past and refuse to be complacent in the present, then I am confident that NATO, the planet’s strongest alliance, can meet the challenges, can absolutely take advantage of the opportunities that are presented by crisis,”</em> he stressed. </p><p> Kerry suggested three points on how trans-Atlantic partners can preserve their leadership and contain Russia. He said all NATO members must comply with alliance’s benchmark of 2 percent GDP defense spending, which is not observed by many European members of the alliance, including European economic powerhouse Germany. </p><p> <em>“Clearly, not all allies are going to meet the NATO benchmark of 2 percent of GDP overnight or even next year,”</em> Kerry said. <em>“But it’s time for allies, who are below that level to make credible commitments to increase their spending on defense over the next five years.”</em> </p><p> NATO members must also help Europe reduce its dependence on Russian energy and develop economic ties with America by speeding down the pipeline the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement, Kerry said. </p><p> The agreement would certainly give more access to European markets to some US corporations, as it would require freeing up European regulations on things like fracking, GMOs, copyright and finance. </p><p> </p><p> Kerry’s policy remarks are in line with those made recently by some other members of the US political establishment. For example Senator John McCain, one of the most vocal critics of Russia, went on the same lines of presenting Russia’s stance on Ukraine a personal choice by President Vladimir Putin and calling for more defense spending in Europe in his speech at Vilnius University, Lithuania, on Wednesday last week. </p><p> <em>“Considering what President Putin is doing right now in Ukraine, it is more important than ever for every NATO ally to spend at least 2 percent of its GDP on defense,”</em> McCain said. <em>“I'm pleased that Lithuania has pledged and is planning to do this, and the sooner you follow through on that commitment the better.”</em> </p><p> The US and Russia have been trading accusations of meddling with Ukrainian crisis lately. Washington says Moscow is sowing dissent in eastern Ukraine, fanning up anti-government protests there. Russia says the US sponsored the February coup in Kiev, which brought into power the current Ukrainian central authorities and has been playing a dominant role in defining the policies of the new government. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155772-ukraine-geneva-agreements-churkin/</guid><title><![CDATA[Kiev did nothing to fulfill Geneva agreements – Russia’s UN envoy]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155772-ukraine-geneva-agreements-churkin/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/c0/00/rtr3g01x.jpg" title="Russian Ambassador to the U.N.

Vitaly Churkin (Reuters / Shannon Stapleton)" /> <p> <em>“Nothing has been done on behalf of Kiev’s authorities to implement the Geneva document. Our Western colleagues, primarily the Americans – who now have an unprecedented influence over Kiev – could not or did not want to convince Kiev to fulfill its obligations under the Geneva agreement,”</em> Churkin said during the UN Security Council meeting in New York on Tuesday. </p><p> Addressing the meeting, US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power accused Russia of stirring up trouble in eastern Ukraine and undermining the government in Kiev. </p><p> “<em>Russia continues to fund, to coordinate, and to fuel the heavily-armed separatist movement,"</em> she said. </p><p> Churkin denied the claims and added that if the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, the West should comprehend its level of responsibility in the matter. </p><p> On April 17, Russia, the US, the EU, and Ukraine <a href="http://rt.com/news/geneva-document-ukraine-deescalation-224/" target="_blank">adopted</a> a joint document on the de-escalation of the Ukraine crisis, calling for all illegal armed groups to lay down arms and for a wide amnesty for detained protesters. </p><p> Churkin stated that none of the radical groups are laying down arms, including the far-right group Right Sector, which is <em>“marching under the Nazi flags.”</em> </p><p> <em>“On the contrary, these groups have been granted legal status, and [have been] used to form the paramilitary battalions 'Dnepr,' 'Slobozhanschina,' and ‘Donbass,'”</em> he said. </p><p> According to Churkin, Kiev’s Independence Square is still being occupied, even though that is in violation of one of the items in the Geneva agreements. <em>“Nobody is vacating anything in Kiev, while Washington is complacently claiming that the buildings are being ‘legally rented out,’”</em> he stated. </p><p> The Russian envoy to the UN also highlighted that repressions against those disagreeing with Kiev’s coup-imposed authorities are continuing, adding that there has been no amnesty for arrested protesters. </p><p> Churkin stated that the current Ukrainian regime, supported by the West, is pushing the country towards a catastrophe. </p><p> He also criticized other states which have claimed that Russia is not doing its part to influence protesters in southeastern Ukraine. <em>“How can you convince the militias in the east of the country to disarm or leave the buildings if they are surrounded, like in Slavyansk, by Ukrainian armed forces and the so-called ‘National Guard’ units, entirely consisting of Right Sector militias?”</em> he said. </p><p> In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday claimed the US has been <a href="http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/" target="_blank">behind</a> the Ukrainian crisis from the beginning, but was initially flying low. He added that if sanctions continue, Russia will have to reconsider who has access to key sectors of its economy. </p><p> <em>“I think what is happening now shows us who really was mastering the process from the beginning. But in the beginning, the United States preferred to remain in the shadow,”</em> Putin said, as quoted by RIA Novosti. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155768-brunei-implements-sharia-law/</guid><title><![CDATA[Brunei adopts Sharia law despite international criticism]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155768-brunei-implements-sharia-law/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/80/00/000_hkg8510073.jpg" title="The Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque in Bandar Seri Begawan (AFP Photo / Roslan Rahman)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 04:13:16 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/07/80/00/000_hkg8510073.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Brunei is to become the first East Asian country to adopt Sharia law as the sultan confirmed the Islamic penal code on Wednesday. The move sparks broad concern over the rights of women and minorities.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/80/00/000_hkg8510073.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="The Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque in Bandar Seri Begawan (AFP Photo / Roslan Rahman)" /> <p> Sharia law will be implemented nationwide starting Thursday. </p><p> "<em>Today... I place my faith in and am grateful to Allah the almighty to announce that tomorrow, Thursday May 1, 2014, will see the enforcement of Sharia law phase one, to be followed by the other phases</em>," Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said in a speech, AFP reports. </p><p> The implementation of Sharia law would mean that residents will face conviction by Islamic courts for their crimes. Most of the laws will apply to non-Muslims, as well. The first phase, which goes into effect on Thursday, will give offenders fines or jail time for acts ranging from pregnancy outside marriage, propagating other religions, or failure to perform Friday prayers. A second phase will go into effect after a year, punishing those who steal or consume alcohol with whipping and amputations. The final stage will take effect in two years, and will use the death penalty - possibly by stoning - for crimes like adultery, sodomy, or insulting the Koran or the Prophet Mohammed. </p><p> The implementation of the Sharia law sparks concerns over the rights of minorities as about 20 percent of Brunei residents are non-Muslim, most of whom follow Buddhist, Christian, and indigenous belief systems. Chinese make up the largest ethnic minority at 10 percent of the population, while the majority ethnic Malays make up 65 percent. Brunei is also home to 30,000 mostly Roman Catholic Filipino migrant workers and many Western oil workers, according to Reuters. </p><p> </p><p> The United Nations spoke out against the revised penal code. <em>"We are deeply concerned about the revised penal code in Brunei Darussalam, due to come into force later this month, which stipulates the death penalty for numerous offenses,"</em> Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN high commissioner for human rights, <a href="http://rt.com/news/brunei-gay-death-stoning-104/">told reporters</a>. <em>“The application of the death penalty for such a broad range of offenses contravenes international law.”</em> </p><p> Emerlynne Gil, Southeast Asia legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists, told Reuters: <em>"A lot of these provisions and penalties discriminate against women. Stoning to death normally has a huge impact on women because more often than not they are found guilty of these crimes."</em> </p><p> Gay rights organizations in the Asia Pacific have condemned the move to Sharia law. <em>“It may open the floodgates for further human rights violations against women, children, and other people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,”</em> <a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/sideviews/article/bruneis-revised-penal-code-a-cause-of-concern-for-sexual-minorities-isean"> two such groups wrote</a> in a Malaysian Insider op-ed. <em>“Penalty by death sentence contravenes several international human rights laws. Further, death by stoning constitutes torture or other cruel, degrading and inhumane acts of punishment, thus a clear infringement of international humanitarian principles and universal human rights.”</em> </p><p> Indigenous peoples who are not part of the Malay Muslim majority are encouraged to move away from their native languages and cultures, the World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples reported. The government also organizes proselytizing activities and provides financial incentives for converting to Islam. </p><p> But Brunei’s top Islamic scholar denied that Sharia law would lead to extremes in the country. <em>"It is not indiscriminate cutting or stoning or caning,"</em> state media quoted Awang Abdul Aziz as saying after the law was announced. <em>"There are conditions and there are methods that are just and fair."</em> </p><p> Diplomats are taking a wait-and-see approach to the law, saying it remains unclear how the system will work once implemented, as well as how it will coexist with the existing British-based legal system, Reuters reported. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155760-voice-america-reform-support/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Reform bill would require Voice of America to trumpet US policy objectives – report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155760-voice-america-reform-support/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/00/00/rtr1vft.jpg" title="Reuters / Mike Theiler&#10;"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 03:27:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/07/00/00/rtr1vft.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Members of the US House and Senate are working together to craft legislation that would reform US-government-funded broadcasting outlets like Voice of America. The bill would require the channels to “support” US “public diplomacy” and “policy objectives.”]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/00/00/rtr1vft.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Mike Theiler
" /> <p> Reform <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/220963843/Bbg-Reform-Text-Final" target="_blank">legislation</a> in the House would change the language of Voice of America’s mission to demand adherence to US foreign policy directives, according to a report by Foreign Policy magazine, calling into question how much editorial independence Voice of America (VOA) will have left. </p><p> <em>"It is time for broad reforms; now more than ever, U.S. international broadcasts must be effective,"</em> Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. </p><p> The bill has been in the works among top Republicans and Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs and the Senate Foreign Relations Committees for a year, Foreign Policy <a href="http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/04/29/exclusive_new_bill_requires_voice_of_america_to_toe_us_line" target="_blank">wrote</a>. The House bill, supported by Foreign Affairs Committee head Eliot Engel, will get a panel vote on Wednesday. </p><p> Not only does the bill aim to clarify VOA’s mission – which has arguably leaned away from consistently backing the official line in Washington in recent years – but it also reorganizes the federal agency that oversees US-funded media outlets, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). </p><p> BBG will go from having part-time board members leading the organization – US Secretary of State John Kerry is one current <a href="http://www.bbg.gov/about-the-agency/" target="_blank">board</a> member – to a full-time agency official directing daily operations. The bill would also consolidate Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network into one <em>“non-federal organization,”</em> Foreign Policy reported. The legislation will also attempt to cut the number of federal contractors that work at the outlets. </p><p> <em>"This legislation makes clear that the Voice of America mission is to support U.S. public diplomacy efforts,"</em> a summary of the new bill outlines. <em>"The VOA charter states that VOA will provide a ‘clear and effective presentation of the policies of the United States...Over time, VOA has abandoned this mission."</em> </p><p> A spokesperson for BBG would not speak on the proposal. <em>"The agency does not comment on pending legislation,"</em> Lynne Weil told Foreign Policy. </p><p> VOA, by far the most widespread of BBG’s networks, produces news and cultural programming in 45 languages and reaches more than 164 million people around the world through television, radio, internet, and mobile platforms. </p><p> It <a href="http://www.insidevoa.com/section/voa_history/2330.html" target="_blank">began</a> as an arm of the Office of War Information in 1942 as a way to match Nazi and Japanese propaganda. The State Department and the US Information Agency took it over in the 1950s, when it turned to counter Communist countries during the Cold War. VOA’s global broadcasts of American jazz music were popular at this time. Major live VOA broadcasts include Martin Luther King Jr.’s <em>“I Have a Dream”</em> address in 1963 and the 1969 moon landing, which 450 million people heard on hundreds of stations worldwide. </p><p> In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed into law VOA’s mission as an <em>"accurate, objective, and comprehensive"</em> news outlet as opposed to an explicit propagandistic venture. </p><p> Since then, <em>“employees at the TV and radio broadcaster have insisted on viewing themselves as objective journalists as opposed to instruments”</em> of the US government’s policies abroad, wrote Foreign Policy. And since, on occasion, VOA has highlighted stories that did not reflect well on the United States, US officials have wondered why hundreds of millions of dollars is spent on a project that does not have a more pro-American outlook. </p><p> News of the reform bill comes days after the Sec. of State Kerry <a href="http://rt.com/news/154760-kerry-attacks-rt-propaganda/" target="_blank">accused</a> RT of being a state-sponsored <em>“propaganda bullhorn”</em> that is <em>“deployed to promote President Putin’s fantasy about what is playing out on the ground”</em> amid unrest in Ukraine. Furthermore, he said RT spends almost all its time <em>“propagandizing and distorting what is happening, or not happening, in Ukraine.”</em> </p><p> Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov <a href="http://rt.com/news/154800-lavrov-kerry-rt-comment/" target="_blank">denounced</a> Kerry’s latest comments about RT as <em>“uncivilized”</em> and <em>“prosecutorial.”</em> </p><p> <em>“[The West] was convinced for some time that it had a full monopoly on mass media,”</em> said Lavrov in a statement. <em>“Russia Today has won a large audience in the US and Western Europe, not to mention in Latin America and the Arab world."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155756-faa-journalist-drone-tornado-investigation/</guid><title><![CDATA[FAA ‘looking into’ $10K fine for drone recording of tornado disaster area]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155756-faa-journalist-drone-tornado-investigation/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/c0/00/screen_shot_2014-04-30_at_04.52.22.jpg" title="A screenshot from a video uploaded on YouTube by Brian Emfinger"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 01:32:47 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://img.rt.com/files/news/26/06/c0/00/screen_shot_2014-04-30_at_04.52.22.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Federal Aviation Administration, already facing criticism from private drone operators, has launched an investigation into drone use in the aftermath of the devastating tornadoes that swept across the southeastern United States.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/c0/00/screen_shot_2014-04-30_at_04.52.22.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A screenshot from a video uploaded on YouTube by Brian Emfinger" /> <p> The <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2014/apr/29/rules-hazy-drone-coverage-tornado-20140429/" target="_blank">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</a> reported Tuesday that the FAA has initiated a probe into the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather aerial footage of the terrible scene in Arkansas, where at least 14 people died over the past few days due to the tornados. One of the worst hit areas was Mayflower, Arkansas, located just 40 minutes away from the state capital of Little Rock, where over a dozen people died. </p><p> Storm chaser and videographer Brian Eminger sought to help the public understand just how bad the disaster was by sending a drone equipped with a video camera over Mayflower just moments after the storms had passed. </p><p> A short video he posted on YouTube, which attracted nearly two million views within just 48 hours, showed emergency crews sifting through rubble where homes and buildings once stood. The images proved that the small Arkansas town was unrecognizable compared to just hours before, with vehicles and large piles of lumber strewn across the highway and elsewhere. </p><p> Eminger’s drone measures approximately 18 inches wide with small propellers that are about eight inches long, he told the Gazette. He used it in the past to help a local TV station obtain footage of a hotel fire in Hot Springs, Arkansas, but could now face a $10,000 fine because of strict FAA guidelines. </p><p> </p><p> The agency’s regulations prohibit UAVs from being used for commercial purposes, including reporting, although photographers and press watchdogs alike have complained that the rule (designed to keep drones out of the flight path of major aircraft) are a violation of the freedom of press guaranteed by the First Amendment. </p><p> Proponents have also complained that frivolous restrictions on drone activity are a needless limit that eliminates a potentially helpful tool for first responders. </p><p> Matt Waite, director of the Drone Journalism Lab for the College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, previously made headlines when his class, which was learning how to use drones for journalistic purposes, received a cease-and-desist letter from the FAA forcing them to continue their instruction inside. The problem, Waite told <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/04/29/faa-looking-into-arkansas-tornado-drone-journalism-raising-first-amendment-questions/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, affects a variety of areas where UAVs could be incredibly useful. </p><p> “<em>We don’t have really clear rules of the road right now for the use of drones for journalists or anyone, really</em>,” he said on Tuesday. “<em>There are a tremendous amount of questions that are floating around out there that have significant ramifications of how journalists will use there, that we do not have solid answers for</em>.” </p><p> When questioned Monday on whether the FAA had seen Eminger’s video, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford told the Gazette that “<em>We are looking into it</em>.” </p><p> If Eminger is nervous about being on the hook for $10,000, though, a March court ruling could provide some relief. The agency previously tried to levy a fine against Raphael Pirker, a videographer whose company 'Team Black Sheep' uses drones to capture unique footage. Pirker convinced Judge Patrick G. Geraghty that “<em>there was no enforceable FAA rule or FAR Regulation, applicable to model aircraft or for classifying model aircraft as an UAS [Unmanned Aircraft System]</em>.” </p><p> The FAA appealed the decision, citing air safety and security. The spokeswoman did not provide any details on when the agency could seek legal action against Eminger. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/c7s2lzDtjew" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155764-controversial-oklahoma-execution-wrong/</guid><title><![CDATA[Oklahoma inmate dies after botched lethal injection, 2nd prisoner granted stay of execution]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155764-controversial-oklahoma-execution-wrong/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/40/00/rtr3mijl.jpg" title="Clayton D.

Lockett, 38, was scheduled to be executed at 6pm local time Tuesday with a combination of lethal drugs, details of which were kept secret despite a flurry of court challenges and commentary from Oklahoma lawmakers in the weeks leading up to Lockett’s death. </p><p> Bailey Elise McBride, an Associated Press reporter, was on hand to cover the execution but quickly reported that, while the average execution takes just minutes to complete, media was kept waiting for word for nearly an hour on what happened. </p><p> Prison officials eventually admitted that they had to cancel the execution, which officially began at 6:23pm, because Lockett was still moving at 6:37 and looked up to say, <em>“Something’s wrong.”</em> </p><p> McBride reported that the inmate was <em>“conscious and blinking, licking his lips even after the process began. He then began to seize.”</em> </p><p> Department of Corrections officials said at a press conference immediately following the would-be execution that Lockett had blown a vein and that they are not sure where the drugs went in his body, or how much of the injection his body absorbed. Locket died of a heart attack moments after his convulsion began. </p><p> David Autry, Lockett’s attorney, told assembled media the execution was <em>“botched “</em> and that the state was <em>“bound and determined”</em> to put Lockett to death, adding that the entire proceeding was “extremely difficult” to witness. </p><p> Autry later said Lockett was given <em>“an overdose level”</em> of midazolam, a benzodiazepine usually administered in smaller doses to make patients drowsy. </p><p> Lockett was scheduled to be executed just hours before Charles Warner. Following the incident Tuesday night, the prison director granted Warner a fourteen day stay of execution. <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A botched execution in Oklahoma could be a very big deal for various lethal injection cases across the US.</span> </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> — Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/statuses/461299726940241920">April 30, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> The double execution was supposed to be the end of an arduous legal battle that has lasted for weeks. Representation for both Lockett (convicted in the 1999 kidnapping, rape, and murder of a 19-year-old woman) and Warner (convicted for the 1997 rape and murder of an 11-month-old girl) asserted that each inmate had the right to know which drugs would be included in the cocktail that would be used to kill them. </p><p> The state disagreed, with the matter going all the way up to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision, the high court agreed with the prisoners and noted that the decision would be the <em>“final determination of all issues presently pending before the court.”</em> </p><p> The court, which overturned its own ruling two days later, permitting the executions to go on as originally scheduled, was immediately criticized by Oklahoma politicians. Republican Governor Mary Fallin said that, because the neither inmate contested their guilt, the executions should both occur on Tuesday night. </p><p> <em>“Tonight, in a climate of secrecy and political posturing, Oklahoma intends to kill two death row prisoners using an experimental new drug protocol, including a paralytic, making it impossible to know whether the executions will comport with the Eighth amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual suffering,”</em> Madeline Cohen, Warner’s attorney, said in a press statement Tuesday. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155744-johnson-sterling-all-black-league/</guid><title><![CDATA[Former Knicks' great responds to NBA race scandal with call for black-only league]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155744-johnson-sterling-all-black-league/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/00/00/rtr30i03.jpg" title="Former New York Knicks Larry Johnson (Reuters / Adam Hunger)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 00:48:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/06/00/00/rtr30i03.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />New York Knicks executive and former star Larry Johnson reacted on Twitter to racist and misogynistic remarks made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling by calling for an all African-American basketball league.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/00/00/rtr30i03.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Former New York Knicks Larry Johnson (Reuters / Adam Hunger)" /> <p> Sterling landed in hot water over the weekend, when TMZ released an audio recording believed to be of Sterling telling his mistress V.

(AFP Photo / Khaled Desouki)" /> <p> The statement made by the longest-serving US senator is another complication in Washington’s relationship with Cairo. Since the ouster last year of democratically-elected President Mohammed Morsi by the Egyptian military and allies, the Obama administration has walked a fine line between touting the democratic process while still ultimately maintaining strong allegiances with Egypt, a main ally in the region. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/154336-pentagon-apache-aid-egypt/" target="_blank">Last week</a>, the Pentagon said it would send 10 Apache attack helicopters and $650 million to Egypt’s military regime, which has brutally suppressed dissent among Islamist supporters of Morsi and other groups. The Apaches do not need congressional approval, aides on Capitol Hill said, according to Reuters. </p><p> <em>"I'm not prepared to sign off on the delivery of additional aid for the Egyptian military,"</em> Leahy said from the Senate floor on Tuesday. <em>"I'm not prepared to do that until we see convincing evidence the government is committed to the rule of law."</em> </p><p> An Egyptian court <a href="http://rt.com/news/155284-egypt-court-death-penalty/" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to death 683 supporters of Morsi, forced from office last July, including one of his Muslim Brotherhood movement leaders, Mohamed Badie. </p><p> The new sentences passed on Muslim Brotherhood members came over charges relating to an attack on a police station last August. Some believe the mass sentence is an intimidation tactic to further suppress opposition ahead of the May election, and that the courts will eventually downgrade the execution mandates to life in prison. </p><p> <a href="http://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/-statement-of-senator-patrick-leahy-on-recent-developments-in-egypt-senate-floor" target="_blank">Leahy</a>, chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, called the court ruling part of <em>“a sham trial lasting barely an hour.”</em> </p><p> <em>"It's an appalling abuse of the justice system, which is fundamental to any democracy. Nobody, nobody, can justify this. It does not show democracy. It shows a dictatorship run amok. It is a total violation of human rights,"</em> he said. </p><p> </p><p> Washington usually offers $1.5 billion a year in aid to Egypt, most of it going to the military. Though a humanitarian law, written by Leahy, disallows funding governments that seized power through military coups. </p><p> Whether to call Morsi’s overthrow in July a coup or not flustered the Obama administration, though it eventually cut off aid in October. Morsi was elected in a national vote after the 30-year reign of Hosni Mubarak ended in February 2011 amid popular unrest. </p><p> Obama administration officials have not commented on Leahy’s statements, but said they would discuss the matter with members of Congress, according to Reuters. </p><p> US Secretary of State John Kerry met for an hour on Tuesday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy in Washington, where he made clear the US was <em>“deeply disturbed”</em> by the latest developments in Egypt, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. </p><p> <em>"These actions represent a setback and make it more challenging to move forward,"</em> Psaki said at a department press briefing. She added that the State Department will be in touch with Congress to discuss concerns. </p><p> Elsewhere, the European Union’s foreign policy chief denounced the mass death sentence. </p><p> <em>"These mass trials are clearly in breach of international human rights law,"</em> the EU's Catherine Ashton said in a statement. </p><p> <em>"The exact charges against each defendant remain unclear, the proceedings lack the most basic standards of due process and the verdicts appear grossly disproportionate, failing short of complying with the principle of individual sentencing,"</em> she said. </p><p> Ashton also questioned <em>"the seriousness of Egypt's transition towards democracy."</em> </p><p> <em>"The EU calls on the Egyptian authorities to immediately reverse this trend which jeopardizes any prospects for overcoming divisions within society and to ensure progress towards a truly democratic, stable and prosperous Egypt,"</em> she said. </p><p> On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed dismay over the court’s ruling. </p><p> <em>"Verdicts that clearly appear not to meet basic fair trial standards, particularly those which impose the death penalty, are likely to undermine prospects for long-term stability,”</em> read a statement from the Secretary-General’s office. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155736-online-pirate-extortion-copyright-troll/</guid><title><![CDATA[Judge, siding with accused pirate, orders ‘copyright troll’ to pay up]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155736-online-pirate-extortion-copyright-troll/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/05/80/00/rtx14knk.jpg" title="Reuters / Petar Kujundzic"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 23:15:24 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/05/80/00/rtx14knk.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />High-powered law firms have for decades won massive settlements from accused online pirates based on legal claims that are now in doubt. Initiating so many battles has created a lot of enemies, though, as one firm recently found out.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/05/80/00/rtx14knk.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Petar Kujundzic" /> <p> Dunlap, Grubb and Weaver was one of the legal agencies that teamed up with Hollywood film studios and the United States Copyright Group (USCG) to file suit against tens of thousands of suspected BitTorrent users who acquired music, movies, or other media content illegally. </p><p> Since online piracy became common in the early 2000s, lawsuits trying to stop downloaders have traditionally identified the alleged pirate by their IP address, a computer’s individual specification number that could be likened to its fingerprint. Hundreds of suits were successful in reaping millions of dollars for the plaintiffs, until a recent string of rulings in which state and federal judges announced that an IP address alone was insufficient evidence of a defendant’s guilt. </p><p> Defense attorneys representing accused pirates have claimed that, because of the legal grey area, prosecutors sometimes take any measure they can to convince the defendant to settle, rather than leaving the decision up to a judge. </p><p> In early 2010, Dunlap, Grubb and Weaver (DGW) – along with film studio Achte/Neunte and GuardaLey, a German tracking company – began legal proceedings against thousands of internet users suspected of illegally downloading the film “Far Cry,” a little-seen film based on a video game of the same name. </p><p> Just months after the suit was filed, though, one of the alleged pirates named in the suit filed a counter-suit alleging that Dunlap, Grubb and Weaver committed fraud, abuse, extortion, and a number of other offenses because of their role in a “copyright troll” scheme. </p><p> Dmitriy Shirokov first filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of nearly 3,000 people named in the original suit, alleging that DGW was threatening to sue all of those people even though such an effort would be far beyond the relatively small firm’s means. </p><p> “<em>DGW does not genuinely intend to pursue most, if any, of these thousands of claims to trial</em>,” the complaint read, as quoted by <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-lawyers-sued-for-fraud-abuse-and-extortion-101129/" target="_blank">TorrentFreak</a>. “<em>Operating through its alias USCG, DGW advertises its copyright business model to prospective clients in the film industry stating one overriding goal: to ‘obtain settlement’ – not judgments, which would require litigating and proving its allegations</em>.” </p><p> “<em>With only thirteen attorneys on staff, DGW has issued a volume of demand letters that far surpass its ability to litigate this volume of claims case by case</em>,” the filing continued. “<em>USCG tells prospective clients that civil prosecution of copyright claims has not been ‘practical,’ in light of the financial status of individual infringers</em>.” </p><p> The Massachusetts District Court denied the suit’s class-action status last year, severely limiting the financial compensation, although TorrentFreak reported Tuesday that Judge George O’Toole ordered DGW to pay $39,909.95 (including attorney fees). The decision comes after three years of claims that DGW was unable to find the necessary evidence indicating that they were not trying to extort suspected pirates, that the company’s computer system had crashed, and other stall tactics. </p><p> “<em>The case did accomplish what we wanted it to</em>,” Jason Sweet, Shirkov’s attorney, told <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/accused-downloader-wins-case-copyright-trolls-140429/" target="_blank">TorrentFreak</a>. “<em>That is, to deter others from starting similar cases in Massachusetts. It served its purpose</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155748-rally-kiev-massive-fight/</guid><title><![CDATA[Far-right rally turns into massive brawl on Kiev’s Maidan, shots heard (PHOTOS)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155748-rally-kiev-massive-fight/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/40/00/000_par7866565.jpg" title="Pro-Kiev activists clash with ultra-nationalists activists in their attempt to stop them to march through the Independence Square in Kiev on April 29, 2014.

(AFP Photo / Sergey Supinsky)" /> <p> Eye witnesses described over 100 people, reportedly members of the far-right Social-National Assembly, marching with burning torches towards Maidan – the epicenter of the massive uprising that removed former President Yanukovich from power. The marchers came to commemorate those killed during anti-government protests in December-February. </p><p> </p><p> Maidan self-defense units blocked the rally at the barricades across from the main post office, prompting a massive fight. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3-vOWogFXnU" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="420"></iframe> </p><p> The far-right radicals reportedly used firecrackers, traumatic guns, and tear gas.

Witnesses reported ambulances arriving at the scene. </p><p> Eventually, the self-defense units allowed the rally to pass through. The march then began to move towards Ukrainian Parliament, local television channels reported. </p><p> </p><p> Nationalist sentiment has been prevalent in Ukraine throughout the ongoing crisis. On Sunday, hundreds took part in a <a href="http://rt.com/news/155364-ukraine-nazi-division-march/" target="_blank">march</a> in the western city of Lvov to mark the anniversary of the formation of the 'Galician' Ukrainian SS division, which fought for the Nazis against the Soviet Union during World War II. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155740-libya-prime-minister-parliament/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Gunmen raid Libyan parliament, stop crucial vote on next PM]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155740-libya-prime-minister-parliament/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/05/c0/00/rtr2qkjk.jpg" title="Reuters / Louafi Larbi"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 21:56:30 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/05/c0/00/rtr2qkjk.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Gunmen attacked Libya’s parliament on Tuesday just as lawmakers were to hold a vote on the country’s next prime minister. The assailants opened fire, wounding several, according to parliament spokesman Omar Hmeidan.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/05/c0/00/rtr2qkjk.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Louafi Larbi" /> <p> Lawmakers fled the building, according to witnesses. Though the siege ended quickly, the crucial vote to replace Premier Abdullah Al-Thinni was postponed until next week. </p><p> Hmeidan said the gunmen were associated with one of the defeated prime minister candidates, though he did not name which failed candidate it was, Reuters reported. </p><p> Parliament deputies were to hold a final vote to replace Thinni before the interruption. Thinni resigned two weeks ago after he claimed gunmen had targeted his family. </p><p> Thinni was the successor to Ali Zeidan, who was tossed from office by deputies after rebels in the east had <a href="http://rt.com/news/libya-oil-blockade-rebels-697/" target="_blank">maintained</a> a months-long blockade of oil export ports, attempting to sell oil independently. </p><p> The prior vote resulted in a win for businessman Ahmed Maiteeq over six other candidates. Maiteeq was to face runner-up Omar Al-Hasi in the second and final vote before the parliament raid. </p><p> Three years after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi, the weak Libyan government has been unable to control rebel factions, Islamists, and territorial rivals that have refused to disarm or abandon their regional fiefdoms. Militias often attack the interim General National Congress (GNC) to make political or financial demands, according to Reuters. </p><p> The divides in the GNC assembly mirror the diversity of groups on the ground. Deadlock reigns among Islamists, tribal leaders, and nationalists, all as the struggling army attempts to maintain order against fighters, Islamic militants, and tribal groups. </p><p> Libyans, angry at the slow pace of change, pushed parliament in February to agree to early elections. Deputies had agreed to extend their terms past the February 7 mandate to allow a special committee to draft a new constitution. The move provoked protests among the population, as the citizenry largely blames congress for the lack of progress in the post-Gaddafi transition. </p><p> Meanwhile, assembly president Nouri Abu Sahmain is under investigation for a leaked video of him being questioned about a late-night visit in January by two women at his house, according to Benghazi MP Ahmed Langhi. </p><p> Abu Sahmain is a powerful army commander who disappeared from the public eye in March when the attorney general began the probe. Rumors have it that he was briefly detained by a militia to question him about the women, but he denies he was ever kidnapped. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
