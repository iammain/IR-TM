The possibility of Russia exporting 500 megawatts of electricity to Iran is also on the cards, said Mehr. <br><br> The strengthening of economic ties between the two countries is of heightened significance given both economic sanctions on Iran, imposed with the aim of encouraging Iran to cut its uranium stockpiles, and new economic sanctions on Russian officials imposed on Monday. <br><br> On Sunday, Chitchian reportedly stressed <em>“the need for further expansion of economic ties between Tehran and Moscow, particularly in the energy and commerce spheres</em>,” stated Mehr. <br><br> Moscow has additionally been discussing the trade of 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil for Russian goods with Tehran. The protracted deal, first reported at the beginning of April could be worth as much as $20 billion, and has rattled Washington because it could bring Iran's crude exports above one million barrels a day - the threshold agreed upon in the nuclear deal between the P5+1 powers - US, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany – and Iran. <br><br> Moscow and Tehran are far from finalizing the contract, according to Russian business daily Kommersant, which first broke the news. Nonetheless, the Obama administration has expressed distaste at the reports. <br><br> Tehran’s ambassador to Moscow Mehdi Sanaei said on Friday that the implementation of Iran-Russia energy agreements hold the key to economic expansion. <br><br> Sanaei underlined the importance of promoting of Iran-Russia cooperation and called for the implementation of oil, gas and electricity deals, according to Press TV. <br><br> Russia-Iran trade is currently worth $5 billion a year, but economists say the two countries can at least quadruple the volume of trade. </p><p> Earlier this month, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said the Islamic Republic is determined to raise the volume of its “<em>economic transactions”</em> with Russia. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155460-us-intel-officers-iraq/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pentagon quietly sends more intelligence officers to Iraq]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155460-us-intel-officers-iraq/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/40/00/us-quietly-sends-more-intelligence-officers-to-iraq.jpg" title="AFP Photo / US Army"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 20:21:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f4/40/00/us-quietly-sends-more-intelligence-officers-to-iraq.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The United States is reportedly increasing the number of intelligence officers deployed to Iraq amidst new waves of violence there being attributed to jihadists from the group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/40/00/us-quietly-sends-more-intelligence-officers-to-iraq.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / US Army" /> <p> On Friday, Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/25/us-usa-iraq-security-idUSBREA3O1YZ20140425" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Pentagon has sent an entire team of high-level American intelligence agents abroad in order to investigate reports of growing insurgency, citing two current and one former US officials familiar with the matter. </p><p> The officials, Reuters claimed, believe the ISIL “<em>now boasts territorial influence stretching from Iraq's western Anbar province to northern Syria.”</em> </p><p> An Al-Qaeda offshoot, the ISIL has for years been working towards imposing Sharia law in the parts of Iraq that are typically Sunni-majority regions. In recent days, however, those efforts have been linked to grave acts of violence that have killed dozens just over the weekend. </p><p> By Saturday, the Associated Press had <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/suicide-attack-iraq-kills-least-11-people-093405645.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that the ISIL was claiming responsibility for a bombing one day earlier that left no fewer than six people dead. The following day, ISIL was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/suicide-attack-iraq-kills-least-11-people-093405645.html" target="_blank">attributed</a> with taking the lives of 33 after an attack was waged at a political rally for a hardline Shiite group known as Asaib Ahl Al-Haq. </p><p> <em>"The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant considers the Asaib Ahl al-Haq as its enemy and that's an honor for us,"</em> the leader of the Shiite group — Qais Al-Khazali— said at a news conference, according to the AP. <em>"Our blood will not have been shed in vain and what happened will not go unpunished."</em> </p><p> But as Iraq prepares for its first elections next week since the withdrawal of American troops in 2011, further violence is likely to be seen in the coming days — once again calling into question the effectiveness of the lengthy US-led military mission there that was touted as spreading democracy, not disruptions. </p><p> According to Reuters, around 100 US military personnel have remained in Iraq since the formal exit two years ago, but now an unknown number of intel agents have been deployed there to try and determine what could arise next if fighting between groups continues. </p><p> Government sources who spoke of the deployment to Reuters declined to be identified, and a spokesperson for the White House did not respond to the agency’s requests for comment. One source told Reuters that senior US policy officials met in Washington, DC last week to discuss further action in the region, but was not sure of the outcome of the meeting. </p><p> In a separate report published over the weekend, AP journalists wrote that the United Nations believes fighting in Iraq last year claimed some 8,868 people — a tally that hasn’t been seen since the height of the US-fought war there that ended in 2011. According to the UN, more than 1,400 people have been killed in Iraq during the first two months of 2014, and violence has only intensified in recent weeks. </p><p> Ned Parker — Reuters’ Baghdad bureau chief — told National Public Radio over the weekend that the latest events are likely only a sampling of what could be seen in Iraq next. </p><p> <em>“Iraqis are anticipating violence. What happened on Friday, the bombing at the Asaib Ahl Al-Haw political rally, was really a warning, an omen of what could happen. The government has declared a week holiday for the elections and there will be a curfew. But even in 2010, the day of elections, there were bombs all over Baghdad,”</em> Parker <a href="http://boisestatepublicradio.org/post/violence-iraq-mars-runup-election" target="_blank">recalled</a>. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155360-fracking-uk-conflict-interests/</guid><title><![CDATA[UK councils have ‘conflict of interest’ on fracking - report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155360-fracking-uk-conflict-interests/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/00/00/fracking-cuadrilla-conflict-interest.jpg" title="Demonstrators hold banners during an anti-fracking protest in central London March 19, 2014.

(Reuters/Neil Hall)" /> <p> Councils that have been picked out as responsible for potential fracking areas have assets in firms by way of their pension funds, according to the report <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-local-authorities-have-conflict-of-interest-on-fracking-investments-9294590.html" target="_blank">published</a> late on Sunday. </p><p> <br> The newspaper pointed out that Lincolnshire County Council’s pension fund has 1.9 million pounds ($3.2 million) invested in French company, Total. Total was the first major oil company to make incursions into Britain with the intention of seeking shale gas profit. <br><br> The company has a 30 million pound ($50 million) holding in two exploration ventures in the northeastern county. <br><br> West Sussex County Council has some indirect investments in both Cuadrilla and3.5 million pounds in Centrica. The southern county was the site of ongoing protests in Balcombe last summer, which residents reported ‘scarred’ and ‘divided’ the village’s inhabitants after considerable opposition erupted when Cuadrilla announced proposals to drill in the county. <br><br> The council stated that its investment equated to some 0.001 percent of the total value of its £2.45bn pension fund. <em>“Any indirect investments made by the pension fund’s investment managers would not have any influence at all in determining a planning application,”</em> the council said in a statement to the paper. <br><br> Last Wednesday, Cuadrilla Resources said that it is continuing to consult with residents on proposals for two shale gas exploration sites in the Fylde area of Lancashire in northwest England. <br><br> The Greater Manchester Pension Fund (GMPF) invests on behalf of Salford and Trafford councils. The area is being tested currently for shale gas by a company named IGas. The IGas group was invested in by the Henderson group, which itself has GMPF as a shareholder. <br><br> Each body contacted by the paper maintained that the investments did not constitute a conflict of interest. However, environmental activists have voiced outrage. <br><br><em>“It’s a worrying discovery. Fracking is already a dirty enough industry without getting mired in the murky waters of conflicts of interest. Councils must disinvest and show local voters that they can be trusted to put the interests of their constituents first when making crucial decisions on fracking applications,”</em> Simon Clydesdale, energy campaigner for Greenpeace UK, told the Independent. <br><br> Lincolnshire’s assistant director of resources, David Forbes, stated: <em>“The pension scheme operates within a set of clear investment principles and is overseen by the pension committee, which makes its decisions independently from the county council.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155416-uk-barclays-libor-probe/</guid><title><![CDATA[US-based ex-Barclays staff charged by UK in Libor scandal]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155416-uk-barclays-libor-probe/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f1/80/00/uk-barclays-libor-probe.jpg" title="Reuters/Toby Melville"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:24:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f1/80/00/uk-barclays-libor-probe.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK filed its first criminal proceedings against scandal-struck US-based Libor traders on Monday over the alleged rigging of global benchmark interest rates.

The lawyers for the remaining two men were not available for comment, reported Reuters. <br><br> While the SFO confirmed that the trio are in the US, they are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court in London on May 27. The occasion could set the ball rolling for the first extradition to the UK from the US in what has been a lengthy investigation into Libor (London interbank offered rate) manipulation. <br><br> The Libor scandal dates back to 2005. Libor is the average interest rate that underpins trillions of dollars worth of loans, contracts and mortgages through the interest rates of major London banks. The scandal drew in some of the world’s biggest financial institutions, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, and Barclays. <br><br> Barclays was the first bank to settle in the wake of the rate manipulation accusations, paying some $450 million in fines in 2012 after admitting misconduct. <br><br> The subsequent backlash forced out four top Barclays directors, including chief executive Bob Diamond in 2012, who had previously insisted that he would not resign. <br><br> So far, US and European authorities have fined 10 banks and brokerages a total of $6 billion. <br><br> Twelve people are now facing criminal charges in the US and UK, among them the three from Barclays for the manipulation of denominated Libor. Twenty-two potential co-conspirators have also been identified, but not publicly named. <br><br> The charges fall at a time when a parallel investigation is underway into foreign exchange market rigging. On March 5, the Bank of England was forced to suspend a member of staff. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155452-russia-ukraine-political-repressions/</guid><title><![CDATA[Moscow slams Kiev over 'political repressions']]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155452-russia-ukraine-political-repressions/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/c0/00/1russia-ukraine-political-prisoners.jpg" title="Anti-Kiev activists hold Russian flags and shout slogans during a rally outside a regional television station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on April 27, 2014 (AFP Photo / Alexander Khudoteply)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:24:45 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f3/c0/00/1russia-ukraine-political-prisoners.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Moscow is “extremely concerned” by the Kiev regime’s “political repression and persecution” against those who dare express opposition, the Russian Foreign Ministry said calling for the release all political prisoners.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/c0/00/1russia-ukraine-political-prisoners.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Anti-Kiev activists hold Russian flags and shout slogans during a rally outside a regional television station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on April 27, 2014 (AFP Photo / Alexander Khudoteply)" /> <p> <em>“Mass media reports give us reason to speak of the start of a ‘witch hunt’, mass prosecution of dissidents and political repressions and persecutions against those who dare disagree with the Maidan [coup-imposed] authorities,”</em> Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. </p><p> It particularly recalled the case of recently arrested “people’s governor” of Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev. </p><p> <em>“We are seriously concerned about the condition of Pavel Gubarev elected ‘a people’s governor’ of Donetsk,”</em> the ministry said, adding that he was abducted, charged with organizing mass unrests and attempting to divide Ukraine, and tortured.

The question arises, whether the Kiev regime plans to drive together dissenting citizens there from the South-Eastern regions of the country,”</em> the ministry said. </p><p> If true, all that <em>“does not accord”</em> with the norms of the OSCE and the European Council as well as obligations to amnesty political prisoners and participants in the protests, which Kiev agreed to during the four-party talks on Ukraine in Geneva on April 17. </p><p> <em>“Russia calls for the immediate release of [Donetsk Region people’s governor] Pavel Gubarev and other political prisoners of the Kiev regime,”</em> the Ministry said. </p><p> It has urged the European Council, OSCE and international rights organizations to condemn in the strongest possible terms the violations of human rights in Ukraine and to press for an end to political repressions in the country. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155456-cop-wife-killed-brandon-majewski/</guid><title><![CDATA[Cop's wife kills bicyclist, then sues him for ‘emotional distress’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155456-cop-wife-killed-brandon-majewski/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/00/00/ontario-teenager-brandon-majewski-sued.jpg" title="Brandon Majewski (Image from facebook.com)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:23:07 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f4/00/00/ontario-teenager-brandon-majewski-sued.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A Canadian woman who hit three teenage boys – killing one and seriously injuring another – is now suing the deceased child, his family, and the two other teenagers she struck for more than $1 million.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/00/00/ontario-teenager-brandon-majewski-sued.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Brandon Majewski (Image from facebook.com)" /> <p> In October 2012, 17-year-old Brandon Majewski was out with his friends Richard McLean and Jake Roberts, both 16, when they decided to hop on their bikes and go out for a hot dog. On their way, Sharlene Simon, 42, struck all three of the boys with her SUV. Majewski was severely injured, and died just two hours later. </p><p> Majewski’s father, Derek Majewski, acknowledged to the Toronto Sun that the boys shouldn’t have been out so late – it was past 1 a.m. at the time of the collision – but said they are <em>“good kids”</em> and should not have been hit by the vehicle. Now that the woman behind the vehicle is suing his dead son for emotional issues, anxiety, and trauma, he was not shy about expressing his anger. </p><p> <em>“I feel like someone kicked me in the stomach — I’m over the edge,”</em> the dead boy’s father, Derek Majewski, said to the Toronto Sun. <em>“Sometimes, it makes my blood boil.”</em> </p><p> The family’s attorney, Brian Cameron, expressed similar shock over receiving news of the lawsuit. </p><p> <em>"In my 14 years of doing this, I've unfortunately represented far too many people who have lost children being hit by motorists, (and) I've never seen this,"</em> Cameron told Toronto’s CTV News Channel. <em>"I've never even heard of this … I was shocked when I got the claim."</em> </p><p> According to the lawsuit, Simon pins the blame for the accident on the teenagers themselves, with the suit stating, <em>“They did not apply their brakes properly. They were incompetent bicyclists.”</em> </p><p> Simon’s lawyer, Michael Ellis, argued his client has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder due to the incident and suffers from headaches, anxiety, depression, and emotional discomfort. Simon is suing seeking $1.3 million in damages for her <em>“great pain and suffering.”</em> </p><p> <em>"She relives the terror of this incident every day. Ms. Simon has been unable to return to work since the collision. She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She is also a victim,"</em> Ellis said, according to CTV News. </p><p> As noted by the Sun, however, the police report describing the incident shows that Simon admitted to speeding when the accident occurred. She was driving 90 km/hr in an 80 km/hr zone, and said she did not see the teenagers or the orange-red reflectors on their bikes. </p><p> Simon was being followed in a separate car by her husband, a York Regional police officer, and did not undergo a breathalyzer test, since police did not believe she was driving under the influence. Simon’s husband drove her home after the accident and no charges were filed. </p><p> The family, however, claims Simon may have been drinking and possibly on the phone when she struck the teenagers, in addition to speeding. The family had previously filed a suit seeking $900,000 in damages related to <em>“emotional trauma and shock.”</em> </p><p> <em>“I’m devastated, I’m in shock,”</em> Brandon’s mother, Venetta Mylnczyk, said to the Sun. <em>“She killed my child and now she wants to profit from it? She says she’s in pain? Tell her to look inside my head and she will see pain, she will see panic, she will see nightmares.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155312-rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[Finance and energy industries not targeted by US sanctions]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155312-rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/00/00/rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us.jpg" title="Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin (RIA Novosti/Aleksey Nikolskyi)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 18:46:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/eb/00/00/rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The third round of US sanctions do not target Russia's financial or energy sectors, but include asset freezes against 17 companies and 7 individuals, including Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/00/00/rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin (RIA Novosti/Aleksey Nikolskyi)" /> <p> All companies on the <a href="http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/" target="_blank">fresh round of sanctions</a> are owned by Gennady Timchenko, <a href="http://rt.com/business/154228-rotenberg-pipe-sales-gazprom/" target="_blank">Arkady and Boris Rotenberg</a>, or <a href="http://rt.com/business/rossiya-bank-sanctions-ruble-913/" target="_blank">Bank Rossiya</a>, which were targets of the second round, the US Treasury Department said in a <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2369.aspx" target="_blank">statement</a> on their website on Monday, April 28. </p><p> <em>"Companies have been designated on the Entity List based on a determination they are involved, or pose a significant risk of becoming involved, in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,"</em> the US Office of Congressional and Public Affairs said in a press release. </p><p> Arkady Rotenberg's bank, SMP, was <em>"ready"</em> for the sanctions, according to a bank spokesperson, who said the lending institution had already taken a number of precautions to minimize any sanction-related damage to customers. </p><p> Following the announcement of sanctions, US-based payment system MasterCard suspended its services to two Russian banks, targeted SMP and Investcapitalbank. This brings the number of Russian banks that the system has stopped working with to four. Earlier, MasterCard suspended work with Sobinbank and Bank Rossiya. International payment systems Visa and MasterCard already halted services with both SMP and Investcapitalbank in March. But back then the measure was revoked. </p><p> No publicly-listed Russian companies were included on the new sanction list, but Obama said that the US and its allies would keep broader sanctions <em>“in reserve”</em> in the event of further escalation on the ground in Ukraine. Before, US politicians <a href="http://rt.com/business/gazprom-bank-us-sanctions-768/" target="_blank">called</a> for sanctions against Russia's finance and energy sectors. </p><p> <iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/220707581/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-ivyrrsus57hz0qc8m26&amp;show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.706896551724138" id="doc_25985" name="doc_25985" frameborder="0" height="800" scrolling="no" width="600"><br></iframe> </p><h2> Sechin, Sanctioned </h2><p> Igor Sechin, the head of Russia’s biggest oil company Rosneft, is the only Russian businessman singled out by the US. </p><p> Sanctions, however, do not affect Russia’s state-owned Rosneft. </p><p> Commenting on the newly imposed sanctions, Sechin linked the measure to Rosneft’s activity and considered it as <em>“an appreciation”</em> of the company’s <em>“efficiency”.</em> </p><p> <em>“We understand that the American administration noticed the company’s active actions aimed at minimizing the risks, linked with the unilateral orientation of hydrocarbons exports to concrete regional markets,"</em> Rosneft's press office cited Sechin as saying in a statement. <em>"I take the last steps by Washington as an appreciation of the efficiency of our work."</em> </p><p> He assured Rosneft’s shareholders that the US measures against him would not affect the company’s effectiveness and stressed that the oil producer will continue cooperation with American partners. </p><p> Despite the sanctions, US oil giant ExxonMobil and Rosneft will continue to develop hydrocarbon reserves in the arctic waters of Russia. On Monday, Rosneft approved the development of two oil fields jointly with ExxonMobil at a board meeting, the company said in a statement. </p><p> Rosneft shares in Moscow fell 1.56 percent at 18:30 local Moscow time. The total market capitalization of the company is $64.7 billion. BP shares were down 1.3 percent. </p><p> By personally going after Sechin, the US has sent a message that the next round of sanctions could hit the heart of the Russian economy- the energy sector. </p><h2> BP and 'Big Oil' </h2><p> When Sechin was rumored to be on a previous EU sanction list, a spokesperson <a href="http://rt.com/business/eu-sanctions-sechin-rosneft-906/">said</a> the move was <em>"stupid"</em> and would <em>"sabotage"</em> the West, which has very tight-knit relations with 'Big Oil' companies based in the UK and US. </p><p> Rosneft is the world’s largest-listed oil company, and British Petroleum (BP) has a 19.75 percent stake, making it the biggest foreign investor in Russia's oil sector. </p><p> BP, Europe's second-largest oil company is based in the UK, but over 40 percent of assets are located in the US.BP CEO Bob Dudley has told shareholders the company remains positive about <a href="http://rt.com/business/business-usual-bp-russia-896/">business with Russia</a>. </p><p> <em>"We are considering today's announcement to see specifically what this may mean for BP,"</em> a spokesman for BP in London said, adding the company would comply with any <em>"relevant"</em> sanctions. </p><p> <em>"We are committed to our investment in Rosneft, and we intend to remain a successful, long term investor in Russia,"</em> the spokesman said. </p><p> Other individuals on the list are politicians, including Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak and Aleksey Pushkov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs. </p><p> Individuals on the new list will have their assets frozen and be denied visas to travel to the US. </p><h2> America's 'Cold War Mentality' </h2><p> Previously, the <a href="http://rt.com/news/eu-sanctions-russia-ukraine-197/">EU</a> and <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ukraine-us-russia-sanctions-129/">US</a> blacklisted dozens of Russian politicians and businessmen, freezing assets and issuing travel bans. The US also imposed sanctions on Russia’s 14th largest lender, Bank Rossiya. </p><p> The US Treasury Department's statement said the new sanctions were motivated by Russia's failure to deescalate violence in neighboring Ukraine. </p><p> Moscow maintains that further economic sanctions against Russia simply fuel the revival of a Cold War mentality and are counter-productive. Russian President Vladimir Putin has <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-west-oil-prices-136/">said</a> that Western efforts to disrupt Russia's influence over the world energy market will backfire and hurt the US. </p><p> The EU has so far not introduced a third stage of sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, as there is little consensus among member states. </p><p> On April 17, leaders from Russia, Ukraine, EU, and the US <a href="http://rt.com/news/geneva-document-ukraine-deescalation-224/" target="_blank">agreed</a> a peace plan for Ukraine in Geneva, Switzerland. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155448-microsoft-internet-explorer-0day/</guid><title><![CDATA[Internet Explorer users risk having their computers taken over]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155448-microsoft-internet-explorer-0day/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/80/00/major-security-flaw-hits-internet-explorer.jpg" title="Internet Explorer logo"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 18:45:16 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f3/80/00/major-security-flaw-hits-internet-explorer.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​A major security flaw affecting several versions of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer web browser was discovered over the weekend, and the percentage of computer users that could be compromised by the exploit is absolutely staggering.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/80/00/major-security-flaw-hits-internet-explorer.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Internet Explorer logo" /> <p> Bill Gates’ Microsoft Corp. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/security/2963983" target="_blank">announced</a> on Saturday that Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11 are all vulnerable to a glitch that when properly exploited can give hackers remote access to a victim’s computer. </p><p> When combined, versions nine through 11 of the browser accounted for 26.25 percent of all web traffic in 2013, security firm <a href="http://www.fireeye.com/blog/?p=5312" target="_blank">FireEye</a> claimed over the weekend. If all vulnerable versions are accounted for, however, then upwards of <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpcustomd=0&amp;qpsp=168&amp;qpnp=12&amp;qptimeframe=M" target="_blank">56 percent</a> of the browsers currently in use around the world are reportedly in danger of being exploited. </p><p> A person with knowledge of the vulnerability may create a fake website that, when visited, allows the hacker to exploit the bug and break into their target’s machine, Microsoft warned. </p><p> <em>"An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights,"</em> the company advised. </p><p> According to FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza, hackers had already taken advantage of the exploit by targeting unnamed US-based firms that are tied to the defense and financial sectors. </p><p> <em>"It's unclear what the motives of this attack group are, at this point,</em>” De Souza told Reuters on Sunday. <em>"It appears to be broad-spectrum intel gathering."</em> </p><p> On the official FireEye blog, security experts said that the hacking campaign has been dubbed “Operation Clandestine Fox,” and is consistent with other attacks linked to an advanced persistent threat group that has previously attracted the attention of investigators. </p><p> The unknown APT group has had access to "<em>a select number of browser-based 0-day exploits in the past</em>,” FireEye stated, but declined to publish further details. </p><p> Microsoft was unable to patch the vulnerability by the time the weekend was over, and the United States government’s Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) issued an <a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2014/04/28/Microsoft-Internet-Explorer-Use-After-Free-Vulnerability-Being" target="_blank">alert</a> warning computer users to “<em>consider employing an alternative web browser</em>.” </p><p> <em>"We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem,</em>" Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute warned in an advisory of its own. </p><p> Additionally, news of the vulnerability surfaced only weeks after Microsoft officially retired from offering security patches to its highly popular XP operating system. </p><p> <em>"XP users are not safe anymore and this is the first vulnerability that will be not patched for their system,"</em> Symantec researcher Christian Tripputi warned. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155380-ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings/</guid><title><![CDATA[Anti-Kiev protesters barricade City Hall in eastern Ukraine (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155380-ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ef/40/00/ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings.jpg" title="Pro-federalization supporters and city residents make barricades using concrete blocks near the city council  building in Konstantinovka in Donetsk Region (RIA Novosti / Mikhail Voskresensky)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 17:48:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ef/40/00/ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Anti-government protesters have seized administrative buildings, including the City Hall and prosecutor’s office in yet another city in Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine.

No violence was reported during the takeover. </p><p> Local police confirmed that a group of armed men entered the building, but deny the fact that it was seized and insists that the police office is working as usual. </p><p> <em>“Today at 06:00 am, a group of 30 unidentified armed people drove up in vans to the Konstantinovka police department and walked into the building. No weapons were used, there are no casualties,”</em> police said in a statement. </p><p> After that the men reportedly moved towards the building that hosts the City Hall and prosecutor's office, which they also took control of and hoisted the flag of the Donetsk People’s Republic. </p><p> </p><p> According to law enforcement, the people who took control of the buildings have held talks with the police. </p><p> Local media reported that protesters made no demands but called their actions <em>“preparations for the referendum”</em> that locals hope will take place on May 11. </p><p> In the meantime, anti-Kiev activists also gathered outside the City Hall. According to RT’s Paula Slier working at the scene, the mood there was <em>“jovial despite armed guns at the entrance”</em> and the crowd was clapping welcoming the move. </p><p> Some of the protesters with St. George ribbons drove trucks with concrete blocks and a construction crane to the administrative building, preparing to fortify barricades. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wxoXXItQAr4" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> Prior to that anti-government protesters blocked the entrance with sand bags and tires. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> People watching the crane at work <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Konstantinovka&amp;src=hash">#Konstantinovka</a><a href="http://t.co/ydUUG84qO6">pic.twitter.com/ydUUG84qO6</a> </p> <p> — PaulaSlier_RT (@PaulaSlier_RT) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulaSlier_RT/statuses/460729879034888192"> April 28, 2014 <br></a> </p> </blockquote><p> RT’s correspondent also saw a truck bringing a heap of sand and dumping it in front of the building. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Fortifying the barrier in front of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Konstantinovka&amp;src=hash">#Konstantinovka</a> regional govt building <a href="http://t.co/3kmmpu4c6r">pic.twitter.com/3kmmpu4c6r</a> </p> <p> — PaulaSlier_RT (@PaulaSlier_RT) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulaSlier_RT/statuses/460702841435590656"> April 28, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> As the time passed, anti-government protesters still did not voice any demands.

The photo has already been favorited by more than 14,100 people and retweeted by nearly 30,000. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> My selfie with President Obama ! <a href="http://t.co/mr94wZtmuA">pic.twitter.com/mr94wZtmuA</a> </p>— Mohd Najib Tun Razak (@NajibRazak) <a href="https://twitter.com/NajibRazak/statuses/460289899791253504">April 27, 2014</a> </blockquote><p> As noted by Time Magazine, the selfie’s emergence is a little awkward, since it came just days after Obama denied a similar request by a 13-year-old girl after speaking to US troops in South Korea. The young girl was holding a sign that read, “Mr. President may I have a selfie with you?” but Obama reportedly told the young lady that if he took a photo with her he’d have to do so with everyone else. </p><p> Regardless, some of the president’s critics just want the whole selfie-taking craze to stop completely. After the Obama/Razak photo exploded onto the internet, Fox News host Greta Van Susteran responded on Twitter asking, <em>“how much longer are ‘selfies’ going to be the fad?”</em> </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> how much longer are 'selfies' going to be the fad? </p>— Greta Van Susteren (@gretawire) <a href="https://twitter.com/gretawire/statuses/460415635588407296">April 27, 2014</a> </blockquote><p> Of course, this isn’t the first time President Obama has indulged people – or world leaders, for that matter – when it comes to the fine art of selfie-taking. At last year’s memorial service for the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, Obama was caught taking a selfie with British Prime Minster David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. As RT <a href="http://rt.com/news/obama-selfie-mandela-service-017/" target="_blank">reported</a> then, some criticized the leaders for their decision to take the photo during a funeral service. </p><p> </p><p> Meanwhile, Obama’s participation in selfies was further called into question in early April, when baseball player David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox tweeted a photo taken with the president at a White House visit. It was later revealed that the entire stunt was organized by Ortiz and smartphone maker Samsung, leading some in the administration to wonder if Obama would take any more selfies moving forward. </p><p> </p><p> <em>"As a rule the White House objects to attempts to use the president's likeness for commercial purposes, and we certainly object in this case,"</em> White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said at the time. </p><p> Just two weeks ago, though, Obama appeared in one more selfie, this time with Vice President Joe Biden, who also posted the photo online. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155428-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/</guid><title><![CDATA[US military expands presence in Philippines despite constitutional ban]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155428-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f2/40/00/us_military.jpg" title="U.S marines look for their tents as they arrive at Crow Valley for the Philippines-U.S. amphibious landing exercise dubbed Phiblex 2013 in Tarlac, north of Manila, October 9, 2012.

Aquino said the deal <em>"takes our security cooperation to a higher level of engagement, reaffirms our countries' commitment to mutual defense and security and promotes regional peace and stability."</em> </p><p> <em>“The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement serves as recognition that there is even more we can do together to support the alliance and promote peace and security in the region,”</em> added US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip S. Goldberg, according to the state-run <a href="http://news.pia.gov.ph/index.php?article=241398679339" target="_blank">Philippine Information Agency</a>. </p><p> Nevertheless, critics have suggested that the agreement is only authorizing the US to expand its influence in the region and turn the heat up on China in the midst of a <a href="http://rt.com/usa/biden-china-abe-airspace-658/" target="_blank">territory dispute</a> between Beijing officials and America’s Japanese allies concerning islands in the South China Sea. </p><p> On Monday, the Philippines’ <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/597859/what-is-the-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement-and-what-does-it-mean-for-ph" target="_blank">Inquirer</a> news outlet write that militant groups in the area are protesting the agreement because they believe it violates the local constitution on account of how it authorizes US troops to make use of island bases. Some opponents, the Inquirer added, also believe that negotiations were fast-tracked in order to be ready in time for Pres. Obama’s arrival this week. </p><p> Indeed, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement does contain rules for how the US can use military bases in the Philippines for the next ten years. At the same time, however, a provision in the contract explicitly acknowledged that the US <em>“[cannot] establish military presence or base in the Philippines”</em> by entering the agreement. Instead, local facilities will remain under control of the Philippine military, but US forces will be routinely rotated in to participate in joint training exercises. </p><p> <em>“The Philippine Constitution bars permanent US military bases, although hundreds of American military personnel have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002 to provide counterterrorism training to Filipino soldiers fighting Muslim militants,”</em> the AP acknowledged on Monday. </p><p> Other provisions of the agreement require the US to get prior consent from the Philippines before using agreed upon locations, which will remain the primary responsibility of the local government. If officials allow the US to construct and buildings or ownership during the ten-year tenure, then those facilities will also become property of the Philippines, the agreement also proclaims. </p><p> Plans to establish what bases the US will be allowed access to under the deal have yet to be revealed, but the AP speculated that a former US facility at Subic Bay could be re-opened. According to <a href="http://rt.com/news/155192-us-philippines-security-pact/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, a military source believes the US will gradually deploy combat ships, a squadron of F18s or F16s and maritime surveillance aircraft to the Philippines now that the deal has been authorized. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155392-dyncorp-afghan-reconstruction-contract/</guid><title><![CDATA[DynCorp-gate: How State Dept. wasted billions on Afghan reconstruction]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155392-dyncorp-afghan-reconstruction-contract/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f0/00/00/dyncorp.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Massoud Hossaini"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 16:25:56 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f0/00/00/dyncorp.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Department of State has spent billions on Afghan reconstruction since America’s longest-running war began there over a decade ago, but a new report reveals that the majority of that money went to a single contractor with a sordid past.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f0/00/00/dyncorp.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Massoud Hossaini" /> <p> According to that recently released <a href="http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/special%20projects/SIGAR-14-49-SP.pdf" target="_blank">write-up</a>, the United States gave $2.7 billion to Virginia-based military contractor DynCorp between 2002 and March 2013, even as the embattled firm was being berated by bad publicity brought on by a handful of scandals and mishaps. </p><p> In 2007, for example, a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR) report determined that “<em>DynCorp seemed to act almost independently of its reporting officers at the Department of State</em>,” and had billed the US government for millions of dollars for unauthorized work. In 2011, the company agreed to settle the dispute by signing a check to the State Dept. for $7.7 million, but that same year the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks published a <a href="http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/06/09KABUL1651.html" target="_blank">diplomatic cable</a> that further attracted negative attention to DynCorp by revealing that contractors hired an underage Afghan boy to entertain them. Nevertheless, DynCorp continued to take in billions from the State Dept. for contract work in both Afghanistan and <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-iraq-billion-spending-500/" target="_blank">Iraq</a>. </p><p> The latest SIGAR report — published on Thursday last week — reveals that, despite this reputation, DynCorp managed to rake in more money from the State Dept. than any other contractor. As the US prepares to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan, however, DynCorp’s efficiency is being called into question. </p><p> Of the roughly $4 billion spent by the State Dept. between 2002 and March 2013, the US awarded 1,874 contracts, grants and cooperative agreements to 771 organizations and individuals, according to the report. Of that chunk, about $3.5 billion — or 87 percent — went to supporting large, so-called "rule-of-law" projects — and almost all of that ended up being awarded to DynCorp. </p><p> The $2.7 billion in government contracts — $2,751,391,412.62, to be exact — that was awarded to DynCorp during that 11-year duration was for the primary purpose of “police development,” according to last week’s report. And as the SIGAR’s summary indicates, the sheer amount of money awarded to DynCorp far exceeds every other State Dept. contract. </p><p> <em>“The top recipient of State reconstruction funding by total awards was Dyncorp International Limited Liability Corporation (Dyncorp),”</em> the SIGAR report reads<em>. “Dyncorp received approximately $2.8 billion in contracts, accounting for 69 percent of total State Department reconstruction awards.”</em> The firm that received the second-most money from the State Dept. through contractors was PAE Government Services Incorporated at $597.8 million — or about one-fourth of what DynCorp received. The next company on the list was awarded only one-tenth of that. </p><p> But were the billions dished out for law enforcement operations in Afghanistan even worth it? The latest SIGAR report notes that <em>“Dyncorp contracts dealt principally with training and equipping the Afghan National Police and counternarcotics forces,”</em> and <em>“included police trainers, construction of police infrastructure and fielding police equipment and vehicles.</em>” Last November it was reported that Afghan opium production has only <a href="http://rt.com/news/afghanistan-opium-un-warlords-657/" target="_blank">surged</a>, and just last week three American civilians were killed as the result of an attack in Kabul. According to the <a href="http://icasualties.org/oef/" target="_blank">iCasualties.org</a> website, 16 US troops have died so far this year in Afghanistan. </p><p> Neil Gordon, an investigator with the DC-based Project on Government Oversight transparency group, asked in an <a href="http://www.pogo.org/blog/2014/04/20140424-meet-the-3-largest-recipients-of-state-dept-afghan-aid.html" target="_blank">article</a> published last week if it made sense to but a firm with such a “colorful past” at the helm of reconstruction efforts. DynCorp, Gordon wrote, has previously been linked to “instances of <em>labor smuggling</em>,<em>weak performance and over payments</em> on a base support services contract,<em>botched construction work</em> on an Afghan Army garrison and <em>lawsuits filed by disgruntled subcontractors</em>.” Nevertheless, they’ve remained the State Department’s go-to guys when it comes to Afghan contracts. </p><p> State Dept. whistleblower Peter Van Buren <a href="http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2014/04/28/state-department-gives-87-of-afghan-funds-to-only-five-recipients/" target="_blank">wrote</a> for Firedoglake this week that he thinks these massive contractors several implications, in his opinion. </p><p> <em>“The smallest issue seems to be the massive hemorrhaging of money into just one corporate pocket. Given the amounts, one looks forward to future SIGAR reporting about how this came to be. How many non-competed contracts? How many insider deals? How much unaccounted for money? The appearance of corruption, as well as the opportunities for corruption, are evident,”</em> Van Buren wrote. </p><p> <em>“The next issue of course is what, if anything, was accomplished with all that taxpayer money absent enriching a few large corporations. Pick your trend line, and it is hard to find much bang for the buck(s) in Afghanistan,”</em> he added. </p><p> Van Buren isn’t the only one that has raised objections recently about US money in Afghanistan, either: earlier this month, a letter from SIGAR's general counsel accused the US Agency for International Developmentof having “<em>covered up information</em>” that showed that the Afghan government has been largely unable to account for cash or resources provided through US support endeavors. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155424-donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters/</guid><title><![CDATA[Blasts, fierce fighting in Donetsk between pro- and anti-Kiev demos (VIDEO, PHOTOS)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155424-donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f2/00/00/donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters.jpg" title="Photo from Twitter/@GrahamWP_UK"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 16:14:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f2/00/00/donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />There's gunfire, explosions and brutal clashes in the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine as fighting erupted between pro- and anti-govt protesters, RT’s stringer reports from the scene.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f2/00/00/donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo from Twitter/@GrahamWP_UK" /> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Video in a minute, pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine demos have met, and it's ugly. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Donetsk&amp;src=hash">#Donetsk</a><a href="http://t.co/ODfvGmhHHk">pic.twitter.com/ODfvGmhHHk</a> </p> <p> — GrahamWPhillips (@GrahamWP_UK) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamWP_UK/statuses/460810128896163842">April 28, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> 14 people have asked for medical assistance, with several hospitalized, after clashes in Donetsk, the regional administration told Interfax-Ukraine news agency. <br><br> According to Novosti Donbassa (Donbas News), eight people have been taken to the city’s Kalinin hospital after violence broke out. <br><br> The website also reports of a policeman being shell-shocked due to handmade grenade exploding near him. </p><p> Pro- and-anti-Kiev protest rallies took place simultaneously in the city. </p><p> According to RT’s stringer Graham Phillips, there were plenty of masked young men on both sides, and they were clearly looking for a fight. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-L4k62QabIM" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> The police failed to contain the crowd as protesters clashed with each other, using firecrackers, smoke grenades, baseball bats and sticks. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Po9op0k4WYs" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> A group of about 1,000 “neo-Nazi thugs” has come to Donetsk from Dnepropetrovsk on Monday to cause provocations, the press-service of the self-proclaimed People’s Republic of Donetsk told RT. <br><br><em>“We were expecting an attack.

Non-fatal shootings also occurred, including a drive-by that injured four men who were standing on a sidewalk. </p><p> The first of the weekend’s fatalities occurred Friday evening, when 32-year-old Leonore Draper was found shot inside of a parked vehicle in the West Pullman neighborhood, about an hour after she reportedly left an anti-violence event. Local residents told police they heard gunshots around 10:30 p.m. </p><p> When police found Draper – a Chicago Public Schools budget analyst – she had suffered gunshot wounds to her chest and arm. She was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead just after 12:30 a.m. Police told the Sun-Times they are looking into the possibility that the incident was a drive-by. </p><p> Around 1:15 a.m. on Saturday, 21-year-old Martarvian Emery was at home with a 19-year-old woman when an unknown individual standing outside opened fire. The assailant fatally shot Emery in the chest, who was declared dead at the scene, and also wounded the woman in the leg. She was taken to a hospital and is in stable condition, according to the Chicago Tribune. </p><p> A little more than an hour later, Jaquez Williams, 17, was declared dead in the Austin neighborhood on Chicago’s West Side. Williams was standing outside when an unknown individual approached him and shot him in the head. </p><p> The most recent death occurred on early Sunday morning, when Cindy Bahena, 21, was shot and killed in the back seat in the back seat of a car being driven by a known gang member. According to the Sun-Times, police News Affair Officer Hector Alfaro said multiple men were standing near the car when one of them began shouting gang slogans and fired shots at the vehicle. </p><p> Bahena is not believed to be the intended target of the shooting. She was taken to a hospital but declared dead at 12:47 a.m. </p><p> Even before the past weekend’s fatalities were being tallied, the Tribune reported deadly encounter between an off-duty police officer and his 86-year-old neighbor on Friday afternoon. According to police, an argument between the two parties escalated when the neighbor shot and wounded the officer’s wife. This caused the officer to fatally shoot the man, and subsequently shoot and injure the neighbor’s wife when she reportedly attempted to reach for her husband’s shotgun. </p><p> No arrests have been made in connection to any of these crimes, though authorities say they are investigating. </p><p> These events are just the latest in a string of deadly weekends in Chicago. As RT <a href="http://rt.com/usa/dead-injured-chicago-violence-820/" target="_blank">reported previously</a>, Easter weekend saw shootings take the lives of 9 people and injure 32 others. At the time, the city had seen 288 people victimized by shootings since the start of 2014. In 2013, approximately 2,100 people were involved in shootings. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155368-hitler-parallel-washington-post/</guid><title><![CDATA[Hitler parallel debate rages in Washington Post]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155368-hitler-parallel-washington-post/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/80/00/hitler-parallel-washington-post.jpg" title="The Washington Post headquarters in Washington (Reuters/Stelios Varias)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 15:24:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ee/80/00/hitler-parallel-washington-post.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The head of a prominent Russian think tank is battling it out on the pages of the Washington Post over what he calls “disturbing” views attributed to him regarding the historical nature of Hitler’s Nazi regime and recent events that transpired in Crimea.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/80/00/hitler-parallel-washington-post.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="The Washington Post headquarters in Washington (Reuters/Stelios Varias)" /> <p> The whole firestorm erupted over an article written by Andranik Migranyan, who heads up the New York office of the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation, for Izvesti earlier this month. </p><p> Dismissing critics who had likened Russian President Vladimir Putin to the notorious Nazi leader, Migranyan <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/568603" target="_blank">said</a>: <em>“One must distinguish between Hitler before 1939 and Hitler after 1939.

In the article Mr. Cohen cited, I wrote that Hitler ‘became known as one of the greatest evildoers in history because he set before himself and Germany’s people the delusional idea of world domination, proclaimed entire peoples to be inferior, tried to establish the superiority of the Aryan race over other, less worthy races and made it his goal to exterminate tens of millions of Slavs, Jews, Gypsies and other ethnicities,</em>” he said. </p><p> <em>“It is precisely these delusional ideas that led to Hitler’s and all Germans’ dismal end.’ The central point of my article was that Hitler’s unique evil made it inappropriate to compare his actions to what happened in Crimea. Mr. Cohen’s column did not reflect my views.”</em> </p><p> Noting how his own family suffered as a result of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Migranyan said he will <em>“always reject Hitler and his methods.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155364-ukraine-nazi-division-march/</guid><title><![CDATA[Neo-Nazis march in Lvov 'in honor' of Ukrainian Waffen SS division (PHOTOS)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155364-ukraine-nazi-division-march/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/40/00/ukraine-ss-division-march.jpg" title="Ukrainian ultra-nationalists carry emblems of 14th SS-Volunteer Division &quot;Galician&quot; as they march in the center of the western city of Lviv on April 27, 2014 to mark the 71st anniversary of 14th SS-Volunteer Division &quot;Galician&quot; foundation.

It’s very difficult for any leader to deal under that cloud,”</em> Kerry said, according to The Daily Beast. </p><p> However, he added that both Israel and Palestine share the blame for the current impasse in the peace talks. Along with Israel, he also denounced the Palestinian authorities, who don’t recognize the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. </p><p> <em>“There’s a period here where there needs to be some regrouping. I don’t think it’s unhealthy for both of them to have to stare over the abyss and understand where the real tensions are and what the real critical decisions are that have to be made,”</em> Kerry said. <em>“Neither party is quite ready to make it at this point in time. That doesn’t mean they don’t have to make these decisions.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> The US seldom criticizes its top Middle East ally. However, US officials have made a number of harsh remarks recently. In November 2013, Kerry warned Israel about increased isolation, while in February he warned Israel that a failure in the peace talks could lead to a global boycott of the Jewish state. </p><p> State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki tried to clarify Kerry’s comments to The Daily Beast. </p><p> According to Psaki, US Secretary of State was simply repeating the view expressed by others about a two-state solution. </p><p> <em>“Secretary Kerry, like Justice Minister Livni … was reiterating why there's no such thing as a one-state solution if you believe, as he does, in the principle of a Jewish State. He was talking about the kind of future Israel wants and the kind of future both Israelis and Palestinians would want to envision,”</em> she said. </p><p> Apartheid was a system of racial segregation in South Africa in the period between 1948 and 1994. </p><p> The system classified the country’s residents into racial groups; <em>"black", "white", "colored", and "Indian."</em> Black people were deprived of their citizenship, legally becoming citizens of one of 10 tribally based self-governing homelands. The government also segregated education, medical care, beaches, and other public services, and provided black people with services inferior to those of white people. </p><p> According to the 1998 Rome Statute, the <em>"crime of apartheid”</em> is defined as <em>“inhumane acts… committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.”</em> </p><p> Previously United Nations investigators and human rights advocates also accused Israel of committing the crime of apartheid. </p><p> </p><p> In 2004 John Dugard, then UN's Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories described the situation in the West Bank as <em>"an apartheid regime ... worse than the one that existed in South Africa."</em> </p><p> In 2009 Irish peace activist and Nobel peace laureate Mairead Maguire criticized Israel for <em>"racist and apartheid policies of siege, occupation and militarization of both Israel and Palestinian villages and towns."</em> </p><p> Relations between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority have deteriorated dramatically over the past month, culminating in the imposition of sanctions on Palestine by Israel. </p><p> The sanctions included the freezing the transfer of all taxes collected in Israel to Palestine. Israel monthly collects some $110 million in taxes on goods bound for the Palestinian territory, which roughly amounts to around two-thirds of the income received by the Palestinian Authority. </p><p> Negotiations between the two sides took a turn for the worse at the beginning of April, when Abbas submitted applications to join 15 international conventions, prompting a sharp condemnation from Israel, which branded the move as unilateral step toward statehood and a violation of the terms of negotiation. </p><p> In response, Israel refused to carry out scheduled prisoner releases. </p><p> On April 23, Israel suspended peace talks with Palestine over the unity deal signed in Gaza between Hamas group (considered terrorist in Israel) and Abbas's Fatah faction. </p><p> Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said that Palestine must choose with either peace with Israel or an alliance with Hamas, but he cannot have both. </p><p> </p><p> Israel and the Palestinian Authority now face an April 29 deadline to resolve their differences and make headway with bilateral talks before Washington withdraws its support. </p><p> Meanwhile, Palestine is currently pursuing attempt to become a full member of the world community and seeks membership in at least 60 United Nations bodies and international agreements, AFP reported, citing a statement from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). </p><p> The Palestine Liberation Organization's central council <em>"affirms the need for the Palestinian leadership to continue membership of UN agencies and international conventions,"</em> the Palestine People's Party secretary general Bassam al-Salhi said in a statement. </p><p> Palestine has been an official UNESCO member since 2011. In 2012 the country became an observer state member of the UN with an overwhelming vote in favor. Though the Palestinian mission cannot vote on UN resolutions, it can vote in elections for judges on international courts. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155396-turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Re-definition of Turkey over Armenian Genocide]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155396-turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/f0/40/00/turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia.jpg" title="Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan (Reuters/Umit Bektas)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 14:44:03 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/f0/40/00/turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The past is a foreign country goes the quote that has now become nothing but a well-worn cliché.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/f0/40/00/turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan (Reuters/Umit Bektas)" /> <p> In today's Turkey most people would probably agree with the sentiment, as "Ottomania" is all the rage and a self-professed interest in history (meaning Ottoman history) has become something akin to a national obsession – a fascination expressed in high ratings for television programs showcasing various personalities of differing academic (and/or political) persuasions pontificate about this or that titbit of Ottoman minutiae. Even the Turkish soap opera industry has become subject to this Ottoman fad, leading to such travesties as "The Magnificent Century" acquainting the public-at-large with well-known yet strangely unknown facts of 'national' history – as when the nation suddenly realized that the universally well-loved Sultan Süleyman (the 'Magnificent' one, after all) had his first-born son Mustafa murdered in cold blood. But apart from such quasi-spontaneous history lessons, the primary purpose of the current love of all things Ottoman sweeping the Turkey is clearly escapist in nature. At the same time, however, the government cunningly utilizes the people's escapist tendencies to push through its own agenda, an agenda that attempts to rewrite certain aspects of Turkish (if not Ottoman) history while, simultaneously, stressing the Islamic nature of the Republic and its imperial predecessor. Decades of Kemalist propaganda and indoctrination have succeeded in equating the terms 'Ottoman" and 'Islamic' in the Turkish mind. </p><p> In Turkey every year the approach of the month of April is accompanied by frantic lobbying activities across the pond (meaning millions of dollars well-spent) and public proclamations of Turkish (or Muslim) innocence at home. The reason for this recurring series of events has to do with a troubling episode in recent Ottoman history, and the question whether Turks (in reality, Ottoman policy-makers and their subject Muslim citizens) living in the early 20th-century did commit a series of crimes against humanity, culminating in genocide, or to be more precise terminating in the "Armenian Genocide". Throughout the post-war period, the Turkish authorities have continuously upheld that Turks could not have committed such an atrocious crime, but instead the then-Istanbul authorities had merely taken drastic relocation measures against an Armenian uprising in eastern Anatolia in view of Armenian complicity in Russian military ventures against the Ottoman state in the course of the Great War (subsequently known as World War I, 1914-18). </p><p> In this context, the role of the United States' Congress has always been of paramount importance. This year marked a departure from that clichéd path, as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives John Boehner gave assurance to Turkey, on 15 April, that Congress will not get involved in any "Armenian genocide" bill – well ahead of the dreaded April 24th, the Genocide Remembrance Day, when in 1915 the first Armenian victims of the Ottoman policy of ethnic cleansing were deported from Istanbul. Boehner visited Turkey as part of a multi-country trip to the region (also visiting Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates), accompanied by a high-level congressional delegation. </p><p> In Ankara, John Boehner met the Speaker of the Turkish Parliament Cemil Cicek, and afterwards told reporters that "[t]he issue about Armenians comes onto the [Congress'] agenda from time to time. Don't worry. Our Congress will not get involved in this issue, we are not writing history, we are also not historians." Boehner went on to say that the US tries to improve bilateral ties with Ankara, while expressing his appreciation for Turkish support on such hot-button issues like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p> In return, Cicek waxed lyrically about Turkey and America, indicating that the Armenian issue constitutes a "burden" in bilateral relations between the two allies. In this instance, Cicek undoubtedly had the US Senate's Resolution 410, passed on 4 April, in mind. The resolution proclaims "that the President should ensure that US foreign policy reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the US record relating to the Armenian Genocide." </p><p> The Republican-controlled House clearly favors business-as-usual with Turkey, arguably continuing to buy more American arms and weapons as in the previous year when Turkey's top spot on the destination list for US-manufactured arms was followed by Egypt and South Korea. The Democrat-controlled Senate, on the other hand, appears to follow its conscience, accepting the Resolution this year, the first time in a quarter century that such a clear stance was taken by the US legislative chamber. As a result of the House's refusal to get involved in the Armenian issue, however, the bicameral legislature of the United States of America that is the US Congress did not adopt a binding resolution. The bill thus failed to reach the floor on the last working day before a two-week Easter recess (11 April), giving Boehner ample reason to include Turkey on his business trip to the Middle East. </p><h2> ‘Shying away historical reality’ </h2><p> With regards to the Armenian issue, 2014 marked a clear departure for Turkey on the domestic front as the popular yet divisive Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan decided to take a truly "unprecedented" step: on the Wednesday prior to the Genocide Remembrance Day, not by accident coinciding with the National Sovereignty and Children's Day in Turkey (23 April), the Prime Minister’s office issued a written statement regarding the Armenian issue, carrying his personal signature. It was published on the Prime Minister's website in several languages, including Turkish, English, and French, but also Armenian, Arabic, and Russian, among others. The text was not the outcome of a rushed decision, but clearly the result of a painstaking editorial process. Even though the letter starts off with the statement that the Remembrance Day "provides a valuable opportunity to share opinions freely on a historical matter", arguably in line with traditional Turkish protestations that the whole matter is an historical issue, best left to historians, its following lines appear unprecedented if not groundbreaking. </p><p> The Prime Minister's letter treads carefully, unwilling to offend fervent Turkish nationalists, stating that "[m]illions of people of all religions and ethnicities lost their lives in the First World War. Having experienced events which had inhumane consequences – such as relocation – during the First World War, should not prevent Turks and Armenians from establishing compassion and mutually humane attitudes towards one another." </p><p> In the next instance, however, Tayyip Erdogan pulls out all the stops, announcing that "[i]n today’s world, deriving enmity from history and creating new antagonisms are neither acceptable nor useful for building a common future"; followed by the letter's pièce de résistance, "[i]t is our hope and belief that the peoples of an ancient and unique geography, who share similar customs and manners will be able to talk to each other about the past with maturity and to remember together their losses in a decent manner. And it is with this hope and belief that we wish that the Armenians who lost their lives in the context of the early twentieth century rest in peace, and we convey our condolences to their grandchildren". </p><p> Shying away from actually acknowledging the historical reality of the "Armenian Genocide", Erdogan has now become the first Turkish politician to concede that the Ottoman policy of ethnic cleansing had disastrous consequences for the Armenian population of Anatolia, an "ancient and unique geography". One could argue that this concession is but the first step down the road to full acknowledgment of the genocidal results of the Ottoman population policy that attempted to transform Anatolia, the Ottoman heartland, into a purely Muslim entity. In fact, looking at the historical record, it seems that the Ottomans (or rather the Unionists or so-called Young Turks in charge of the Empire during the period 1908-18) had all but relied on actions previously carried out by their German allies to realise their goal of a Muslim homeland in Anatolia. Even though many commentators and even historians refer to the Armenian issue as the 20th century's first genocide, in reality the German Empire under Kaiser Wilhelm II (1888-1918) had already constituted a precedent previously. </p><p> </p><p> The Dutch historian Jan-Bart Gewald, matter-of-factly relates that "[b]etween 1904 and 1908 Imperial German troops committed genocide in German South West Africa (GSWA), present-day Namibia." Germany's late and short ("about thirty-five years", as expressed by the sociologist Gurminder K. Bhambra) entry into Europe's colonial game overseas led to extreme measures. In South West Africa, German settlers employed the Herero-German war to 'rightfully' occupy territory belonging to the Herero tribes. This land-grab was preceded by "the planned and officially sanctioned attempted extermination of the Herero people". As the Ottomans had enjoyed good relations with the German Empire ever since the early years of Sultan Abdülhamid II (1876-1909), it would stand to reason to assume that the Unionists were eager to apply the German experiences in South West Africa to their own territorial designs for Anatolia. As outlined in an <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/turkey-kurdish-issue-2023-936/" target="_blank">earlier piece</a> of mine, the Unionists' policies of social engineering "were aimed at transforming Anatolia (the heartland of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic’s geo-body, using Thongchai Winichakul’s coinage denoting the territory of a nation as expressed on a map and inscribed on the people’s consciousness) into a Muslim homeland where refugees from the Russian Empire and the Balkans were settled. Prior to the formulation of Turkish nationalism as an ideological binding-force [in 1922], the diverse ethnic groups in Anatolia were united by their common identity as Muslims and their allegiance to the Ottoman Caliphate, abolished in 1924". </p><p> As a result, the fact that Turkey's PM Erdogan used this year's Children's Day, the Turkish public holiday that commemorates the first opening of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (the nation's parliament) in Ankara in 1920, to express his condolences to the Armenian nation, is not coincidental. Turkish critics of the PM have oftentimes expressed their misgivings about Erdogan's apparent desire to return Turkey and its government to its original inception three years' prior to the foundation of the Republic and the Turkish nation state. When the original Grand National Assembly was founded, its constituency consisted of Anatolian Muslims. The concept of a Turkish nation in Anatolia was introduced in 1922, and, as I expressed in my earlier piece, "[o]pponents of Erdogan and the AKP now fear that the government’s long-term goal ... is to transform the nation state Turkey into an Anatolian federation of Muslim ethnicities, possibly linked to a revived caliphate." Against this backdrop, Tayyip Erdogan's condolences to the Armenian nation appear like a preamble to establishing a new (or old) definition of Anatolia (or Turkey) as an "ancient and unique geography" inhabited solely by Muslim population groups. Acknowledging the reality that Christian populations, like the Armenians, once formed part of Anatolia's social mix is but a prelude to recognising that today's Anatolians are all Muslim, and will remain so forever. </p><p> In other words, as the US pragmatically continues to dodge the Armenian bullet, Turkey's AKP leadership seems bent on continuing its long-term policy goals that could lead to a re-definition of Turkey. Will the Turkish nation state eventually become an Anatolian federation of Muslim ethnicities? Does Erdogan's expression of grief signal his ultimate goal of becoming the Turkish leader who revived Anatolia's commitment to the cause of the Prophet and will Turkey of the future look like the Anatolia of the past? </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155376-muslim-brotherhood-trials-egypt/</guid><title><![CDATA[Political cleansing in Egypt is full speed ahead]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155376-muslim-brotherhood-trials-egypt/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ef/00/00/muslim-brotherhood-trials-egypt.jpg" title="Relatives and families of supporters of ousted President Mohamed Mursi do the Rabaa sign near security forces, after hearing the sentence handed to Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and other Brotherhood supporters, at the court in Minya, south of Cairo April 28, 2014.

(Reuters)" /> <p> On April 28 an Egyptian court sentenced Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Mohamed Badie and 682 of its supporters to death. They faced charges of murder and attempted murder of several policemen during riots by Morsi supporters in the southern province of Minya on August 14 last year. Just a month ago, the same judge, Said Youssef, <a href="http://rt.com/news/155284-egypt-court-death-penalty/" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to death 529 supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi after just a two-day trial. All but 37 defendants had their sentences commuted to life. President Morsi was removed by the military last July and since then Egypt has seen large scale persecution and elimination of Muslim Brotherhood members. </p><p> The recent verdict turned out to be a real shock for the international community, with many voices calling for external involvement aimed at stopping bloodshed and cleansing. The news has stirred up social media.

Defense lawyer Ahmed Hefni told reporters outside the court that the death sentences now will be submitted to Egypt's Mufti for the approval, the highest religious authority, but his decision is mostly a formality and is not legally binding. </p><h2> MB goes underground </h2><p> The Muslim Brotherhood has been labeled an illegal organization, with over 16,000 members arrested or killed. After taking power for the first time in 2012, the Muslim Brotherhood now has to go underground. Moreover, as Egypt plunges into a new era of even more bloody dictatorship it presents the severest challenge to the state’s stability since the time of Nasser. The Brothers are being forced to resort to violence and reorganize into a quasi-militia to protect their members. The possibility of a new wave of deadly attacks carried out by Brothers shouldn’t be ruled out. </p><p> It’s obvious that there is no room for justice in Egypt now. The UN and human rights activists have denounced the speedy character of the trials, though it seems to be ignored by Egypt’s authorities. Many of those accused are believed not to have been present at the riots near police stations. </p><p> </p><p> Lack of proof, extremely fast trials with no access by the families of the defendants, limited options of punishment, namely life sentence and death – all these speak for themselves. The ruling authorities are continuing a violent crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood who represent a significant force in Egypt. In other words, it seems that the military, headed by al-Sisi who is expected to be the “winner” at the presidential polls, are pursuing a policy of political cleansing, paving the way for themselves, and getting rid of any strong rivals…or rivals in general. </p><h2> Who is next? </h2><p> On the same day, April 28, an Egyptian court banned all April 6 Movement activities inside Egypt and ordered the confiscation of its headquarters. </p><p> The April 6 Youth Movement is an opposition political movement founded in 2008 by a number of young people in support of a general strike held then by textile workers of Al-Mahalla, the largest city of the Gharbiya governorate, which is about 80 km north of Cairo. April 6 played a significant role in the January 25 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak in 2011. It also opposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, arguing he did not fulfill his presidential campaign promises, and protested against the military regime installed after Morsi’s overthrow. The case against April 6 was filed by lawyer Ashraf Said who is accusing the movement of defaming the country’s image and colluding with foreign parties. Its leader Ahmed Maher is already serving a three-year jail term for violating a law that bans all but police-sanctioned protests. </p><p> Hence, one more political player in Egypt is under attack. While nobody knows how the case against the April 6 movement would end up, and so it makes any adversaries of military rule think they could be next. </p><p> <em>Irina Sukhoparova, RT</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155372-tornado-mayflower-arkansas-twister/</guid><title><![CDATA[Mayflower Arkansas devastation: Deadly tornado destroys everything in its path]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155372-tornado-mayflower-arkansas-twister/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/c0/00/tornado-mayflower-arkansas-storm.jpg" title="A damaged vehicle is seen amid debris after a tornado hit the town of Mayflower, Arkansas around 7:30 pm CST, late April 27, 2014.

Now Kabul is asking them not to leave Afghanistan so that the Taliban will not attack them,” a Pashtun from Kabul in his Moscow shop muses.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/c0/00/afghanistan.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="" /> <p> <em>“Just imagine: we had 44 countries invading Afghanistan with modern weapons, satellite monitoring, tanks and missiles. The Taliban has an army of less than 20,000. We have 400,000 Afghan troops and 200,000 Americans with the most advanced weaponry. How is it possible that they can’t prevail over the Taliban?”</em> he says. </p><p> A PhD-qualified engineer by profession, he trades a range of Oriental items from hookahs to incense sticks. We’ve been talking about the elections for two hours, with visitors coming in and leaving without being served, and other Afghans joining our discussion with eagerness. </p><p> There are only a handful of places in Moscow where you can get a glimpse of people from different Afghan tribes and social strata. One of them is a former hotel in the city suburbs housing a multitude of shops and firms owned by Afghans. They all retain close ties with their homeland, make regular visits and keep daily contact with their families and business partners. </p><p> Those who do business in Russia usually have quite a good background and a decent profession. They work here despite the fact the clans they come from fought the Soviet army in 1979-1989. But that was a long time ago. The US army has been in Afghanistan for 13 years and Afghans do not have much respect for either the Americans or those who they support. </p><h2> Endangered elections </h2><p> Elections in the east are being increasingly associated with terror acts and mysterious problems with vote counting. </p><p> Ironically, political analysts may soon pick up some of the language used by journalists. The developments in Afghanistan and Iraq indicate that elections in a country with a US troop presence are always hailed as success, while a vote in a country left by US troops merely serves as a backdrop for terror attacks. </p><p> Curiously enough, in the old Western democracies the elites negotiate before the elections, whereas in Afghanistan, it looks like the election comes prior to negotiations. This seems to be the only explanation as to why it takes them almost three weeks to count the votes, and why they’ve postponed the announcement of the results for the 4th time. The election took place on April 5 and the votes were supposed to be counted by April 24. Then it was postponed to May 14, so that the second round could start on May 28. </p><p> I’d like to remind that four years ago, it took Iraq a record four months to count the votes from its election. The current prime minister stayed in office, but his bloc in the parliament lost one vote to the opposition. </p><p> The behind-the-scenes struggle continues in Afghanistan. It would be naïve to believe that the Afghan independent commission is unable to count quickly. The clans and advisers just didn’t rush it, as they were fighting for the second round and for the difference in votes. </p><p> Right now this difference has become more distinct, when the conventional anti-Americanism pole represented by Abdullah Abdullah got the upper hand over the most pro-American candidate, Ashraf Ghani. </p><p> </p><p> This division is quite feeble though. Before the election they both had stated that they supported the presence of the US troops in the country. Whereas President Karzai finished his tenure with a patriotic gesture of refusing to sign the agreement for the US troop presence. He also took his brother off the presidential candidates’ list and directed his supporters to unlikely candidate Zamlai Rassoul. </p><p> At the moment, according to another preliminary count, Abdullah Abdullah wins this election. He looks more or less remote from the occupation forces compared to other candidates. His name is associated with Ahmad Shakh Massoud, who was mysteriously murdered on September 11, 2001. Many believe he was a Mujahideen physician, if not a Mujahideen himself. </p><p> Abdullah does have a flaw in his biography. From the viewpoint of a Pashtun, the main Afghan tribe, he is a Tajik, as is his mother. <em>“Can a Tajik rule Afghanistan?”</em> This is something any Pashtun would ask you, unless they are related to the occupation forces. Moreover, his name is related to the reputation of the Afghan Northern Alliance, which welcomed the US presence and had close cooperation with it. </p><p> However, for Afghans one’s origin isn’t the main concern. More importantly, these people who really value their independence feel that they have been invaded, in spite of the elections, speeches and promises. The behind-the-scenes war which they sense more clearly than the foreign observers do is a part of this invasion. </p><h2> Difficult choice </h2><p> What do the Afghan people think of the election? Most of the Moscow-based Afghans are happy to discuss it, but they don’t want their pictures taken. </p><p> Young Pashtuns aren’t very optimistic. I am talking to a Pashtun from Herat. He says he preferred Mohammad Ismail Khan, if anyone. He may be a Tajik but he is a Mujahideen, Herat-born and had been its governor for a long time. </p><p> <em>“Otherwise they all are crooks, and all they want is to sell out to the Americans,”</em> he says about the presidential candidates. </p><p> I ask him to clarify what’s there to sell in Afghanistan, as none of the shops have any Afghan products. </p><p> <em>“What’s there to sell? The whole of Afghanistan,”</em> he answers. </p><p> Most Afghans are convinced that their country is a crucial strategic center that the US wants to have just for the sake of it. </p><p> A Pashtun from Kabul has no respect for either of the candidates. He believes there was no voter turnout at all. Some of his family members did go to vote, and they told him there was no frenzy there. </p><p> A Pashtun called Nabi was born in Laghman. He had spent 10 years in prison during the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. He is an Afghan Marxist, and as most supporters of one Marxist fraction he became imprisoned when the other fraction got the upper hand. Just like many older Afghans, he is an underground revolutionary, a fighter, and a political prisoner who got self-educated while in prison, and his opinions are quite harsh. </p><p> The reason he doesn’t support Abdullah is not the fact that he is a Tajik. <em>“Hekmatyar is a Pashtun, but he is also a traitor, just like Abdullah is. And so is Sayyaf - a Pashtun and a traitor,”</em> he says. Marxists are very open about using strong terms. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“Abdullah bears the shadow of a traitor, as he had cooperated with everyone, just like his commander, Massoud,”</em> says Nabi. <em>“His people sold our concessions for mineral deposits extraction.”</em> </p><p> Nabi prefers Ghani, even though he bears <em>“a stamp of the American past.”</em> </p><p> Khusrow, a Tajik from Herat, openly chooses Abdullah because he is Tajik. </p><p> <em>“His mother is Tajik, so Pashtuns regard him as a stranger,”</em> he says. <em>“They say that he, who shakes hands with the ruler, will come to power too,”</em> he is trying to say that those people who are on a first-name basis with the authorities are well connected. </p><p> <em>“Abdullah will definitely get more votes, but such people as Abdullah can never be president. So Ghani is more likely to become the leader,”</em> he sadly says. <em>“Pashtuns will always rule in Afghanistan, and all the others will play football and fight,”</em> Khusrow predicts. </p><p> His Tajik friend who comes from Kabul has moved his family to India. </p><p> <em>“I’m not into politics. We didn’t vote for anyone – there is nobody worth voting for.”</em> </p><p> The Hazara brothers, Ysa and Nadyr, are split. Nadyr supports Abdullah out of principle. </p><p> <em>“Pashtuns didn’t like the Taliban people as well, although they were Pashtuns too. I support Abdullah, not because he is Pashtun, but because he plans for the future,”</em> he says. </p><p> He likes it that Abdullah participates in elections together with Mouhakkik who is Hazara. </p><p> <em>“He has always been a part of our society, he gets us. He has been our leader for a long time. I think Abdullah will win. Ghani’s deputy Sarwar Danesh is Hazara too. He is pro-Iranian, unlike Mouhakkik, who is not so pro-Iranian. But we just want him to help his people – that’s what matters.”</em> </p><p> He hopes Abdullah can make a good president because he is slightly against Pakistan and against the USA. </p><p> Ysa doesn’t agree. <em>“Ghani is very experienced. He is like Putin, who looks ahead.”</em> </p><p> And that’s when Ysa thinks about the flipside. </p><p> <em>“I once asked a politician, why Russia doesn’t supply its missiles to Iran or Syria. He said it’s a policy. Politicians are not trustworthy – today they think this way, the next day they change their mind. Sayyaf had an agreement with the Hazara too, but eventually they got no protection. So the policy is like that: today we are friends, tomorrow we are foes.”</em> </p><p> He has no doubt that Ghani is going to win in the second round of the elections. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“Do you think Ghani will bring another USA? It was already brought [to Afghanistan] 13 years ago,”</em> Nadyr argues. </p><p> <em>“The Americans spent $600 billion in Afghanistan so they will not let us go. They went there to prop up their positions against Russia, China and Central Asia. The US has plans in Afghanistan for 50 years ahead. They will leave at least 10,000 troops there for sure. Ghani appeals to them simply because he is pro-American,”</em> Nadyr says. </p><p> Many people in Afghanistan believe the Taliban has been created and imposed by the US too, and it was aimed at taking over the country. Nadyr and Ysa have no doubts about that. </p><p> <em>“Some of Ghani’s advisors speak out against the Hazara all the time. Moreover, his wife is not a Muslim, she’s from Lebanon,”</em> which, by the way, is a serious point in Afghanistan. </p><p> <em>“Russia came here with tanks, while the US came to Afghanistan with television and cash. It takes a long time for them, but eventually they get what they want. They set up a base here. People are against them and want them to leave, to which Americans respond, “OK, we are leaving.” But there are always those who ask them to stay,”</em> Nadyr says, meaning both candidates are willing to sign the agreement on further presence of the US troops. </p><p> <em>“They started the mess in Ukraine while being here and now make troubles in Dagestan. They aim at stirring up troubles in order to isolate Russia from the rest of the world. The Afghan people understand the essence of the US policy quite well now. But Americans also target the young people. There are some who think that since Americans brought television and the internet, they should stay,”</em> Ysa says, apparently not minding. He is among these young people. </p><p> <em>“Nothing happens the way we want,”</em> Ysa admits. And that’s true – nobody has asked the Afghan people in the last 35 years what they really want. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155272-ukraine-slovakia-reverse-gas/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukraine strikes 3.2 bcm reverse gas flow deal with Slovakia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155272-ukraine-slovakia-reverse-gas/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e8/80/00/ukraine_slovakia_reverse_gas_flow.jpg" title="Workers stand near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters/Gleb Garanich)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 13:18:44 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e8/80/00/ukraine_slovakia_reverse_gas_flow.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Energy-pinched Ukraine has reached a deal to start reverse gas flows from Central European neighbors via an unused pipeline to Slovakia.

The gas is being supplied under a 2012 contract where RWE can deliver up to 10 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine per year. </p><p> Between these two deals alone, Ukraine has upped its supply from Europe ten-fold. Last year Ukraine imported around 2 billion cubic meters of gas from EU member states. </p><p> Ukraine imports nearly 50 percent of its natural gas from Russia, a country it now finds itself at diplomatic ends with, as it moves towards possible EU integration. In 2013, the country bought 27.7 billion meters, from Gazprom, Russia’s largest state-owned natural gas producer. </p><p> The deal is a short-term solution for Ukraine, which can no longer afford Russian gas after Moscow cancelled all gas discounts for Kiev, as it waits for Ukraine to repay an overdue gas bill of $2.2 billion. </p><p> Ukraine’s Energy Ministry was hoping to unlock more gas imports from its European neighbors, but Slovakian authorities must be careful not avoid any <a href="http://rt.com/business/gas-miller-ukraine-debt-553/" target="_blank">legal issues</a> with Gazprom. </p><p> Currently Ukraine needs to pay <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-gas-price-ukraine-113/" target="_blank">$485 per thousand cubic meters</a> for Russian gas, which compares to $268.5 agreed between Russia and Ukraine in December. </p><p> Ukraine currently has a “take-and-pay” contract with Gazprom which it is required to buy 41.6 billion cubic meters of gas in order to receive discount prices. In 2013, Ukraine only bough 12.9 billion cubic meters of gas, which prompted Gazprom last week to send Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state oil and gas company, a bill for $11.4 billion. </p><p> Ukraine presidential candidate Pyotr Poroshenko has said that by 2015, Ukraine will stop buying Russian gas. More neighbors may be tapped to start supplying gas to Ukraine, perhaps Poland or Hungary. </p><h2> Time to diversify? </h2><p> In the wake of the <a href="http://rt.com/news/eastern-ukraine-army-operation-680/" target="_blank">Ukraine crisis</a>, many of Gazprom's European customers have been second-guessing Russian gas, and have <a href="http://rt.com/business/eu-us-energy-summit-929/">renewed</a> conversations of lessening dependence from their powerful neighbor. </p><p> Many countries in Eastern Europe believe the continent can achieve energy security and at the same time retain relations with Russia. Croatian President Ivo Josipovic doesn't see the energy as a zero sum game. </p><p> <em>"Diversifying supplies does not mean that the EU’s current gas, oil and coal suppliers, primarily Russia and Norway, will not continue to be important energy partners of the EU. What will change is that EU member countries will have more conceivable alternatives in the interest of energy security,"</em> Josipovic <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/04/28/guest-post-eu-must-address-energy-needs-of-eastern-members/?catid=491&amp;SID=google"> wrote</a> in an FT opinion piece on Monday. </p><p> Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk has been a main proponent of diversifying Europe's imports as well as <a href="http://rt.com/business/poland-shale-taxes-russia-346/">developing shale</a>, but their is still discord among much of Europe. In terms of developing shale, many states in Europe have banned the practice, while others, like Croatia, are taking a more cautious approach, than say, Poland or the <a href="http://rt.com/news/uk-government-fracking-industry-829/" target="_blank">UK</a>. </p><p> Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic import 100 percent of their natural gas from Russia and logically want to diversify their import options. Other countries like Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia, and Italy are very keen to continue doing business with Russia, especially on Gazprom's 'South Stream' project, which by 2018 will supply 64 billion cubic meters of natural gas to European markets. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/155344-russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor/</guid><title><![CDATA[Prosecutor General seeks tougher punishment for corruption]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/155344-russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/00/00/russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor.jpg" title="Yury Chaika, Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation (RIA Novosti/Vladimir Astapkovich)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:55:17 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ed/00/00/russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Top Russian Prosecutor has proposed a bill making a prison sentence the only punishment for anyone convicted of corruption.

Russian law enforcers opposed the move from the moment it was first suggested and prosecutors warned that the changes could simply lead to increases in bribes as criminals would seek compensation for future punishment. </p><p> However, in Autumn 2013 President Putin criticized the changes in his <a href="http://rt.com/politics/putin-corruption-tolerance-zero-965/" target="_blank">speech</a> before the Anti-Corruption Council – a special body of top law enforcers and state officials. </p><p> “<em>The practice shows us that the liberalization is not working the way it should</em>,” Putin said. According to the president, 692 people were convicted for taking bribes in the first half of 2013 and only 8 percent of them were sentenced to prison time, while the majority got away with fines that the criminals managed not to pay by using various loopholes. </p><p> Putin then told the council members that he expected them to submit particular suggestions on fighting corruption, suggesting to start with the area of communal services, consumer market and various government tenders. </p><p> Putin also urged the officials to make anti-graft standards universally accepted. He added that society and business had the right to demand the state strictly observed all anti-corruption laws, but should not act as indifferent observers. Moreover, quite often citizens were pushing civil servants towards violations in pursuit of their own business interests. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155348-us-administration-failure-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA['Obama and Kerry fail to show leadership qualities required to settle Ukrainian issue']]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155348-us-administration-failure-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/40/00/us-administration-failure-ukraine.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:33:26 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/40/00/us-administration-failure-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The US had set their eyes on the idea to make Ukraine the 29th EU state or perhaps even the 52nd US state, though it doesn’t have any clear scenario and simply continues "blamestorming" Russia, global financial markets expert Patrick Young told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/40/00/us-administration-failure-ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>President Obama says Russia's done nothing to meet its Geneva pledges. However, it’s likely to be more applicable to the US itself. Why is Washington acting like this?</em> </p><p> <strong>Patrick Young:</strong> I think the State Department is probably under great stress at the moment. Of course we’ve seen President Obama, in the course of the last three or four days, doing shuttle diplomacy through South-East Asia. This was supposed to be an incredible ceremonial tour where he would sign multiple free trade agreements, including with Japan. Instead he ended up to play football with robots in Tokyo instead. Why? Because ultimately his trade agenda is failing as it goes along. Therefore, given the pureness of the overall quality of the negotiation of the US, it’s hardly surprising that they are trying to do anything to take away the news. And therefore, we see Mr. Obama once again being a puppet ministered by the neo-cons that are still behind him, as an administration who simply see everything as being bad in Russia. It’s quite clear from what Mr. Lavrov has said, and has been saying, that he is trying everything to encourage people to disarm and therefore, active attempts to try to diffuse the Ukrainian situation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What is the American policy aimed at? Does the United States actually want the two sides in Ukraine to reach a deal?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> I think it’s very worrying because certainly the US seems to have had a remarkable transition in Ukraine. It seemed to be absolutely fine when you wanted to mount barricades in Maidan and they were the people who got the likes of John McCain to speak to them. Not only we’ve got this very fractured situation in Eastern Ukraine about which the Russians had previously warned us. Ultimately we have got a singular failure of diplomacy but particularly from the Western side at the moment. And of course what is happening, President Obama is rushing off to this mantra of claiming that he wants even greater sanctions. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What does the United States expect of Russia, then? It can't send in its military to disarm the pro-Russian protesters in Ukraine. It's asked them to disarm, what more can it do?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> Personally I’m confused because let’s put it another way. If Russia sent in troops to forcibly disarm the people who are holding the buildings, then America would claim they are invading. I really don’t know. The American picture is not clear. The Foreign Secretary Mr. Kerry perennially, as we know from his election campaign for president, has always worn a peppermint T-shirt and a full bag of coffee when he is at the diner. Ultimately it’s a huge problem in this environment at the moment. I don’t think America knows what it wants because ultimately America had set their eyes on the idea Ukraine is going to be something like the 29th state of the EU or perhaps even the 52nd state of the US. None of those were ever going to come to pass, the money is not there from the US and Europe to support whether it’s the rump Ukraine or whichever part of Ukraine it is. It’s confusing. America is not clear and simply <em>"blamestorming"</em> Russia is not going to help the situation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Neither Kiev nor the protesters seem to have stuck to the Geneva accord. Are they each waiting for the other side to act first?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> The problem we have here is a huge loss of faith on all parts. America clearly doesn’t trust Russia, at the same time there is a huge number of people on the ground in Ukraine who’ve been simply left behind. We are not talking about particularly the Eastern Ukrainians who have actually invaded these buildings, those occupying groups are one thing. But actually let’s face it: Ukraine is being run by a non-democratically appointed government that seems to have the blessing of the US. It’s not democratic, there are democratic elections supposedly taking place at the moment but as we can see, all the great powers are in there trying to shuffle things for their influence. It looks very 19th century in the way the things are going on at the moment. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why can’t the sides of the conflict reach any compromise? Or why the US doesn’t want to negotiate with Russia at least?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> Unfortunately, it is very difficult and this is a situation because after all as we know President Yanukovich, who was deeply flawed in his ability to govern, but was nonetheless the democratically elected president, ultimately had to flee the day after we had a group of Western politicians telling us that they had come to a wondrous solution in Kiev. Therefore, when there are challenges over the whole issue, it really requires leadership and statesmanship. The terrible problem is that Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry repeatedly fail to have those abilities that they demonstrate. Let’s put it another way. Today we are celebrating in Poland the canonization of Pope John Paul II, there is leader and he stood on the world stage at the time we had Mrs. Thatcher, Ronald Reagan – they may have been the absolute enemies of the old Soviet system but they were people who could do business with and did business with Mr. Gorbachev at the time. That’s the total change that we have in this situation, we have a series of political pygmies throughout the West, none of whom really realize that their word must be their bond. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/</guid><title><![CDATA[Obama rolls out new sanctions on Russia, Moscow says it won't hurt]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/40/00/obama-sanctions-putin-calculus.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama talks during a joint news conference at the Malacanang Palace in Manila, April 28, 2014.

(Reuters/Larry Downing)" /> <p> The individuals listed by the US Department of Treasury on Monday include Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, chair of the parliamentary commission on Foreign Affairs, Aleksey Pushkov, chief of presidential office, Vyacheslav Volodin, and Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft oil company. <br><br> The list of sanctioned companies, which Washington believes to be “linked to Putin’s inner circle,” includes several banks, construction and transport companies. <br><br> The Volga Group, an investment vehicle that manages assets on behalf of the businessman, Gennady Timchenko, and SMP Bank, whose main shareholders were affected by the previous set of US sanctions, are among those to face restrictive measures. <br><br> Oil and gas engineering company, Stroytransgaz, and one of Russia’s biggest rail transporters of oil, Transoil, are also among the companies affected by the sanctions. <br><br> The US Department of Commerce has introduced additional restrictions on 13 of those companies by imposing a license requirement with a presumption of denial for the export, re-export or other foreign transfer of US-originating items to the companies. <br><br> Later in the day, Washington announced a tightened policy to deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russia’s military capabilities. <br><br> But the US may move even further and impose sanctions against specific branches of the Russian economy if Moscow begins a military operation in Ukraine, Jay Carney, White House spokesman, said. </p><p> The announcement of a new round of US sanctions against Russia is “revolting” as they go against the way civilized states should communicate, Sergey Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, said. <br><em><br> “We will respond, although it is not our choice,”</em> Ryabkov is cited as saying by Itar-Tass news agency. <em>“But we can’t leave this situation without reaction, without practical reaction, without reaction by means of our own decisions. US behavior in the field is becoming provocative.”</em> <br><br> According to the deputy FM, the American decision stems from a <em>“distorted and groundless</em>” assumption on the state of affairs in Ukraine. </p><p> Obama said the US and its allies would keep broader sanctions <em>“in reserve”</em> in the event of further escalation on the ground in Ukraine. He admitted that he was uncertain whether the latest round of measures would be effective. </p><p> <em>“The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally; the goal is to change his calculus, to encourage him to walk the walk, not just talk the talk</em>" on diplomacy to resolve the crisis, Obama said in Manila during a trip to Asia. </p><p> <a class="video-link-autoprocess" href="/files/news/25/eb/40/00/oliver_1600_480p.mp4">Video: /files/news/25/eb/40/00/oliver_1600_480p.mp4</a> </p><p> As the US pushes for more sanctions against Russia, EU members have preliminary agreed to also impose asset freezes and visa bans on 15 more people. The names of those to be added to the list will not be made public until they are published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, Reuters reported citing an unnamed diplomat source. However, Many Europeans opposed anti-Russian sanctions, which would target the economy as opposed to individuals close to the Russian leadership, since economic sanctions would hurt European economies as well as that of Russia. The US, being economically tied with Russia to a much lesser degree than Europe, says it would not impose economic sanctions <a href="http://rt.com/news/155168-us-eu-sanctions-russia/" target="_blank">unilaterally</a>. </p><p> <em>“I would be very surprised if all European countries found a common position on economic sanctions,”</em> Thierry Mariani, a member of the French National Assembly, told RT. <em>“When one country says ‘we don’t speak about finance’… and some other country says ‘we don’t speak about energy,’ then we don’t speak about anything. That’s why we arrive unfortunately [at] personal sanctions, which are completely nonsense.”</em> </p><p> Canada has also imposed sanctions on two Russian banks and nine individuals, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement announcing the measures on Monday. Harper's office did not immediately provide names. </p><p> The Russian leadership has thus far brushed off the threat of sanctions as ineffectual, arguing they might in fact buoy the Russian economy in the long term. </p><p> <em>“Overreliance can lead to a loss of sovereignty,”</em> Russian President <a href="http://rt.com/business/154576-sanctions-not-effective-putin/" target="_blank">Vladimir Putin said</a> at a media forum in St Petersburg on Thursday. </p><p> Western-led sanctions have several advantages for Russia, Putin said. </p><p> Putin said the threat of real economic sanctions is already bolstering domestic businesses, bringing more offshore funds back to Russia, and giving policymakers the push they need to establish a domestic payment system. </p><p> His comments <a href="http://rt.com/business/154012-sanctions-russia-stronger-medvedev/" target="_blank">echo sentiments</a> made by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev last week, who similarly argued that further sanctions would only make Russia stronger. </p><p> <em>“Thanks to Western sanctions, Russia has been given the incentive to reduce its dependence on outside and instead regional economies are being more self-sufficient,"</em> Medvedev said April 22. </p><p> Medvedev said any restrictions on Russian goods to the EU or US would serve to redirect Russian exports to Asian markets, which are more robust. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155352-putin-ukraine-defense-industry/</guid><title><![CDATA[End of defense imports to Russia would be catastrophe for Ukraine – Putin]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155352-putin-ukraine-defense-industry/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/80/00/putin-ukraine-defense-industry.jpg" title="Russian President Vladimir Putin (RIA Novosti/Alexei Druzhinin)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:56:29 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ed/80/00/putin-ukraine-defense-industry.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The end of defense industry cooperation between Kiev and Moscow due to the political crisis in Ukraine would lead the latter to a catastrophe, while Russia would be able to replace what it imports, President Putin has said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/80/00/putin-ukraine-defense-industry.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin (RIA Novosti/Alexei Druzhinin)" /> <p> <em>“Financially and technically Russia is able to conduct import substitution,”</em> Putin has said, adding that it won't require substantial funding. And this <em>“would not require a revision of the state defense order.”</em> </p><p> He estimated the whole process of import substitution for Russia would take between 1.5 and 2.5 years, depending on the type of the products. </p><p> <em>“But for the Ukrainian defense industry, the severing of ties with Russian partners is likely to lead to disaster,”</em> Putin said, speaking to the members of the Council of Lawmakers. <em>“Why? They don’t have any other markets. They just don’t exist. The only consumer is the Russian Armed Forces.”</em> </p><p> However, he expressed hope that <em>“rupture of these cooperation relations”</em> will not happen. </p><p> Still, Putin said he believes that such a halt to supplies is not a decision made <em>“directly by enterprises.”</em> </p><p> <em>"They [managers of these enterprises] understand perfectly in which situation Ukrainian government puts them. I’m sure, they would like to continue this cooperation,”</em> he said. </p><p> Earlier, Ukrainian First Vice-President Vitaly Yarema stated that the coup-appointed Ukrainian government had agreed to halt exports of weapons and military equipment to Russia. At the same time, he confirmed that deliveries of double-purpose (military and civil) products still continue. </p><p> Speaking of sanctions that the West is considering imposing on Russian industry sectors, and particularly the country’s military industrial complex, Putin stated that the measure, if taken, could be an attempt to prevent Russia from defense import substitution. </p><p> But, he said, <em>“This is an attempt with a bad means.”</em> </p><p> <em>“We will do that anyway,”</em> Putin emphasized. </p><p> Putin said that he has already ordered Russia’s government to examine the question of import substitution of the military-industrial complex’s products coming from Ukraine. </p><p> <em>“In any case, we are working on this now, I gave such an order to the government of the Russian Federation and they are actively working on it. [We are] studying all the issues related to import substitution,”</em> he said. </p><p> Russia will welcome specialists in the military-industrial complex from Ukraine, Putin said, vowing financial support to provide them with all necessities. </p><p> <em>“They will receive a worthy salary, and accommodation. [The regions] will receive all necessary means from the federal budget,"</em> Putin said. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155256-asian-economic-outlook-imf/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Japan and China threaten Asian economic growth - IMF]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155256-asian-economic-outlook-imf/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e7/80/00/asiat-economic-outlook-imf.jpg" title="Reuters/Toru Hanai"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:01:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e7/80/00/asiat-economic-outlook-imf.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Asian growth will remain steady at 5.4 percent in 2014, however a steeper than expected slowdown in China and a failure in Japan’s "Abenomics" program could derail the region’s economic progress, says the IMF.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e7/80/00/asiat-economic-outlook-imf.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Toru Hanai" /> <p> Asia also faces risks from outside the region, including improving growth in the US, which could raise global interest rates the new IMF <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2014/apd/eng/areo0414.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> said. </p><p> "<em>Bouts of capital flow and asset price volatility are likely along the way, with exchange rates, equity prices, and government bond yields affected by changes in global risk aversion and capital flows,</em>" the IMF concludes. </p><p> The IMF raised its growth forecast for Asia this year due to a pickup in external demand alongside a recovery in advanced economies. Growth is also expected to improve slightly to 5.5 percent in 2015. Last year, the region grew 5.2 percent. </p><p> However, the IMF predicts China will slowly decelerate to growth of 7.5 percent this year and 7.3 percent in 2015,to a "<em>more sustainable path</em>". </p><p> 2014 has been a <a href="http://rt.com/business/world-bank-china-growth-873/" target="_blank">bumpy start</a> for China, due to financial sector vulnerabilities, and the temporary cost of reforms, along with the transition toward a more sustainable growth path would have significant adverse regional spillover. </p><p> Domestic and global political tensions could also create trade disruptions and weaken investment and growth across the region. In some frontier economies, high credit growth has led to rising external and domestic vulnerabilities. </p><p> The IMF expects Japan's growth to decrease to 1 percent in 2015 from 1.4 percent this year, due to a reduction in the stimulus effects from monetary and fiscal easing. Another barrier towards growth will be a need to reduce debt, the outlook said. </p><p> Abenomics is Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s plan to stoke the economy and spur growth after decades of decline, with a commitment to keep the yen weak. </p><p> Meanwhile, the IMF says a pickup in external demand coupled with a recovery in advanced economies and resilient domestic demand should contribute to growth across most of the region. </p><p> "<em>The advanced economies are turning a corner and many Asian economies which depend on exports as a main growth engine are in a good position to capitalize on the recovery.

" /> <p> Somehow the bullets and missiles that could still be used end up in a pile slated for destruction, and because a single weapons arsenal database has still not been worked out, an estimated $1.2 billion pile of ammo will go down the drain. So says a Government Accountability Office report obtained by USA Today. </p><p> The development of the database has been in the works for years, but different services have their own information systems, which to this day can’t share that information directly. The only department that has adopted a new system by the Pentagon is the Army. The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps are all using outdated ones. </p><p> Democrat Senator and Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tom Carper told USA Today that <em>“there is a huge opportunity to save millions, if not billions of dollars if the [Pentagon] can make some common-sense improvements to how it manages ammunition.”</em> </p><p> The senator added that <em>“despite years of effort, the Army, Navy and Air Force still don't have an efficient process for doing something as basic as sharing excess bullets. This Government Accountability Office (GAO) report clearly shows that our military's antiquated systems lead to millions of dollars in wasteful ammunition purchases.”</em> </p><p> The Pentagon has agreed that a need to automate the inventory reporting system should take center stage in future budgets. Although the study only covers peace-time arsenal accounting, one anonymous top military officer noted in an interview with USA Today that there were frequent shortages of 9mm handgun and .50-caliber machine gun ammo in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p><p> Among other things, the GAO report has found that even after annual meetings between the various military services, which attempt to redistribute the unused stockpile by sharing surplus data, ammunition that didn’t get discussed automatically gets the axe and is added to the pile for destruction. By comparison to the $1 billion wasted, the $70 million saved appears negligible. </p><p> To put things into perspective, the Army’s missile stockpile alone comprises $14 billion of the Department of Defense’s total of $70 billion in ammo under management. </p><p> A number of other shortfalls, such as that the Army only last year began to report on its unused missiles, adds greatly to the billion-dollar waste. The Army’s choice not to report on a bulk of its surplus ammunition results in other services buying fresh. Its reporting fails to mention ammo left over and stored from previous years. As authors point out, the study was on the eve of being released when other potential sources of bad information emerged. So those losses will not have been included. </p><p> Furthermore, tedious bureaucratic measures to do with sharing procedures result in computer orders for ammo made to the Army having to be entered into the system manually, raising the risk of clerical error. </p><p> In sum, the report appears to place much of the blame on the Army brushing everyone away with claims that they don’t have enough surplus ammo left over for redistribution annually. But without the Army’s active participation in this, <em>“other services [spend] additional funds to procure missiles that are already unused and usable in the Army’s stockpile.”</em> </p><p> The Army, following Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s and the GAO’s recommendations, has promised to do better and has already begun increasingly to share surplus ammo information with other services starting March. Previously, the service had not been contributing to the annual report at all. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155308-constitution-police-cellphones-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[Warrantless cellphone searches get hearing in Supreme Court]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155308-constitution-police-cellphones-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.jpg" title="Reuters/Gary Cameron"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:01:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Supreme Court will hear two cases – one involving a suspected drug dealer, the other a gang member – to determine the legality of police searching cellphones without a warrant at the time of an arrest.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Gary Cameron" /> <p> The landmark cases pit the Obama administration, still reeling from whistleblower Edward Snowden’s NSA revelations, against civil rights advocates who say police are conducting illegal search and seizures. <br><br> In the digital age, when about 90 percent of US citizens own cellphones and 58 percent have a smart phone, a legal battle is raging behind the scenes as to whether cellphones should be protected under the Fourth Amendment, which forbids <em>“unreasonable searches and seizures.”</em> Or should the technology become fair game for the police following an arrest? <br><br> The question will be considered in the case of David Leon Riley (<em>Riley v California</em> 13-1312), who was pulled over in San Diego in 2009 for driving with an expired license. After discovering guns in his car, the police found evidence on Riley’s Samsung smart phone that got him convicted on attempted murder charges. <br><br> The state of California rejected efforts by Riley’s attorney to toss out the use of the digital evidence. <br><br> In the other case (<em>United States v Wurie</em>, 13-212), Brima Wurie was arrested in Massachusetts for dealing drugs. Following a search of his cellphone’s call log, investigators found an address, where they discovered more illegal substances and a gun. Unlike the case of David Riley, Wurie had his sentence overturned when the court rejected the evidence retrieved from his phone. <br><br> Under the Fourth Amendment, police require a warrant based on <em>"probable cause"</em> before they can conduct a search. <br><br> In the past, the courts have granted police the authority to search the possessions of arrested individuals for two reasons: determining the individual is not carrying a weapon and preventing the destruction of evidence, like narcotics. <br><br> The question of cell phones, they argue, does not fit into either category. <br><br> Jeffrey Fisher, the lawyer for Riley, pointed to FBI statistics showing some 12 million Americans were arrested in 2012 alone, mostly over “minor crimes” like <em>"jaywalking, littering or riding a bicycle the wrong direction on a residential street,"</em> he said in his court filing. <br><br> It would be wrong, Fisher believes, that police would have the authority to search a person’s cellphone without first getting a court order to provide a warrant. </p><p> </p><p> <em>"The digital contents of a smart phone are categorically incapable of threatening officer safety. And once police have seized and secured a smart phone, there is no risk that the arrestee might destroy or alter its digital contents,"</em> Fisher continued. <br><br><em>"Such files hold exponentially greater amounts and types of sensitive personal information than any physical item."</em> <br><br> Civil rights watchdogs agree with that position. <br><br><em>"Cellphones and other portable electronic devices are, in effect, our new homes,"</em> the American Civil Liberties Union said in a court filing urging the Supreme Court to uphold the letter of the Fourth Amendment. <br><br> The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF argued on behalf of privacy, reminding that smart phones hold huge amounts of personal data. <br><br><em>"The breadth of that information would likely reveal an individual's medical history, religious beliefs, political affiliations, network of friends, colleagues, intimate associates, and acquaintances,"</em> as stated in a friend-of-the-court letter filed by EFF and others. <br><br> However, the Obama administration - and despite the criticism it received in the wake of the Snowden NSA leaks, which detailed a vast global surveillance system being used against friends and enemies alike - is in favor of granting police access to private data without a warrant. <br><br><em>"It is now common for drug deals to be arranged by cell phones, for violent street gangs to communicate through text messages, and for child abuse to be recorded on camera phones,"</em> the Justice Department stated in its court filings. <em>"In today's world, cell phones are particularly likely to contain evidence of unlawful activity and to help law-enforcement officers identify suspects they have apprehended."</em> <br><br> According to this argument, cellphones are no different from anything other possession a person may be carrying when arrested. <br><br><em>"Cellphones are now critical tools in the commission of crimes,"</em> said Donald Verrilli Jr., the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, AP reported. <br><br> Officials, however, are urging caution in coming to any quick conclusions in the case because the <em>“technology is changing rapidly,”</em> Attorney General of California Kamala Harris said in her court filing. <br><br> The court is expected to arrive at its conclusion in the cases by late June. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155320-kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Mayor of Kharkov, Ukraine shot in back, hospitalized - press service]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155320-kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/80/00/kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine.jpg" title="Kharkov Mayor Gennady Kernes (RIA Novosti/Chekachkov Igor)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:32:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/eb/80/00/kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov, Gennady Kernes, has been shot in the back, the city council’s press service reports.

His lung is pierced and his liver pierced all the way through.”</em> </p><p> The mayor was taken to the local hospital at about 11:30 am (8:30 GMT) local time. </p><p> Following an operation that lasted two hours, Valery Boyko, the surgeon who was treating Kernes, called his condition serious as his diaphragm had been injured. He also said that his interior organs have been damaged and he will remain in serious condition for at least several days. </p><p> Boyko said that the doctors had stopped the bleeding, but that Kernes is currently unconscious. </p><p> <em>“The operation was performed successfully. Now we rely on God and wish strength to Gennady Kernes,”</em> he added. </p><p> Meanwhile, Sidorenko, of mayor’s press service, declined to comment about who was behind the shooting. He only told RT that Kernes <em>“has been recently receiving a lot of threats from various people.”</em> </p><p> A shell <em>“allegedly from sniper rifle”</em> was found at the site where the mayor was shot, Irina Kushchenko, from the public relations department of the city’s Executive Committee. </p><p> Party of Regions presidential candidate Mikhail Dobkin, a close friend of Kernes, said the gunman used live fire. According to Dobkin, there was a 7.62 mm shell from a Dragunov sniper rifle. </p><p> An unexploded grenade has also been found at the scene where the mayor was shot, Mikhail Dobkin has told local media. <br></p><p> <em>“At the spot where he fell, a grenade without a pin was found,”</em> he said, as cited by ITAR-TASS news agency. <em>“By a lucky chance, it did not explode.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> A mayor of Kharkov since March 2010, Kernes had been a strong supporter of President Viktor Yanukovich right till his ouster in February. Since then he supported the new Ukrainian authorities and kept his position. </p><p> The shooting comes a day after ultranationalists clashed with anti-government protesters in the city, leaving 14 people injured. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/puG2Wn6wJA4" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> Meanwhile, Ukrainian presidential candidate Oleg Tsarev condemned the attack on the Kharkov mayor. He said that despite his and Kernes’ political rivalry, the attack outraged him. </p><p> <em>“Shooting at the politicians is wrong. Once again it shows that it is impossible to hold presidential elections until we reach consensus and civil peace,”</em> he added. </p><p> Kharkov mayor and Party of Regions member Gennady Kernes was born June 27, 1959, in Kharkov, then in the Ukrainian SSR. He is a lawyer and manager by profession. </p><p> A miner in the late 70s, Kernes became engaged in politics in 1998, when he ran for the Kharkov City Council. </p><p> In 2004, Kernes was an enthusiastic supporter of the Orange Revolution. Political alliances secured him the mayor’s post on October 31, 2010, after Mikhail Dobkin had become head of the regional state administration. The results, which were overwhelmingly in his favor again, were controversial and came under suspicion from critics. During his tenure as mayor, he has become well known among locals for his far-reaching city reforms and his contributions to development and charitable causes. </p><p> However, Kernes’s past is also entangled with Ukraine’s underworld – among other things, he was allegedly the boss of his own criminal organization, which gained notoriety in the region. He was also convicted of theft and fraud. </p><p> Since the February 2014 coup in Ukraine, he has been accused of fomenting separatism. In January, he gave himself a controversial 25 percent pay rise. </p><p> Kernes was awarded many political honors in his time. He is a father of three children. His hobbies, among other things, include actively promoting and leading a healthy lifestyle. </p><p> Thousands of anti-government demonstrations have swept eastern Ukraine since March, with administration buildings being seized in several cities, including Kharkov, the largest city. </p><p> At the beginning of March some 111 people were injured in clashes between anti-government protesters and radical nationalists in the city after the radical groups then seized the administration building. Commenting on the incident, Mayor Kernes said they were ultra nationalist elements <em>“who hid their faces behind masks and had weapons, including automatic ones,”</em> adding that <em>“it turned out that these men came from western Ukraine – from Lvov, Ivano-Frankovsk.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155300-gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Russia not obliged to finance Ukraine-EU integration’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155300-gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/40/00/gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu.jpg" title="A worker stands near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:19:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/40/00/gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Since the moment Ukraine chose to become an independent state, it has had to accept that it can’t develop as a country at the cost of Russian taxpayers, Anna Van Densky, political commentator from the EU Reporter Magazine, told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/40/00/gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A worker stands near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters)" /> <p> Speaking about Russian gas, Van Densky said that Europe needs it badly for its development, while this commodity is taken hostage because of the political contradictions and ambitions over Ukrainian crisis. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> H<em>as the gas supply to Europe ever been as threatened as it is now?</em> </p><p> <strong>Anna Van Densky:</strong> It has always been a problem like that because after the collapse of the Soviet Union it was very difficult for the Ukrainian leadership to come to the terms that independence has its own price and if Ukraine is an independent state. They have to pay for gas as for any other commodity. Now of course it’s not the first so-called gas war because, unfortunately, gas transit was used on many occasions as an instrument of political pressure. </p><p> That what we see now, because now the supplies to Europe are also threatened, that’s why the South Stream corridor is so crucial to stabilize gas supplies to Europeans, because we had the situation with crisis in 2006, 2009. It’s a system that should be really reconstructed, rebuilt in another way, and that’s why it’s ideal for Ukrainians themselves also to have different view on the energy so that they could also open a broad gate to green energy, for example, alternative energy, wind energy, etc. So this dependency on transit of Russian gas is also unhealthy for the Ukrainian state, for Ukrainians, because unfortunately there were many parasites around this easy money. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Is South Stream pipeline really necessary? Surely it would be cheaper to work out a proper, long term deal with Ukraine? What do you think?</em> </p><p> <strong>AD:</strong> There are a lot of details that are very ambivalent. First of all, in any supplies it’s much better to have multiple ways than one way, so it’s not only for political reasons. There can be other reasons like a catastrophe. The problem of supply isn’t dependent on Ukrainians as such. [The] more routes, [the] more secure it is. That’s why you talk all the time about diversifying the ways of gas. South Stream is an ideal way because it goes from Russia through Black Sea and it comes to Bulgaria, it comes directly to the EU. So it’s one of the ways, it’s not about cutting gas, Russian gas, from [going] through Ukraine, it’s just diminishing this route and giving other alternative routes and opportunity. It’s also very fashionable because it will open real opportunities for the other alternative to Ukrainians, like green energy, for example. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> U<em>kraine still wants heavily discounted gas prices. Is that a fair request?</em> </p><p> <strong>AD:</strong> It’s not a fair request, no. It comes from the Soviet era, because once upon a time Soviet Union was basically one state. Asking for this price is absolutely ridiculous in the situation of being an independent state and buying a commodity. It’s a confusion and this confusion caused a lot of political problems afterwards as well, because the moment Ukraine or Ukrainian people chose to become an independent state, they had to accept that they can’t develop their country on cost of Russian taxpayers, because they are the citizens of other countries. That’s the way it goes. </p><p> So it’s a lot of political confusion now as well, because if Europeans would like to help Ukrainians they have to sit together with Russians at the negotiation table and find out the way to help them to pay their bills, because it would be very naïve to expect that Russian taxpayers are obliged to finance Ukrainian integration into the EU. </p><p> So it’s not the way the things work. Unfortunately, all the revolutions are very anti-democratic because now the decisions are in the hands of a very small group of people, they were not elected democratically. I personally hope that after the real democratic elections there will be new leaders who will accept a fair and modern-style relationship with Russia. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Isn't Russia's reputation as a reliable energy supplier is now a hostage to Kiev's political whims? Is there any solution?</em> </p><p> <strong>AD:</strong> The South Stream is an ideal solution basically because it goes from Russia through the Black Sea and to Europe. It will help Europe because European needs gas badly, for example, Italy wants to develop southern Italy, and it would be a great opportunity for the economies of the south to get Russian gas. Let’s not forget that gas remains the most ecological among all types of energy. So it’s good for Europe, it’s good for [the] economy and it’s very sad that such a commodity is taken hostage because of these political contradictions and ambitions. </p><p> It’s especially important to have South Stream corridor as a solution to diversify the ways of gas to Europe. The latest Ukrainian Maidan revolution is not the first one, there was also the Orange Revolution and the hope was flying high, but it didn’t deliver it and it ended in a second revolution, Maidan. When the situation will be stabilizing in Ukraine nobody really knows. We hope it will be stabilized soon. Anyway, I think that European and Russians, the taxpayers from both sides can’t be taken hostage of this political instability in Ukraine, so the South Stream and Nord Stream, maybe other pipeline like Yamal, will help to create real strategic partnership and well-being of the people. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/155292-russia-veterans-ombudsman-law/</guid><title><![CDATA[Leftist MP suggests establishing veterans’ ombudsman post]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/155292-russia-veterans-ombudsman-law/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e9/c0/00/russia-veterans-ombudsman-law.jpg" title="RIA Novosti/Evgeny Biyatov"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:16:05 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e9/c0/00/russia-veterans-ombudsman-law.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A Russian lawmaker holds that the country needs an official who would protect the veterans’ rights and help them cope with the rapidly changing laws and shifts in national economy.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e9/c0/00/russia-veterans-ombudsman-law.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="RIA Novosti/Evgeny Biyatov" /> <p> Oleg Mikheyev of the center-left Fair Russia party has addressed the government and the Public Chamber with a request to institute the post of plenipotentiary for veterans’ issues, or the veterans’ ombudsman, the RIA Novosti reported on Monday. Mikheyev wrote in the letter that he was ready to prepare and draft the bill himself if the initiative meets no objections. </p><p> “<em>Introducing this post is necessary due to the need to maximally protect the veterans’ rights in Russia, especially veterans of the Great Patriotic War [WWII] and other wars, the need to help them cope with the hardships of the transitional period economy including the constant changes in the legislation</em>,” the letter reads. </p><p> A special ombudsman could also speed up the solution of many veterans’ problems that are currently hampered by bureaucracy, the MP noted. </p><p> Mikheyev added that the legislative move would be timely as the country readies for the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in 2015. </p><p> The dedicated federal law on lists five categories of veterans, including a separate one for the veterans of the Great Patriotic War.

It managed to win enough votes in 2012 election to bring its candidate Morsi to power. </p><p> His government however failed to address acute economic and security problems that Egypt was facing, with protests continuing. A year after Morsi took the presidential oath, the Egyptian military staged a coup d'état and deposed him. The Muslim Brotherhood was subsequently outlawed again. </p><p> Former Egyptian army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is seeking presidency now in upcoming May election. Morsi supporters and members of Islamist political parties close to the Muslim Brotherhood are calling on a boycott of the poll. </p><p> Sisi, a strongman widely seen as the de facto ruler of Egypt, is trumpeted by his supporters as a figure that can stabilize the country in a time of crisis. There is little doubt that he will win the election, in which he has only one opponent: leftist Hamdeen Sabahi, who came third in the 2012 election. </p><h2> World’s Top 5 Executioners </h2><p> There were 778 recorded executions in 2013 worldwide, a jump of almost 15 percent on the previous year, with China, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United States topping the list, according to Amnesty International’s annual report for 2013. <br><br> 1. China: (it's a secret, but believed to be in the thousands) <br><br> The People’s Republic of China executed more people than any other country in 2013. Although the exact number is treated as classified state information, Amnesty International estimates that thousands are executed in the country of over 1 billion people every year, more than the rest of the world combined. <br><br> 2. Iran: 369 <br><br> Figures show an increase in executions of 18 percent on 2012. Amnesty said it had recorded "numerous cases" in which it appeared capital punishment had been used to counter protests by Iran's ethnic minorities. <br><br> 3. Iraq: 169 <br><br> Iraq’s executions figure is an increase of more than 30 percent compared to the previous year – the highest since 2003. Most death sentences in recent years are thought to have resulted from convictions under an anti-terror bill that covers acts such as <em>"provoking, planning, financing, committing or supporting others to commit terrorism."</em> <br><br> 4. Saudi Arabia: 79 <br><br> Strict observance of Sharia law has seen Saudi Arabia carry out 79 executions in central Riyadh, instead of privately executing criminals in prisons. It is one of the last five countries that still performs public executions, the other four being Iran, Syria, North Korea and Yemen. <br><br> 5. United States: 39 <br><br> The only country in the Americas that carried out executions last year. Of the total US figure, the state of Texas accounted for more than 40 percent of all executions in the country. <br><br> In total, 22 countries enforced capital punishment last year, one more than in 2012. Four of those countries – Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria and Vietnam – resumed executions after a hiatus. <br><br> No executions were carried out in Europe, Russia and Central Asia.

(AFP Photo / Crown Copyright)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why this urgent need for Russian-speaking agents in British intelligence? <br></em> </p><p> <strong>Annie Machon:</strong> Well it is interesting timing, I think, because for the last 5 or 6 years British intelligence has said that one of the biggest threats is Russian espionage in London. But now I think we're looking into situation where obviously post Russia infringe in Syria, stopping an illegal rush to war by the West in Syria, post the Ukraine, post Crimea and also of course post Edward Snowden and giving him asylum last year – I think that is an indication that the West is ramping up its interventionism and its investigation into Russian activity in the West. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>You have said this all smacks of the Cold War. Are the latest tensions between Moscow and the West really that bad?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> One would hope not. After the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a huge rapprochement between the West and the East, and I remember the former head of MI5 Dame Stella Rimington went across and worked with and spoke with her counterpart in Russia in the early 1990s to share information, to share working methodologies because the end of the war had occurred. </p><p> So it's rather worrying that the UK is now ramping-up their perceived risk around what they are doing with the Russian espionage aspect. But it is a shame, because I think Europe should be working together, Europe should not be dividing itself in the way they are doing at the dictate of the US. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The job ad on MI5's website says, “Your work will enable us to take a well-informed view of potential threats to national security, including terrorism and espionage.” Does this mean the UK thinks such threats could come from Russia?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> Well that is a very good question, because the job of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, the three primary intelligence agencies in the UK is to defend national security and the economic well-being of the state. </p><p> Now, national security has never been legally defined under the UK law. So we have a situation where it can be abused, used, reinterpreted whatever the government, or the intelligence agencies or the British establishment want to choose to say is national security. </p><p> I would suggest that what the British need to do is take a step back and say: “What is our national security? What is the threat to it? Is it the integrity of our nation such as we faced in WWII with the potential Nazi invasion? And if that is the case, how do we best protect it, how do we best police it?” </p><p> And of course in Britain, we have a very British mess, where we have a 100 year cycle of British intelligence agencies evolving and taking on the work, and just been giving jobs for the boys. </p><p> So I think for Britain, it would be good if they can step back and say what is the threat, and how do we best protect ourselves and how then we can structure our intelligence response, rather than just say: “This week we are a bit worried about this, we are a bit worried about this threat this year.” It is just a reaction rather than a pro-active and creative response to the threat to our nation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>For this job, MI5 will only consider Brits who have lived in the UK for the past 9 years, and whose parents are also British. Whom are these requirements supposed to rule out?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> One of the requirement to work for the British intelligence agencies is that you have to be British by nationality, and also I think you have to have grandparents, at least two that are British as well. So they are trying to ensure that people have a certain tie to the country, I suppose. But in this day and age of multiculturalism and everything, it becomes extremely difficult to adhere to that. </p><p> And it is interesting as well looking back over the last century that people who have been deemed to be traitors by the UK, who have gone over to what used to be Soviet side, who were allowed to leave the country and not get prosecuted under the espionage act of the early 20th century, tended to be the establishment. So there seems to be one rule for the generals and one rule for the infantry. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Is it just a coincidence that the need for experts on Russia comes at a time when Europe and the US are blaming Moscow for the current unrest in Ukraine?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> Well I think it is a bit rich for the West to say Russia is trying ferment the resistance within eastern Ukraine, when it appears that the West and EU have been trying to ferment resistance in western Ukraine before the original revolution that deposed the president. </p><p> I also find it interesting that the US president is trying to lecture Russia and say that “we have to go by the democratic rules” and things like that. That is precisely what has happened in Crimea. That is precisely what has not happened in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, so these sort of double standards are very troubling. </p><p> Either we adhere to international law, democracy and the rules around this. And I think this was what was done in Crimea. That is I want to see done in most of the Middle East and North Africa and Central Asia, or we don't. And for America to lecture one way and do just the other thing on the other side is not acceptable. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155240-tornado-damage-injuries-states/</guid><title><![CDATA[Casualties, massive damage as multiple tornadoes rip through US]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155240-tornado-damage-injuries-states/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e6/80/00/tornado.jpg" title="A low-level thunderstorm supercell passes over the area of Hampton, Arkansas (Reuters / Gene Blevins)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:40:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e6/80/00/tornado.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A powerful tornado storm system has ripped through several US states, killing one person in Oklahoma and at least 16 others in central Arkansas while causing major damage in the Great Plains, Midwest and Southern states.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e6/80/00/tornado.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A low-level thunderstorm supercell passes over the area of Hampton, Arkansas (Reuters / Gene Blevins)" /> <p> A tornado killed one person in Quapaw, a small residence in Oklahoma, on the border of Kansas and Missouri, authorities announced, saying the storm struck the town around 5:30pm local time. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> My hometown sustained a direct <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tornado&amp;src=hash">#tornado</a> hit.
