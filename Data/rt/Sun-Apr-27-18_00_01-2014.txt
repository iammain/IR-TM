(AFP Photo / Alexander Khudoteply)" /> <p> According to media reports, technical work is currently being done at the TV station to restart the transmission of Russian channels. Itar-Tass reports that some Russian TV channels have resumed work in Donetsk. </p><p> <em>“Their experts are now setting up equipment on our frequency to broadcast Russian TV channels,”</em> TV station CEO Oleg Dzholos told Ukraine’s Channel 5, Interfax-Ukraine reported. </p><p> </p><p> It has also been reported that pro-Russian protesters have begun talks with the TV center's executives to begin broadcasting the “Donetsk People's Republic” television channel. </p><p> <em>“There were many demands. First – switch off Ukrainian channels. I explained that we are Donetsk state TV and radio station and from our central control room, there is only our signal. There were experts and they understood me. The following demand was – not a demand, an ultimatum – to switch on, if I am not mistaken, Russia-24 TV channel,”</em> Dzholos said. </p><p> Protesters entered the TV station late Sunday afternoon, saying they were unsatisfied with the way the situation in the region was covered in local news and shows. Protesters demanded that Ukrainian channels be blocked. </p><p> They have taken down the Ukrainian flag from the TV station’s office and hoisted the flag of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. </p><p> </p><p> Protesters brought satellite antennas and other equipment and placed guards at the entrance to the television center, Itar-Tass reported. </p><p> Prior to taking control of the TV station, over 3,000 people gathered at Donetsk's central Lenin Square. Protesters started the rally with one minute's silence to commemorate Berkut Special Forces officers killed in clashes with radicals in Kiev's Independence Square, and activists killed by Right Sector radicals at a checkpoint in Slavyansk on Easter Sunday. </p><p> Russian TV channels have been blocked across Ukraine since the beginning of March, after the Ukrainian media watchdog claimed that shutting down Russian TV stations ensured the country’s <em>“national security and sovereignty.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> At least five major Russian channels, including Vesti, Russia-24, Channel One’s international broadcasts, RTR ‘Planeta’ and NTV World were immediately excluded from the list of options by providers throughout Ukraine. </p><p> The move was strongly condemned by the OSCE, which <a href="http://rt.com/news/russian-tv-suspended-ukraine-242/" target="_blank">called</a> the move <em>“repressive”</em> and <em>“a form of censorship.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Since then, the situation in Donetsk has deteriorated, with people demanding a referendum on the region’s autonomy from Kiev. Amid massive protests, when a number of government building were stormed and seized by anti-government activists, Kiev launched an “anti-terrorist” military operation targeting rallying civilians. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155176-mers-spread-saudi-arabia/</guid><title><![CDATA[MERS spreading: Saudi Arabia registers 10 more cases after Egypt discovers first patient]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155176-mers-spread-saudi-arabia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e2/80/00/000_nic6315648.jpg" title="Saudi women leave the emergency department at a hospital in the center of the Saudi capital Riyadh.

(AFP Photo / Fayez Nurildine)" /> <p> On Friday, Saudi Arabia announced that it had discovered 14 more cases, meaning the total number of infected patients then stood at 313. On Sunday the country confirmed a further 10 cases, bringing the number to 323. </p><p> <br> On Sunday, two more deaths were reported. Ninety-six of all MERS cases in the country have so far been fatal. The death rate for the illness stands at approximately 40 percent, and since the beginning of April cases have spiked with a 65 percent jump – 127 cases have been announced this month alone. <br><br> On Saturday, a 27-year-old Egyptian man was discovered to have contracted the disease. He had recently returned from Saudi Arabia and is currently being treated at a Cairo hospital, and is reportedly in a stable condition. <br><br> Shortly after the case was reported, a WHO spokesman stated that it was <em>“concerned”</em> about the rising numbers of people suffering from the disease. <br><br> Last Tuesday, it was reported that Greece’s first confirmed MERS patient was in critical condition, according to doctors. The same day, Saudi Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabiah was sacked shortly after visiting a hospital in Jeddah – the main gateway to the Islamic holy city of Mecca, in the country’s west – which he was visiting in order to alleviate heightened public fear over the virus. Many Saudis have been expressing heightened concern on social media. <br><br> MERS is a SARS-like disease which kills approximately one-third of people that become infected. There is currently no cure for it. <br><br> While the illness is compared to SARS, it is still in the process of being researched by experts. SARS exploded across Asia in 2003, infecting 8,273 people – nine percent of whom died. MERS is thought to be deadlier but more difficult to transmit. A February study suggested that camels are the major source of the disease, although previous studies said that it originated in bats. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155196-bahrain-police-killing-sentences/</guid><title><![CDATA[Bahrain hands down life sentences to 8 activists over policeman’s killing]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155196-bahrain-police-killing-sentences/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e3/c0/00/000_ts-nic6320929.jpg" title="A Bahraini protestor throws a tear gas canister back at riot police during clashes following a protest condemning the death of Ahmed Al-Mosajen and Ali Abbas, in the village of Al-Maqsha, west of Manama, on April 25, 2014.

(AFP Photo / Mohammed Al-Shaikh)" /> <p> The court handed down the sentences on Sunday, the Public Prosecutor's Office said. The men were found guilty of planting a homemade bomb close to where police usually set up checkpoints during protests. They were then accused of setting tires ablaze and blocking the road to lure security forces to the area. </p><p> One policeman was killed and four others were wounded in the ensuing blast, the prosecutor said. </p><p> The men were also found guilty of illegally taking part in anti-government protests in the northern village of Dair in August 2013. </p><p> The defendants, however, said they had made their confessions under torture. </p><p> In late March, 13 Bahrainis, some of them teenagers, were also jailed for life after being found guilty of attempting to kill policemen by attacking their vehicle and for taking part in an illegal protest in the Shiite village of Bilad al-Qadeem, just outside the capital, Manama. </p><p> Last week, 26 Bahrainis were sentenced to 10 years in jail each after being convicted of attacking a police station with petrol bombs and iron rods in Sitra in Bahrain's northeast in April 2012. A policeman was allegedly wounded in the incident. </p><p> Following sentencing on Sunday, Bahrain's main opposition group, al-Wefaq, said on its website that detainees were regularly subjected to torture and forced to make confessions and that the courts were ignoring human rights violations committed by the security forces, Reuters reports. </p><p> The Bahrain government says it has attempted to curb violence committed by security forces by dismissing officers who cross the line, and installing security cameras at police stations to monitor potential abuses. Activists say the measures have not helped. </p><p> Bahrain has been beset by massive street demonstrations since 2011. The opposition has demanded the establishment of a constitutional government in the Shia-majority state, which is ruled by a Sunni monarchy. On the eve of the three-year anniversary of the Arab Spring-inspired protests this past February, Lese-majeste became a crime punishable by up to 7 years in prison. </p><p> The US has been reluctant to criticize the small island country, which hosts its strategically vital Fifth Fleet. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155200-mi5-hiring-russian-experts/</guid><title><![CDATA[MI5’s hiring: British Secret Service is looking for intel experts on Russia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155200-mi5-hiring-russian-experts/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e4/00/00/rtrdluo.jpg" title="The MI5 headquarters in central London (Reuters / David Bebber)"/><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e4/00/00/rtrdluo.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK’s MI5 has decided to beef up its team with more experts on Russia amid the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine.

While the two sides agree on the necessity of de-escalation of the situation in Ukraine, there is still no agreement on approaches. </p><p> While the West is accusing Moscow of attempts to undermine sovereignty of the country, Russia is blaming the US and its European allies for fueling Maidan protests and supporting the coup-appointed Kiev government. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155192-us-philippines-security-pact/</guid><title><![CDATA[US denies 10yr Philippines security pact aimed against China]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155192-us-philippines-security-pact/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e3/80/00/000_hkg9614632.jpg" title="An armed US marine patrols next to seahawk helicopters on the deck of 7th Fleet command ship, USS Blue Ridge shortly after arriving at the international port in Manila on March 18, 2014, for a port visit.

We are doing this because we have a longstanding alliance partner [the Philippines]. They are interested in stepping up our military-to-military,”</em> Evan Medeiros, Obama’s top advisor on Asia, was cited as saying by AFP. <br><br> Filipino negotiators previously said that the deal wouldn’t allow the US to establish military bases in the country, or position nuclear weapons there. <br><br> But Medeiros still called the document <em>“the most significant agreement that we [the US] have concluded with the Philippines in decades.”</em> <br><br> The treaty runs for 10 years, which is shorter than Washington was originally asking for, but it can be prolonged if both sides see it necessary, two senior US officials told Reuters. <br><br> Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and US ambassador Philip Goldberg will put their signatures under the deal on April 28, just a few hours before President Barack Obama arrives to the Philippine capital, Manila, as part of his week-long Asian tour. <br><br> The United States is expected to gradually deploy combat ships, a squadron of F18s or F16s and maritime surveillance aircraft to the Philippines under the deal, a military source told Reuters. <br><br><em>“We are considering bases in Northern Luzon like Clark and Subic, and Fort Magsaysay, to accommodate the US forces. We will set aside space in those bases for their troops,"</em> the source said. <br><br> Clark and Subic were the two military bases maintained by the US military northwest of Manila until 1992, when the Philippines Senate voted to evict American troops from the country. <br><br> However, eight years later, the Senate approved an agreement allowing for temporary visits by US forces and joint military drills between the armies of the two states. <br><br> A total of 149 US Navy vessels visited the Philippines last year – almost a two-fold increase in comparison with 68 ships in 2012. <br> Manila has been seeking greater military and diplomatic support from the US in recent years, due to a territorial dispute with China. <br><br> Beijing, which claims most of the resources-rich South China Sea, has seized control of Scarborough Shoal in 2012 despite the island being situated far closer to the Filipino landmass than the Chinese. <br><br> The Chinese refused to participate in the UN tribunal on the validity of its territorial claims, which the Philippines imitated, saying that the move “seriously damaged” bilateral relations. <br><br> In March, Chinese vessels tried to block ships, which were bringing supplies to a Philippine military outpost on a tiny reef also claimed by Beijing. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155188-abbas-holocaust-heinous-crime/</guid><title><![CDATA[Palestinian president calls Holocaust 'most heinous crime' in modern history]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155188-abbas-holocaust-heinous-crime/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e3/40/00/000_nic6320965.jpg" title="Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

(AFP Photo / Abbas Momani)" /> <p> The message, delivered in Arabic and English, was timed to coincide with Israel's annual remembrance day for the mass murder of 6 million Jews during World War II. </p><p> The Holocaust, he said, represents the <em>"concept of ethnic discrimination and racism which the Palestinians strongly reject and act against."</em> </p><p> Abbas further called on the international community to stamp out racism and inequality <em>"to bring justice and equity to the oppressed people wherever they are."</em> </p><p> <em>"The Palestinian people are suffering from injustice, oppression and denied freedom and peace. We are the first to demand to lift the injustice and racism that befell on people subjected to such crimes,"</em> Abbas said. </p><p> Abbas also implored Israel to pursue a peace deal and allow Palestinians to have an independent state, just days after faltering peace talks collapsed. </p><p> The Palestinian leader had promised to issue such a statement at a meeting last week in Ramallah with Michael Schneier, former vice-president of the World Jewish Congress and head of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, Haaretz reports. </p><p> <em>"I heard what was said about Abbas' attitude toward the Holocaust, but was surprised to hear how clear he was on this issue when meeting me,"</em> Schneier told the daily. </p><h2> ‘It’s either us or them’ </h2><p> Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Abbas of forming an alliance with a <em>“Holocaust-denying terrorist organization that wants to kill more Jews.”</em> </p><p> <em>"Hamas denies the Holocaust while trying to create another Holocaust by destroying Israel,"</em> Netanyahu said in public remarks at the weekly meeting of his cabinet, the Jerusalem Post reports. <em>"It is with this Hamas that Abu Mazen chose to create an alliance last week…I hope he will escape this covenant and return to the path of real peace."</em> </p><p> A spokesman told Reuters Netanyahu's comments were not a direct response to Abbas's statement, but the Israeli leader was aware of what the Palestinian president had said. </p><p> On Wednesday, Hamas and Fatah leaders signed a reconciliation agreement following seven years of division. Under the deal, Abbas will form an interim unity government within five weeks, followed by elections in six months. The future of Hamas's security forces, which were formed in 2007 after the Islamist group first won elections in the Gaza Strip, then forced out Fatah’s security forces, remains unclear. </p><p> Prior to the reconciliation, Netanyahu had said Abbas would have to choose between peace with Israel and peace with Hamas. </p><p> <em>"You can have one but not the other. I hope he chooses peace; so far he hasn't done so,"</em> he said. </p><p> Several senior Israeli officials, including Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Strategic and Intelligence Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, have recently accused Abbas of being anti-Semitic and a Holocaust denier over his book, <em>“The Other Side: the Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism.”</em> </p><p> The book, based on Abbas' 1980s doctoral thesis from the University of Moscow, questioned the number of Jewish Holocaust victims and claimed cooperation between parts of the Zionist movement and Nazi Germany prior to the Holocaust. Abbas has since retracted those claims. </p><p> Many Arab leaders have refrained from making sweeping statements condemning the Holocaust even after striking peace accords with the Jewish state. </p><p> In September, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani acknowledged the Holocaust after years of denials by his predecessor, who had referred to it as a <em>“taboo item”</em> and a <em>"fairy tale."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155180-india-long-range-interceptor/</guid><title><![CDATA[India successfully test-fires long-range interceptor missile]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155180-india-long-range-interceptor/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e2/c0/00/rtx4gsu.jpg" title="FILE photo.

An advanced air defence interceptor missile is launched from Wheeler Island off the Dhamra coast in the eastern Indian state of Orissa. (Reuters / Indian Military)" /> <p> India’s Advanced Air Defence (AAD) interceptor missile on Sunday successfully intercepted an incoming surface-to-surface ballistic missile fired from a ship off the coast in the Bay of Bengal. <br><br><em>"The test was successful,"</em> test range director M.V.K.V. Prasad told IANS. <em>"It is the first time that we have successfully conducted the test of an exo-atmospheric interceptor,"</em> he said. <br><br> The test is part of double-tiered missile defense system that India’s military hopes will provide a multi-layered defense system against any potential ballistic missile strike. </p><p> <em>“It is a system to intercept enemy missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers,”</em> Avinash Chander, the director-general of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), said last week. <em>“The missiles will get intercepted at range of more than 100 kilometers away, so that damage to our cities can be prevented.”</em> </p><p> DRDO has already successfully tested six interceptor missiles, both in endo-atmosphere (within 30 km altitude above sea level) and exo-atmosphere stage (above 30 km altitude). <br><br> The Prithvi Air Defense interceptor missile has already demonstrated its killing capability at an altitude of 50 km and 80 km, while the AAD interceptor has successfully neutralized targets at an altitude of 15 km to 30 km. <br><br> The next step for Indian military technicians is to be able to destroy targets at an altitude of above 100 km, defense sources told Reuters. </p><p> The test moves India closer to membership in a small group of countries – the United States, Russia and Israel – which possess anti-ballistic missile technologies. <br><br> At the same time, the test will arouse suspicion among regional powers China and Pakistan, neighboring nuclear powers that in the past have experienced military confrontations with India. <br><br> At least part of the region’s militarization is related to aggressive moves on the part of the United States, which has moved the bulk of its naval forces into the Pacific region. This decision has triggered something of a domino effect, as heightened Chinese apprehension has prompted Beijing to beef up its capabilities, thus putting pressure on India and Pakistan. <br><br> Indeed, due to the geopolitical shakeup, there has been political pressure for India to rethink its nuclear doctrine that states New Delhi would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in any future theoretical confrontation. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155140-afghanistan-foreign-detention-facilities/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Several 'illegal foreign detention facilities' uncovered in Afghan govt probe]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155140-afghanistan-foreign-detention-facilities/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e0/40/00/000_dv1390902.jpg" title="This picture taken on December 11, 2012 shows a general view of some accommodation at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan's Helmand Province (AFP Photo / John Stillwell)"/><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 13:02:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e0/40/00/000_dv1390902.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Several "unlawful" prisons run by coalition forces in Afghanistan have been uncovered at Camp Bastion and Kandahar airfield in an investigation commissioned by President Hamid Karzai.

In the course of the investigation the team surveyed number of prisoners and the conditions they were kept in. </p><p> Further details and evidence will be released after a full report is made to President Karzai. The issue at Camp Bastion, otherwise known as <a href="http://rt.com/news/uk-prisoners-afghanistan-gitmo-936/" target="_blank">'British Guantanamo'</a>, had not been addressed in the past when the British stood accused of transferring prisoners to facilities where they knew torture was taking place. But it was not made clear in Dadras’s report whether these are the same facilities as the ones he described. </p><p> Similarly, according to the NY Times, the Kandahar case raises questions, as it’s not clear whether Dadras was referring to the regulation which prohibits the detention of an Afghani for a period longer than 96 hours, before handing them over to local forces, or if the team found evidence of a facility that is illegally holding locals. </p><p> </p><p> News of the probe has received a quick response from Washington. Lt. Col. J. Todd Breasseale, a Defense Department spokesman, told the NY Times in an e-mail that <em>“every facility that we use for detention is well known not only by the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, but also by the ICRC.”</em> (The Red Cross has a strict policy of neutrality in matters of conflict.) </p><p> ISAF, the coalition armed forces command, also released a statement Saturday to say that it was <em>“aware of [the Afghan] investigative team looking into the detention facilities in Kandahar and Helmand,”</em> adding that ISAF is <em>“cooperating fully with the investigation on this matter.”</em> </p><p> The Americans then accused Karzai of trying to slander Western tactics in Afghanistan to garner political favor. </p><p> This is the latest in a string of accusations on the issues of detention between the government of outgoing president Karzai and Washington. Earlier this year, Karzai released from the US-run Bagram prison a number of Afghans captured by coalition forces for allegedly killing American troops – another move that stunned the West, who’ve been seeing Karzai’s moves as standoffish, while the leader increasingly accused the United States and Great Britain of gross human rights violations in their treatment of locals. </p><p> The souring relations that, according to the US, complicate cooperation on fighting terrorism have among other things been marked by the Afghan leader’s refusal to sign a bilateral security agreement with Washington regarding the scale of the American operation in Afghanistan after the upcoming military withdrawal in late 2014. </p><p> Although Karzai has been seen by coalition forces to be difficult to deal with, these latest allegations of potential secret torture sites are nothing new in the Western Middle East campaign. Similar revelations were made in 2011 about the Bagram Air Base, where US elite special operations had reportedly held detainees for weeks, US officials revealed to the AP. </p><p> </p><p> Up until that point, Washington denied the existence of any such facilities in Afghanistan, despite evidence and testimony by former detainees and rights groups pointing to the contrary. The Pentagon then said that those were simply temporary holding cells where prisoners were not kept longer than 14 days, but the US officials the AP had spoken to said that this could go up to nine weeks. </p><p> The Joint Special Operations Command at Bagram Air Base was said to run a total of 20 such rendition sites. This is despite President Barack Obama’s criticism of the Bush administration’s handling of the region and its methods for extracting information. </p><p> Also in 2011, it was also <a href="http://rt.com/news/uk-torture-inquiry/" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the British were prepared to use any means necessary for extracting information out of Afghan prisoners, but that inquiry faced big problems before even taking off, and there were complaints from rights groups that the results were heavily doctored. </p><p> After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the CIA’s worldwide network of facilities for the enhanced rendition of Iraq and Afghani terror suspects caused much division even within the agency itself. </p><p> An early April report also reveals cases where CIA officials <a href="http://rt.com/usa/cia-interrogation-senate-legal-040/" target="_blank">requested</a> that torture methods continue, despite analysts’ view that prisoners had no information to offer. This was all in line with the US push to extract information by any means necessary. And the report also found that a number of CIA officials lied to the government about how they attained some of the information, as well as altering a lot of the details to make a solid case for continuing. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155168-us-eu-sanctions-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[US failing to push economic sanctions against Russia through EU allies]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155168-us-eu-sanctions-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e2/00/00/rtr3mrnr.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during joint news conference at the Perdana Putra Building in Putrajaya, April 27, 2014.

(Reuters / Larry Downing)" /> <p> G7 members agreed Friday to roll out a third round of anti-Russian sanctions over the Ukrainian crisis. But those would be an extension of the previous two rounds of sanctions, which targeted 33 individuals in Russia and Ukraine and a Russian bank, which the Western government deemed responsible for the crisis in Ukraine or close enough to President Vladimir Putin to have leverage on him. </p><p> <em>"What we will hear about in the coming days, what we will agree ... is an expansion of existing sanctions, measures against individuals or entities in Russia,"</em> UK Foreign Secretary William Hague told Sky News on Sunday. </p><p> The new round will slap travel bans and asset freezes on 15 more people, according to numerous insider reports. But it’s unlikely that they would have any greater effect on Russian policies than the sanctions already in effect. If anything, so far sanctions against the officials have only resulted in mocking calls from Russian MPs, politicians and ordinary citizens to add their names on the blacklists. </p><p> Imposing sanctions on some sectors of the Russian economy, which could actually hurt the country, remains an elusive goal for Washington. At the same time America, whose economic ties with Russia are mediocre at best compared to Europe’s, is unwilling to act alone. Otherwise, it would appear that there is conflict between Russia and the US, not Russia and the world, a narrative that Washington is struggling to promote. </p><p> <em>"We're going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified and the United States and Europe is unified rather than this is just a US-Russian conflict,"</em> US President Barack Obama told reporters on Sunday. </p><p> But Europe has much to lose from imposing economic sanctions on Russia, and Obama said he sees how US-only sanctions won’t work. </p><p> <em>“If we, for example, say that we are not going to allow certain arms sales to Russia, but every European defense contractor backfills what we do, then it’s not very effective,”</em> he said. </p><p> </p><p> With Russia being a major supplier of raw materials and buyer of European goods, the EU governments are far from being eager to shoot themselves in the foot with economic sanctions. </p><p> <em>“At the moment there is no consensus among the EU members on which economic measures against Russia would be acceptable, or even if they are needed at all,</em>” a European diplomatic source told Itar-Tass. </p><p> The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said only an open military invasion of Ukraine or irrefutable proof of Russian clandestine military presence in Ukraine would tip EU’s stance toward economic sanctions. So far every piece of evidence that Kiev and Washington made public of alleged involvement of Russian agents in Ukraine was either inconclusive or simply false. </p><p> The US and the EU are accusing Russia of stirring up anti-government protest in eastern Ukraine and failing to fulfill its obligations under last week’s Geneva statement. They want Moscow to publicly denounce the protesters holding governmental buildings in Ukraine in defiance of a military crackdown launched by Kiev. </p><p> Russia insists that it is the post-coup Ukrainian government, which is not making necessary steps to deescalate the violence. Moscow says Kiev must disarm radical nationalist groups, particularly the Right Sector, which toppled the previous Ukrainian government, and start negotiations with the protesters instead of threatening them with tanks and multiple rocket launchers. </p><p> If Kiev choses to escalate the crackdown on the protesters by using heavy arms against them Russia says it reserves the right to use its own military to stop bloodshed. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155152-cameron-pedophiles-terrorists-manuals/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pedophiles to be treated like terrorists in UK – Cameron]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155152-cameron-pedophiles-terrorists-manuals/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e1/00/00/000_dv1709978.jpg" title="British Prime Minister David Cameron (AFP Photo / Carl Court)"/><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 11:45:30 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e1/00/00/000_dv1709978.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Pedophiles seeking to download sexual abuse “how to” manuals will be treated like extremists obtaining bombing-making guides online, British Prime Minister David Cameron said, announcing that the measure would be in his Queen’s Speech law program.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e1/00/00/000_dv1709978.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="British Prime Minister David Cameron (AFP Photo / Carl Court)" /> <p> Cameron said he wanted to close a loophole that allows sexual predators to legally produce and possess "manuals" advising them how to identify and groom potential victims, as well as to evade police detection. </p><p> <em>"It's completely unacceptable that there is a loophole in the law which allows pedophiles to write and distribute these disgusting documents.

However, Musk must contend with the so-called United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that has no intention of sharing the pie. </p><p> <em>“If we compete and lose, that is fine,”</em> Musk told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington. <em>“But why would they not even compete it?”</em> </p><p> The American magnate will be going up against some heavy hitters. ULA’s government clients, according to the organization’s website, include <em>“the Department of Defense, NASA, the National Reconnaissance Office and other organizations.”</em> <br><br> Last month, Musk gambled on the Ukraine-crisis card, reminding US congressmen that the Lockheed-Boeing (BA) venture relies on Russian-made Atlas V rockets, designed and produced by NPO Energomash, which, the American innovator believes, could be at risk if the political tensions between the two nuclear powers continue. </p><p> <br><br> Moscow and Washington have remained at diplomatic loggerheads since March when the residents of Crimea, following massive anti-government rioting in the capital Kiev, voted in a referendum to join the Russian Federation. <br><br> Although Russia’s European trading partners have been lukewarm on the idea, Washington, which has had no small influence of its own on Ukrainian politics, has threatened to impose further sanctions on Russia. <br><br> SpaceX said it will file a lawsuit on Monday in an effort to reopen competition for a contract to supply 36 rocket cores, Ian Christopher McCaleb, senior vice president at Levick, a public relations firm representing SpaceX, told Bloomberg. <br><br> Musk, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of Tesla Motors, said it is in the interest of the American people that the contract is challenged because the deal between the Air Force and the defense contractors <em>“is costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars for no reason.”</em> <br><br> Mark Bitterman, a spokesman for ULA, dismissed Musk’s assertions, arguing that the joint venture’s <em>“robust acquisition and oversight process,”</em> together with enhanced technological innovations, actually saved American taxpayers <em>“more than $4 billion”</em> compared with earlier deals. <br><br> SpaceX must complete three successful launches, as well as present an overview review of technical details of its technologies, if it hopes to join the competition for military contracts, according to the Air Force. <br><br> However, there has been no apparent shortage of funding to get Musk’s space ambitions off the ground. <br><br> During a presentation on Friday at the US Export-Import Bank’s annual conference, Musk thanked the financial institution for providing funds. He also mentioned the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which awarded SpaceX a $1.6-billion deal to send shipments to the International Space Station. <br><br><em>“NASA’s been fantastic to work with and really has helped us a lot,”</em> Musk told the conference. <em>“In fact, I’m not sure we’d even be where we are today without the help of NASA. We’re very grateful.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155144-altai-rehap-center-fire/</guid><title><![CDATA[​At least 8 die in drug addict rehab center fire in Russia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155144-altai-rehap-center-fire/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e0/80/00/rian_02338873.hr.en.jpg" title="File photo.

The prisoners were searched and blindfolded and brought to nearby Slavyansk, where their guns, documents and IDs as well as other belongings were demonstrated to the media during a press conference. </p><p> During questioning, the detained officers revealed that a special unit that has infiltrated the city comprised of seven men. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vqaSakthib0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="420"></iframe> </p><p> The captives claimed they had no time for any wrongdoing as they <em>“just arrived”</em> in the city and were getting acquainted with it and investigating approaches for fulfilling their mission, which they admitted was <em>“invariably impossible.”</em> </p><p> They did not say however who authorized the operation and was in control of it.

The agency claimed that they were deployed to the Donetsk region to detain an unnamed Russian citizen suspected of killing Vladimir Rybak, a local MP, who had been found dead near Slavyansk this week by local militia. </p><p> Rybak’s apparent murder is yet another point of conflict between Kiev and the anti-government protesters in eastern Ukraine. The central government said members of the militia must have killed the MP, who spoke against their resistance. Protest leaders said it would make no sense for them to make the discovery of the body public in that case and point fingers to the radical Right Sector, saying the murder was a provocation to frame the militia. </p><p> The agents’ capture came amid an <a href="http://rt.com/news/155104-soledar-ukraine-military-attack/" target="_blank">attack</a> on a checkpoint near the neighboring Soledar city, where a group of unidentified gunmen was flown-in by a helicopter and in a blitz attack captured one of the self-defenders, forcing others to temporary retreat. </p><p> Earlier on Friday, self-defense forces in Slavyansk <a href="http://rt.com/news/155056-ukraine-military-observers-slavyansk/" target="_blank">detained</a> eight foreign military observers, which they are calling <em>“NATO spies.”</em> At the time of the detention the “people’s mayor” of Slavyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov said, the group had <em>“cards with marks of all checkpoints”</em> which he says <em>“serve as proof of their intelligence activities under the guise of the OSCE mission.”</em> </p><p> The detained team is indeed <em>“not OSCE monitors”</em> as widely reported, but instead was sent by OSCE member states in accordance with the 2011 Vienna Document on military transparency, the organization explained on Friday. </p><p> Despite the plea from Moscow and the international community to release the four Germans, a Bulgarian, Czech, Dane and a Pole, Ponomaryov has not acceded to the request yet, as he has not rule out that the group could be used in prisoner exchange for anti-government activists, dozens of whom have been arrested by Kiev's coup-installed authorities over the last month. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155124-press-freedom-violations-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[​US insists going after reporters who publish leaked info 'not violation of press freedom']]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155124-press-freedom-violations-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/df/40/00/freedom-speech-whistleblower-us.jpg" title="US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki (AFP Photo / Nicholas Kamm)"/><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 00:47:12 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/df/40/00/freedom-speech-whistleblower-us.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Announcing its third annual Free the Press campaign to highlight censorship and oppression of journalists “around the world,” the US State Department made clear it doesn’t consider press freedom issues in the United States the same way it does abroad.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/df/40/00/freedom-speech-whistleblower-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki (AFP Photo / Nicholas Kamm)" /> <p> The aim of the third annual Free the Press campaign is to focus attention on <em>“journalists or media outlets that are censored, attacked, threatened, or otherwise harassed because of their reporting.”</em> </p><p> But, apparently, the US' own crackdown on journalists, particularly those involved in whistleblowing, is a completely <em>“separate category”</em> to be highlighted by such an event, as Jen Psaki, the spokesperson for the US State Department made clear. </p><p> <em>“We highlight, as we often do, where we see issues with media freedom around the world,”</em> Psaki told Matthew Lee of the Associated Press, who asked if she believes there are some problems with press freedom in the US that should be discussed as well. </p><p> <em>“Otherwise harassed?”</em> Lee asked. <em>“Does that include those who may have been targeted, harassed, imprisoned, or otherwise, whatever, by the United States Government?”</em> </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MVQgRKbU6v4" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> Getting no clear answer, he continues questioning, asking whether the US administration regards <em>“attempting to prosecute American journalists as an infringement of press freedom?”</em> </p><p> Psaki was quick to reply that she was <em>“not sure”</em> what the AP reporter was referring to exactly. Lee had to specify that among many cases <em>“out there”</em>, he was particularly referring to the <em>“James Risen case.”</em> </p><p> On Friday, the US Justice Department <a href="http://rt.com/usa/155012-doj-scotus-james-risen-case/" target="_blank">urged</a> the US supreme court to reject New York Times correspondent and Pulitzer-Prize winner James Risen's petition on reporter's privilege, which could force him to go to jail for not disclosing his source. The request comes after Obama administration lawyers asked the US Supreme Court to not hear testimony. </p><p> In the State Department, Lee continued his line of questioning, asking Psaki if the US State Department regards Risen's case <em>“as an infringement on press freedom or not.”</em> </p><p> <em>“And I would suspect that you do not, but I want to make sure that’s the case,”</em> he said. </p><p> <em>“As you know, and I’ll of course refer to the Department of Justice, but the leaking of classified information is in a separate category. What we’re talking about here, as you all know, and unfortunately we have to talk about on a regular basis here, is the targeting of journalists,”</em> Psaki answered, adding that that she is referring to “<em>the arrests, the imprisonment, for simply exercising their ability to tell a story.”</em> </p><p> Lee continued his grilling, clarifying that “<em>reporters in question here have not leaked the information”</em> but simply <em>“published it.”</em> </p><p> <em>“So is it correct, then, that you don’t believe – you don’t regard that as an infringement of press freedom?”</em> he asked. </p><p> <em>“We don’t,”</em> Psaki answered, drawing the line under the “Free the Press” campaign announcement. </p><p> New York bases Committee to Protect Journalist (CPJ), in their 2013 report on the freedom of speech in US <a href="http://cpj.org/reports/2013/10/obama-and-the-press-us-leaks-surveillance-post-911.php" target="_blank">noted</a> that the Obama administration continuously violates the freedom to share information. </p><p> <em>“Six government employees, plus two contractors including Edward Snowden, have been subjects of felony criminal prosecutions since 2009 under the 1917 Espionage Act, accused of leaking classified information to the press—compared with a total of three such prosecutions in all previous US Administrations,”</em> CPJ special report says. </p><p> The NGO notes that reporters’ phone logs and e-mails are <em>“secretly subpoenaed and seized by the Justice Department”</em> and in the case of the New York Times reporter, he is being forced to <em>“testify against a defendant or go to jail.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> In 2006, James Risen published a book entitled the “ State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration” exposing CIA abuses he had discovered. </p><p> In particular, chapter 9 of that disclosed an attempt by the CIA to have a former Soviet nuclear scientist subvert the Iranian nuclear program. Arguments presented in Risen's book, forced the US Department of Justice to search his phone, credit card and bank records to compile a case against a former CIA agent Jeffrey Sterling, charged under the Espionage Act, for allegedly leaking the Iranian story to the reporter. </p><p> The DOJ subpoenaed Risen to testify about his business with Sterling. Politico reported Friday that the DOJ has formally asked the Supreme Court not to hear Risen’s appeals to the previous appeals court decision, which Risen won, saying that even if the Supreme Court believes journalists have a right to reporters privilege in criminal cases, Risen’s case presents a poor example. </p><p> <em>“While the question presented does not warrant this court’s review, this case is a particularly unsuitable vehicle,”</em> the government argued Friday. </p><p> In a brief filed Friday, the document says that <em>“although many states recognize a reporter’s privilege of some sort in some circumstances, no ‘consensus’ exists about who qualifies for such a privilege, what types of communications are covered, and the circumstances in which it may be invoked.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155120-living-behind-cnn-curtain/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Living behind the CNN curtain]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155120-living-behind-cnn-curtain/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/df/00/00/living-behind-cnn-curtain.jpg" title="US President Barack Obama (Reuters / Jason Reed)"/><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2014 23:58:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/df/00/00/living-behind-cnn-curtain.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Good Bye, Lenin! is a 2003 German tragicomedy film.

Consumer culture and technology had leaped dramatically during the preceding Cold War years in ways that were unimaginable. </p><p> I am reminded of this film whenever I hear Secretary of State John Kerry or presumptive Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speak. Their words appear to come from a time warp from a previous era before the US middle class fell behind Canada's when measured in terms of standard of living; before America's press freedom dropped to 46 on the Reporters Without Borders league table, and before the America's prison population skyrocketed to over 2 million to swell the profits of private prison operators like Corrections Corp. of America. </p><p> What those living behind what I call the 'CNN Curtain' in America, a population that represents 5% of the world's population miss, is that the other 95% has been busy these past 15 years (post China entering the World Trade Organization) inventing a post-America future. Many think that the past 15 years has been notable for an uptick in globalization but I would posit that the modern growth of financialization is more important; and the commensurate gapping of wealth and income that we've seen - resulting in the most extreme concentration of wealth amongst the new robber barons of Wall St. and the City of London in history. </p><p> In many ways, since China joined the WTO, we've witnessed a de-globalization in terms of a breakaway from the dominant ideology of the 20th century that drove American soft power and global hegemony. Instead of a unipolar world, we've seen a fracturing and a move away from the 'freedom and democracy' meme emanating from Washington D.C. and the rise of the so-called BRIC nations of the East and 'Global South' who see the world quite differently and have the resources and capital to shape their own destinies. </p><p> This is why, at the moment, we are witnessing a gross caricature of America's previous global ideological grip - in the persons of Kerry and Clinton - who appear remarkably out to touch with the times; their news conferences attempting to justify America's latest incursion into Ukraine, become instant verification for the world's 'other 95%' that the US is clueless. </p><h2> Living behind the CNN curtain </h2><p> Just like the people living in East Germany pre-Berlin wall coming down, gradually lost touch with the outside world to the point of a comical disconnect, as portrayed in "Good Bye, Lenin," so too Americans and their leaders appear comically out of the loop. The reason being: they watch CNN and actually believe CNN's narrative about Russian advances into Ukraine, the sanctity of Wall St., and the wholesomeness of American culture as a 'shining city on a hill' as Ronald Reagan called it. </p><p> Living behind the CNN curtain means that 330 million Americans are gradually seceding from the rest of the world - that is now happily moving on - creating their own financial system, their own culture, their own destiny. </p><p> There's John Kerry again talking as if America just landed on the moon and the USD is the unimpeachable stalwart and world reserve currency backed by a growing economy with little debt and lots of gold. HAHAHAHAHA! Sometimes the effect is even more detached. Sometimes it's as if John Kerry's words have been broadcast from a planet 20 or 30 light years away and are now just reaching us. </p><p> Will the US ever, 'tear down that CNN wall' as Reagan may have put it, and rejoin the world community? </p><p> I would like to see America once again be a thought leader and lead by example. It would be great if the U.S. didn't resolve all their disputes with drones and autocratic fiat dictates that authorize summary executions of political enemies in the U.S. and abroad; including US citizens. </p><p> It would be nice to not feel embarrassed every time a John McCain, John Kerry or Hillary Clinton speaks in public. I hope that day comes again.In the meantime, watch RT and see what the other 95% are up to. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155116-uk-teen-drug-ritual/</guid><title><![CDATA[​British teen dies in Colombia drug ritual]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155116-uk-teen-drug-ritual/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/de/c0/00/uk-teen-drug-ritual.jpg" title="Reuters / Desmond Boylan"/><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2014 22:02:54 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/de/c0/00/uk-teen-drug-ritual.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A British teenager was found dead by the side of the road by police in a remote rainforest area of Colombia after taking hallucinogenic Yage in a tribal ritual with other tourists.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/de/c0/00/uk-teen-drug-ritual.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Desmond Boylan" /> <p> Henry Miller, a 19-year old from Bristol, who was on a gap year is understood to have taken Yage, which causes vivid hallucinations and is used by local tribes for its supposedly spiritual and healing properties, The Daily Mail reports. </p><p> Henry’s father said in a statement that he had reacted badly to the plant infusion. </p><p> <em>“We understand that he took part in a local tribal ritual recommended by the hostel that he was staying at. The ritual involves a drink made from local plant infusions,”</em> he said. </p><p> One of his fellow travellers, Mr Dearden, said that Henry drank a cup of the infusion twice on Sunday and on Tuesday while staying in Mocoa a remote town in the Putumayo region. </p><p> Dearden said that the drug had no effect on Mr Miller the first time but when he took it again he became extremely ill. </p><p> A group of about eight people all took the drug and were all sick afterwards, which is apparently a normal reaction to taking it, but while they all came round Henry didn’t. </p><p> <em>“He just got worse and worse. He was lying face down on the ground making very weird breathing noises. We picked him up and put him in a chair. He wasn’t speaking; he was lashing out with his hands and feet. Then he started making weird animal noises, pig sounds and at one point he tried to fly. He kept on saying 'what’s going on, oh My God” and holding his face,'</em>” said Dearden. </p><p> The Shaman family the backpackers were staying with said they’d look after him, but when they woke up in the morning they found that Henry wasn’t there. </p><p> Soon after the police arrived and showed them a picture of Henry’s body which they said had been dumped a by a dirt track. Police said that he had a crack on his head and may have fallen off or been thrown from a motorbike. </p><p> Yage, also known as Ayahuasca, is a drink with psychedelic qualities made from leaves and is used by natives in South America. Despite its supposed healing and spiritual qualities it also causes nausea, diarrhea and psychological distress. </p><p> The writer William S Burroughs documented the effects of the drug in his book The Yage Letters. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155112-washington-policy-europe-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Junta government in Kiev trigger for mine that will explode sooner or later’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155112-washington-policy-europe-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/de/80/00/washington-policy-europe-ukraine-.jpg" title="Armed anti-goverment  activists stand guard next to a barricade at a checkpoint outside the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk on April 24, 2014 after Ukrainian troops left (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2014 20:02:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/de/80/00/washington-policy-europe-ukraine-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The combination of the polices of the government in Kiev and Washington blaming Russia for events is pushing the situation in Ukraine to a critical mass which threaten peace in Europe Willie Wimmer, former Vice President of the OSCE, tells RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/de/80/00/washington-policy-europe-ukraine-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Armed anti-goverment  activists stand guard next to a barricade at a checkpoint outside the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk on April 24, 2014 after Ukrainian troops left (AFP Photo)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>As it stands at the moment, America seems to think the more Russia is punished here, the more sorted the situation will be, do you agree with that?</em> </p><p> <strong>Willie Wimmer:</strong> I think the situation is totally complicated and everything we know perhaps goes back to the Cuban crisis some decades ago. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>In that the Cold War continues?</em> </p><p> <strong>WW:</strong> I think it’s even more complicated. It’s not only a Cold War it can be outstanding and dangerous and when we go back to the Cuban crisis, we know that big powers usually draw a red line and for the Americans it had been 90 km away from Miami there shouldn’t be a Soviet nuclear arsenal. And here in the Ukraine, it’s again similar. The Russian Federation draws a red line and they are not interested in having a country direct in their neighborhood who might change itself into a living danger, like a land mine, like a nuclear arsenal, which is located next to my own border. And therefore I think we face a critical situation in the next few weeks, perhaps even the next days and we only can hope that somebody might intervene in a sympathetic way and not create war in Europe. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What’s the attitude in your country, in Germany, I mean your closer to the border than America certainly is. What do most Germans think about this these days?</em> </p><p> <strong>WW:</strong> I think most Germans, they have really problems when they look at the actual situation and there is a lot of fear ongoing. This fear might be in a critical situation when it comes to the visit of our chancellor to Washington in the next week or so and many people think that Angela Merkel might arrive in Washington and we still have peace and when she will come back to Berlin there might be a different situation, perhaps even war. And therefore there’s an ongoing fear in Germany because of the situation and they don’t blame Russia for this situation, they look on Washington. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>And it’s Washington that’s pushing Europe here then yeah, as you see it?</em> </p><p> <strong>WW:</strong> It’s not only Washington pushing the Europeans, its Washington which organized the events which are going on in the Ukraine, and we can go back to remarks being made by Mrs. Nuland that they invested more than 6 billion dollars to create such a critical mass, which led in the end to the Maidan development and therefore they want a return of investment. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>You’re a much respected diplomat, politician over the years, how do you think this is going to play out over the next month or so?</em> </p><p> <strong>WW:</strong> I hope that we have some negotiations for an agreement and when we back to the Cuban crisis it was a direct link between President Kennedy and Secretary General Khrushchev who made it possible to find a solution and therefore I think it’s not a question of negotiations, there has to be direct contact between Obama and Putin, otherwise we face more than a critical situation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>How much of a role does the local interim Ukrainian government have here then, it’s kind of out of their hands, in Washington’s hands, because we’ve got them calling the people in the east here a mob?</em> </p><p> <strong>WW:</strong> I think the junta, as far as I see it in Kiev, is playing a dangerous card. They are acting against their own population as if they would be enemies, you can’t keep tanks and artillery and planes going against your own people, as long as they have occupied houses or have barricades. Usually in these circumstances this is a question for the police and not for the military. And therefore I think the junta In Kiev is like trigger for a mine, and this mine will explode sooner or later. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155092-keystone-pipeline-washington-protest/</guid><title><![CDATA[#NoKXL: Thousands march in D.C. against Keystone pipeline]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155092-keystone-pipeline-washington-protest/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/dd/40/00/keystone-pipeline-washington-protest-.jpg" title="Members of the The Cowboy and Indian Alliance protest across the street from US Secretary of State John Kerry's house April 25, 2014 in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC, with &quot;a traditional ceremony praying that the secretary listens to his conscious and the science and rejects Keystone XL&quot; (AFP Photo / Paul J.

(RIA Novosti / Captions translated by RT)" /> <p> RIA Novosti on Saturday published satellite images showing the buildup of troops near the eastern Ukrainian anti-government stronghold of Slavyansk. The photos, which are said to have been taken during the latest stage of the so-called “anti-terrorist operation” ordered by Kiev, are dated April 24-25. <br><br> The images appear to show part of military hardware used for the current Ukrainian troops’ objective of <em>“<a href="http://rt.com/news/154860-ukraine-slavyansk-military-operation/" target="_blank">isolating</a>”</em> Slavyansk. <br><br> This photo says that a group of 21 APCs are visible at the time of observation (center). It shows the northern outskirts of Slavyansk where an animal feed stuff factory is located (lower center). </p><p> </p><p> Another group of 22 APCs is said to have been spotted 4 kilometers to the west of Slavyansk at the territory of a dairy farm. Ten tanks and 11 BMDs (airborne combat vehicles) are visible in another segment of the farm’s territory pictured above. </p><p> </p><p> Groups of APCs can also be seen amassed on the western outskirts of Slavyansk. </p><p> </p><p> A Russian Defense Ministry source commenting on the photos to RIA Novosti said that they show only a fraction of the force encircling the city. <br><br> According to the source, 160 tanks, 230 APCs and BMDs, and at least 150 artillery and rocket systems, including “Grad” and “Smerch” multiple rocket launchers, have been deployed to the area. A total of 15,000 troops are positioned near Slavyansk, he said. <br><br> The size of the force is <em>“incommensurable”</em> to that of the city’s self-defense, the source said, adding that it would be enough <em>“to raze the city to the ground with all its residents.”</em> <br><br> Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu on Thursday said the large buildup of Ukraine troops, as well as war games and additional deployments of armed forces to the NATO states in the region have <em>“forced”</em> Russia to respond with <a href="http://rt.com/news/154588-russia-drill-ukraine-operation/" target="_blank">military drills</a> of its own. <br><br><em>“The order to use force against civilians has already been given, and if this military machine is not stopped, the amount of casualties will only grow,”</em> Shoigu said during an official meeting in Moscow. <br><br> Self-defense activists believe that Russia’s move has dissuaded the coup-imposed Kiev authorities from storming Slavyansk, with troops only raiding checkpoints on the outskirts of the city and then retreating. However, Ukrainian acting defense minister, Mikhail Koval, on Saturday asserted that the military operation continues as planned <em>“although its pace is not high.”</em> <br><br> Speaking to journalists on the activity of the Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, Koval also <a href="http://rt.com/news/155084-russia-planes-ukraine-airspace/" target="_blank">contradicted</a> earlier claims of border violations coming from Kiev and Washington. The Russian aircraft spotted flying along the Ukrainian border were transport airplanes, not fighter jets, and they never crossed the borderline, he said. Also, the closest distance that the Russian troops came to the Ukrainian border was 2-3 kilometers, he revealed. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155100-ukraine-gas-debt-eu/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukraine's failure to pay gas debt may cut gas supply to Europe - Russia’s energy minister]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155100-ukraine-gas-debt-eu/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/dd/c0/00/ukraine-gas-debt-eu.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Sergey Supinsky"/><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2014 19:23:34 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/dd/c0/00/ukraine-gas-debt-eu.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine’s growing gas debt may lead to the failure of the country’s transit obligations and the reduction of gas supplies to south-eastern Europe, said the Russian Energy Ministry.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/dd/c0/00/ukraine-gas-debt-eu.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Sergey Supinsky" /> <p> Officials from Russia, including Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, and officials from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Moldova held talks in Moscow on Saturday. <br><br> The meeting, also attended by officials from the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and the Finance Ministry, was held in the form of consultations on the security of gas transit through Ukraine. <br><br> All sides expressed deep concern about Ukraine’s growing debt, Novak told journalists. <br><br><em>“Currently Ukraine’s debt is US$2.238 billion, this [figure] does not include gas deliveries made in April,”</em> Novak noted. <em>“The debt will rise 1.3 billion for the April deliveries.”</em> <br><br> Ukraine’s debt may lead to a situation where not enough gas will be pumped into Ukrainian underground storage facilities, which may create the risk of non-performance by Ukraine of its transit obligations and of undersupply of gas to Southeastern Europe, the ministry said. <br><br> In turn the parties discussed the importance of gas transportation projects designed to reduce transit risks for European consumers, primarily the South Stream project. <br><br><em>“Today, only the South Stream project can give Europe real additional guarantees of energy security,"</em> said Miller on Friday. <br><br> Russia also discussed with the participants the efforts to organize negotiations with the European Commission and Ukraine on how to deal with Kiev's failure to pay for gas. <br><br> Novak said that the talks on the IMF stabilization loan will soon be held. The use of a portion of the IMF loan to repay the debt for previous gas supplies will be discussed there he added. </p><p> Russia said it hopes the EU <em>“will take measures towards the speediest disbursement of financial aid to Ukraine by European financial institutions, which will be used, among other things, for ensuring Naftogaz of Ukraine's timely payments for natural gas supplies from Gazprom"</em>, the ministry said. <br><br> The ministry believes this will help to prevent unauthorized siphoning of gas from transit in Ukraine and strengthen Europe's energy security. </p><p> Gazprom’s $45 billion South Stream project is due to partially open in 2015 and reach full capacity in 2018. It will deliver 64 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe, running through EU countries Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, and soon to be EU member Serbia. The line connects Russia to Europe via the Black Sea and will supply Europe with 15 percent of its gas needs. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155104-soledar-ukraine-military-attack/</guid><title><![CDATA[Airborne gunmen attack Ukrainian militia checkpoint near weapons depot]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155104-soledar-ukraine-military-attack/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/de/00/00/soledar-ukraine-military-attack-.jpg" title="A Ukrainian military helicopter flies near the village of Malinivka, east of Slaviansk in eastern Ukraine April 25, 2014 (Reuters / Baz Ratner)"/><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2014 17:59:41 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/de/00/00/soledar-ukraine-military-attack-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Self-defense forces have repelled an attack on a checkpoint in the city of Soledar in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region after gunmen landed in a helicopter and launched a blitz attack.

The journalist was only fulfilling his duties as a correspondent for the TV channel and tried to obtain non-classified information, LifeNews said on its website. </p><p> The checkpoint was located not far from the Barvenkovo railway station, through which Kiev troops were redeployed ahead of the military operation against anti-government protesters in the town of Slavyansk, Golyandin told RT. He said their crew got to the venue in a taxi and – when they saw foreign journalists being thoroughly searched – decided not to risk continuing and stopped. </p><p> Golyandin decided first to have a talk with the armed people at the site and ask them if he could interview any of them and film. The reporter said he held his press card in his right hand, so that the military could see it. However, as he was about 30 meters from the checkpoint, guards on the perimeter of the facility “<em>pointed machine guns at me</em>,” he said. </p><p> “<em>I was told in rather a rude way to lie on the ground, face down. I bent on my knees. Two guys with machine guns and another person with a gun approached me on one side, and two more guys with machine guns on the other,</em>” he said in a comment to RT. </p><p> The military behaved in “<em>a pretty aggressive</em>” way, he noted. Only after they found that he was a journalist was Golyandin allowed to get back on his feet and talk to them for some time. Still, they banned the journalist from using his camera and filming anything. </p><p> However, in a private conversation the soldiers told the Russian journalists that “<em>they do not want a war,</em>” Golyandin said. In their opinion Right Sector’s special forces Dnepr-1 and Dnepr-2 are behind “<em>all provocations and firing at checkpoints,</em>” Golyandin said. </p><p> “<em>Then we were told to get out of the place as soon as possible,</em>” the LifeNews reporter added. </p><p> The incident was recorded, however, by a foreign correspondent present at the site and the image was later posted in Global Look Press and other photo banks. </p><p> In a separate incident this week, two LifeNews journalists were detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) while they were filming an interview with an opposition leader and then deported to Russia. </p><p> On Monday, Simon Ostrovsky, a journalist for the New York-based Vice News, was detained by self-defense forces in Slavyansk, eastern Ukraine. He was <a href="http://rt.com/news/154772-ostrovsky-vice-journalist-released/" target="_blank">released</a> three days later, on Thursday. </p><p> Lately, there have been an increasing number of incidents with Russian journalists on Ukrainian territory, with reporters being detained, questioned for hours, threatened, deported or banned from entering the country. </p><p> Heads of Russian TV channels, including RT, have <a href="http://rt.com/news/155000-russian-media-press-protection/" target="_blank">called</a> on international organizations to protect the rights and dignity of journalists covering the Ukraine crisis from illegal actions of the Kiev authorities. In a letter addressed to the UN, UNESCO and the OSCE they urged them to “<em>defend the professional rights of journalists working in Ukraine</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155088-neo-nazi-march-disrupted/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Shortest march in recent history’: Antifascist groups disrupt neo-Nazi rally in Berlin (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155088-neo-nazi-march-disrupted/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/dd/00/00/neo-nazi-march-disrupted.jpg" title="An activist of the far-right NPD party holds a sign reading &quot; Example Switzerland- Stop mass immigration&quot; (Vorbild Schweiz- Masseneinwanderung Stoppen) during a demonstration of the far-right NPD party in Berlin on April 26, 2014.

Abe did tout the TPP as the <em>“third arrow”</em> of his economic revival of Japan. It’s more like the arrow of death. Still, there’s no way for TPP to happen without a previous, bilateral US-Japan pact – and here problems remains intractable. </p><h2> Now for the hidden agenda </h2><p> When Obama hits the South China Sea things will get even choppier. The South China Sea is the heart of Eurasia’s naval hinterland– through which flows a third of the global naval action and of course all those millions of tons of oil being transported from the Indian Ocean across the mega-strategic Malacca strait and then the South China Sea towards East Asia (including, crucially, 80 percent of China’s oil imports.) </p><p> The hidden agenda here is for the US Navy to forever remain as the hyperpower in the South China Sea – without allowing Beijing as much as a possibility of reaching parity with it. Thus the Pentagon’s carefully orchestrated propaganda selling the myth that the South China Sea without the hegemonic US would be a hellish chaos. </p><p> Obama is visiting Malaysia and the Philippines, two Southeast Asian at opposing poles. Malaysia, for starters, sits between the Middle East and China, at the heart of complex global trade networks. In many aspects, Malaysia may be seen as the heart of Asia. </p><p> </p><p> Unlike Vietnam – which is hyper-nationalist – Malaysia, crucially, does not want trouble with China. US warships already “visit” Malaysia at least 50 times a year – and that includes nuclear submarines hanging out in ports in Borneo. </p><p> Two French-Spanish submarines bought by Malaysia are stationed at a base in Sabah, near the Spratly islands – where Malaysia claims 12 islands or rocks. </p><p> The global war on terror (GWOT) was the perfect pretext for the Pentagon to extend to Malaysia some state of the art radar equipment. So, in a nutshell, after Singapore – which could easily be described as a corporate-friendly US aircraft carrier positioned near the Malacca strait – Malaysia is in fact a very reliable US ally in the South China Sea. </p><h2> That beautiful, and messy, archipelago </h2><p> The Philippines are immensely messier. To start with, the archipelago of 7,000-plus islands is roughly divided into three groups. </p><p> In Luzon in the north people speak Tagalog. In Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago in the south there are plenty of Moro Muslims – culturally they have more to do with Malays and Indonesians. And then in the middle sit the Visayas, which include Cebu. The whole thing accounts for no less than 35,000 kilometers of coastline to be patrolled, and that in a very poor country. </p><p> China is the Philippines’ third largest trading partner. The Chinese diaspora is extremely influent in trade and commerce. The Philippines import all their oil by sea – so the possibility of exploring new oil and gas reserves in the Spratlys and in the fiercely disputed Scarborough Shoal are a matter of national security. </p><p> The Spratlys – 150 rocks or islands, only 48 of them above water all the time – were named in 1843 after the master of a British whaler, Richard Spratly. Yet Filipinos call them Kalayaan (“Freedomland”). There’s even a mayor of Kalayaan. </p><p> What Obama is getting from Manila is an agreement for greater access for US ships and planes to military bases, after the Pentagon convinced the locals to focus on “maritime domain awareness” with the purpose of – what else? – containing China. </p><p> So expect <em>“rotational”</em> US presence in Philippine ports, and even transforming pristine Ulugan Bay on the Western Philippine island of Palawan – very close to the Spratlys – into a future naval base, to the utter despair of environmentalists. </p><p> So gone will be the (sovereign) days when Washington was forced to surrender the sprawling Subic Bay base in 1992 (before that, Manila received $200 million annually in military aid from Washington.) There’s a consensus in Manila that the only possible leverage against China’s claims in the South China Sea is an alliance with the US – and that in itself is also asymmetrical. Still, they do want US ships in their waters – following the Singapore (and Vietnam) model; let’s build ports for the Americans, and they will come. </p><p> Filipinos are positively paranoid about the Chinese prying everywhere across what they call the Western Philippine Sea – in places like Woody Island and Douglas Bank – planning to take over any particle of rock above sea level. Why? According to the Filipino version, because Beijing badly needs and wants to take over Filipino-owned oil and gas. </p><p> No wonder the US Navy was quick to exploit high-level Filipino insecurity to forge what amounts to a neo-colonial relationship. </p><p> </p><h2> What about the Law of the Sea? </h2><p> The Obama administration’s <em>“pivoting to Asia”</em> – as in containment of China – always eludes the key question; for Beijing, a coalition of small Southeast Asian powers allied with the US is absolutely anathema. If that’s the case, expect major fireworks. </p><p> Washington – as usual – extols the rule of international law, but the US has not even signed the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.Beijing wants a regional order – after all it is the dominant regional power. And it’s adamant on its historical claims – facts on the sea happening way before the Law of the Sea. </p><p> Meanwhile, it is a claiming free for all. For example, China claims the waters where one finds the Filipino natural gas fields of Malampaya and Camago. </p><p> The current exclusive economic zones, imposed by everyone, led to every player getting in theory energy-wealthy shallow areas near coastlines, while China south of its coastline didn’t get much apart from Pratas island, Macclesfield Bank and Scarborough Shoal. </p><p> Still, no matter what they could possibly extract and market, Malaysia and Philippines would still have to import oil and gas. So the South China Sea will remain crucial as much as a possible repository of oil and gas riches as for its increasingly congested transit sealanes. </p><p> As for the US invoking a legal mechanism to protect <em>“freedom of navigation”,</em> that’s rubbish; the real thing for the Americans is the state of the art Chinese submarine base in Hainan island which houses diesel-electric submarines and nuclear ballistic missile submarines. That’s the real secret of the Southeast Asian leg of Obama’s “pivoting to Asia”. And that was instrumental in the launch of the pivoting itself in 2011. </p><p> There is a solution for the South China Sea; deal after deal after deal. They ought to be negotiated in the cadre of the 10-member Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) – even considering that Beijing can, and does, explore internal divisions. </p><p> In a non-Hobbesian world, the ideal, realistic solution would be manageable to the benefit of all players, so everyone would be able to prospect for oil and gas. But the problem is that every player – except Malaysia – is juggling hardcore politics with deep emotional, nationalistic overtones. And in this environment only one external player really benefits; the United “<em>Pacific nation”</em> States of America. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
