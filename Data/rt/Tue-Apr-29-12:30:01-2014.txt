The mistake went unnoticed for several years and brings into question how ‘healthy’ Bank of America is.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fb/00/00/bank-of-america.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Spencer Platt / Getty Images/  AFP " /> <p> After reporting the miscalculation to the Federal Reserve, Bank of America will also have to re-do its stress tests, to ensure it isn’t <a href="http://www.rt.com/business/us-banks-crisis-fed-325/" target="_blank"><em>"too big"</em></a> and has sufficient capital reserves, the New York Times reports. </p><p> Stocks have fallen 6.27 percent on the news, the most since November 2012. Shares tumbled to $14.95 by market close in New York on Monday, erasing all of the 2014 gains. </p><p> The error was sourced to Merrill Lynch, where lower-level employees botched the numbers they submit to the financial authorities for a quarterly securities filing. The gaffe also went undiscovered by the bank’s board of directors as well as PricewaterhouseCoopers, its external auditor. The US Federal Reserve also missed the blunder. </p><p> <a href="http://www.rt.com/business/us-banks-stress-test-860/" target="_blank">Stress tests</a>, called Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, are a way for the US Federal Reserve to assess whether financial intuitions have adequate capital. The protocol is part of the Dodd-Frank Act, which seeks to avoid a repeat of the 2008 collapse with precautionary regulations. </p><p> In March Bank of America passed its Federal Reserve stress test even though it provided faulty information. Citigroup Inc. was one of five banks that failed the test. According to Bank of America’s first quarter earnings report, it has $134 billion in Tier 1 capital, which has now been reduced to $130 billion. </p><p> <em>“Bank of America must address the quantitative errors in its regulatory capital calculations as part of the resubmission and must undertake a review of its regulatory capital reporting to help ensure there are no further errors,”</em> the US Federal Reserve said in a statement. </p><p> Bank of America scooped up Merrill Lynch, also a Wall Street investment giant, in January 2009 in the aftermath of the 2008 American financial crisis. Bank of America has been led by Brian Moynihan since 2010, who has been tasked with sorting out liabilities inherited from the acquisition. </p><p> In the first 3 months of 2013, the company reported a $276 billion deficit, the first quarterly loss under Moynihan’s tenure as CEO. </p><p> Bank of America has gained a bad reputation over its sloppy, and even sometimes illegal cooperate practices. In March, the bank was <a href="http://rt.com/business/bank-america-fine-regulator-569/" target="_blank">ordered to pay $9.5 billion</a> to the Federal Housing Finance Agency to resolve allegations that it misled investors over the quality of mortgage loan sales. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155564-euro-elections-candidate-ridiculous/</guid><title><![CDATA[Euro elections: Searching for President Nemo]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155564-euro-elections-candidate-ridiculous/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fa/c0/00/eu.jpg" title="An European Union flag flutters outside of the European Parliament in Brussels (Reuters / Francois Lenoir)"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 08:56:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fa/c0/00/eu.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​The European Parliament is at the most productive part of its four-year cycle. Instead of adding more stifling rules, politicians are out seeking re-election to the ridiculous Brussels/Strasbourg gravy train.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fa/c0/00/eu.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="An European Union flag flutters outside of the European Parliament in Brussels (Reuters / Francois Lenoir)" /> <p> Thus Europeans are spared the indignity of more useless micromanaging regulation destroying employment and the economy for at least two months every four years. </p><p> Thousands of candidates across 28 nations are chasing a resource-rich (i.e. expenses-laden) opportunity to micromanage Europe to destitution. EU apathy continues to accelerate: since introducing direct elections in 1979, voter turnout has been in constant decline ever since. </p><p> The end May pan-European elections will see a broad swathe of apathy from east to west, despite desperate federalist attempts to stir up interest. In one vacuous ploy to create electoral momentum, three leading political groupings have nominated candidates who might gain one of the posts marked <em>‘president’</em> within the staggering unaccountable Brussels bureaucracy (other groups have sensibly heaped derision on the idea). </p><p> At least one form of Euro-harmonization has been achieved. All three deluded <em>‘presidential’</em> candidates are essentially impossible to discern. As swathes of online videos demonstrate, most Europeans can’t recognize any of them. </p><p> Thus a form of false presidential election is being fought by three people who, frankly (having never seen them all in the same room), I suspect are the same man. These dull, wonkish candidates maintain a blithe regard to the fact nobody has ever heard of them. They are so similar that there is barely a cigarette paper of difference between them. (N.B. The previous sentence is in clear violation of EU ordinances as it could be construed as promoting smoking and also, heinously, endorses an alternative measurement system to metric). Classic machine politicians from the European lowlands, their position on the left-right scale is subsumed by Europhilia (they are all corporate socialists: adding ‘big’ to anything. Well, except <em>‘growth’</em>). </p><p> Most importantly, they all subscribe to one totalitarian overarching credo: whatever the issue, the only solution is more Europe. </p><p> </p><p> Given that this increasingly demented Europhilia has delivered two decades where Europe has appreciably underperformed both Asia and North America, those harboring a tinge of economic sanity might regard that as grounds for a change of plan alone. However, note the key point above, the only solution hard-wired into the Single Europhile Brain Cell is: more Europe. Resistance is futile. </p><p> Or maybe not. </p><p> Unsurprisingly, many voters, mired in the EU stasis of the north or the euro depression in the south, reckon Europe isn’t working. </p><p> This leading candidate trio includes Martin Schulz, a crazed center-left Europhile of old school socialist traditions, who, like the arguably even more fundamentalist Liberal Guy Verhofstadt, is forever fighting a self-perceived war against the bigotry of nationalism. The tricky bit is how bigoted they are when it comes to any of the multitude of justifiable criticisms against the fetidly corrupt Euro apparatus. If that sounds akin to a trip down totalitarian dogma memory lane, then far be it from me to differ. </p><p> Alongside a Saarland German, we have the (almost obligatory) line-up of former Belgian and Luxembourg prime ministers: Guy Verhofstadt and Jean-Claude Juncker respectively. Each is at the center of an electoral charade/conceit: criss-crossing Europe campaigning for a presidency which will eventually be decided at one of those lavish dinners where national leaders traditionally suspend democracy and the <em>‘Buggins’</em> turn’ system of proportional representation is deployed to allocate key posts. </p><p> Meritocracy is very much secondary to Europhilia in Brussels, as evidenced by Britain’s Cathy Ashdown, whose occupancy of the foreign portfolio has resembled an artless prank. Regardless of the <em>‘popular’</em> vote, expect the various presidents to be chosen via the usual behind closed doors botch up, as Mrs. Merkel has already clearly hinted. </p><p> Astute readers may wonder how growing Euroskepticism will influence the new parliament? In a direct swipe against democracy, the usual EU rules will apply: ignore the problem, ridicule the complaints and press for more Europe! Given that the answer is always <em>“More Europe!”</em> the three leading parties will suspend left-right ideological differences to concentrate on their single state delusion. </p><p> Given that the European Parliament could be 25, even 30 percent explicitly critical - if not outright skeptical - of the EU’s vast failings, readers may wish to ponder just how the EU can claim to have any remote attachment to the democracy it wishes to foist on others when its own process has become a travesty. </p><p> Meanwhile Europe continues to waste taxpayers’ money in the search for President Nobody. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155572-ryabkov-ukraine-south-crimea/</guid><title><![CDATA[Russia won't repeat 'Crimea scenario' in southeastern Ukraine - Russian Deputy FM]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155572-ryabkov-ukraine-south-crimea/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fb/40/00/ryabkov.jpg" title="Sergey Ryabkov (RIA Novosti / Andrey Stenin)&#10;"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 08:52:45 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/fb/40/00/ryabkov.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Russia is not going to repeat “The Crimean scenario” in southeastern Ukraine, said the country’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fb/40/00/ryabkov.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Sergey Ryabkov (RIA Novosti / Andrey Stenin)
" /> <p> <em>“I think what happened in Crimea turned out to be a big shock for Western partners. They can’t tolerate it. And they see the same scenario in southeastern Ukraine,”</em> he told Gazeta.ru<strong>.</strong> </p><p> According to Ryabkov, the Kiev authorities should give people from southeastern Ukraine a chance to participate in shaping the future of their own country. </p><p> <em>“It’s a normal desire [to decide your country’s future]. It is the basis of any democratic process,”</em> he added. </p><p> Ryabkov says he doesn’t consider the protesters in Slavyansk and Donetsk, in Donetsk Region, as separatists. </p><p> <em>“These are the people who insist on their rights, including the right to their language and access to information,”</em> he said. </p><p> According to Russian Deputy FM, the Kiev authorities and their <em>“puppeteers in Washington and some European capitals”</em> aren’t fulfilling the conditions of the April-17 Geneva agreements. </p><p> <em>“They [Kiev and the West] claim that we [Russia] aren’t complying with the agreements but they haven’t shown any evidence that they are fulfilling them,”</em> he said. </p><p> He gave a reminder that the main issue surrounding these agreements is the disarmament of the Pravy Sektor (Right Sector) nationalist group and freeing seized streets and squares across Ukraine. </p><p> However, Right Sector is still “<em>running the show”</em> in the streets of Ukraine, while Western countries only make claims and criticize anti-government protesters in the south-east, he added. </p><p> Meanwhile, Ryabkov compared future sanctions on suspending US exports of high tech products to the Iron Curtain, an ideological conflict and physical boundary separating the Soviet Union from the other countries during the Cold War period. </p><p> <em>“This [sanctions] is the revival of the system of 1949 when Western countries in fact drew “the iron curtain” on the import of high-tech products to the Soviet Union and other countries,”</em> he said, <em>“Now, in 2014 the US are trying to do the same.”</em> </p><p> However, despite all the sanctions issued by Western powers, Russia doesn’t want to break relations with either the EU, or the US. </p><p> <em>“We have a lot of economic ties [with the US and EU].

The property was sold for $116,000 to cover the debt, in what the woman argued was an improper move by the authorities.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f9/40/00/tax-sale.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Justin Sullivan / Getty Images / AFP " /> <p> The home of Eileen F. Battisti, 53, was sold at a September 2011 tax sale to cover the paltry debt, which arose from an interest rate charge on Battisti’s 2009 tax bill. Beaver County auctioned off the house, with an estimated value of $280,000, selling it for $116,000 to SP Lewis. </p><p> <em>"I paid everything, and didn't know about the $6.30,"</em> she told AP. <em>"For the house to be sold just because of $6.30 is crazy."</em> </p><p> Battisti appealed the move, saying she didn’t know she owed the past due charge until she was notified that her home would be sold. Beaver Country court initially denied her evidentiary hearings on the case, but Battisti turned to the Commonwealth Court in Harrisburg, which in August 2013 ordered the county court to review the case. </p><p> Last week, County Judge C. Gus Kwidis ruled against Battisti, saying she had been properly notified of her debt and that the sale followed state law. In his six-page order, the judge said the former homeowner is entitled to $108,039 in proceeds from the sale after her tax obligations are met. </p><p> <em>“She's going to get that money, but she's going to lose her house. All the notice requirements were met,”</em> Kwidis said on Friday as cited by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. <em>“In tax assessment laws, even if I feel sorry for her, I can't do anything to help her. ... Everyone felt bad about it.”</em> </p><p> Battisti plans to appeal the ruling before the Commonwealth Court, she said. </p><p> Joe Askar, Beaver County's chief solicitor, said the judge got the decision right. </p><p> <em>"The county never wants to see anybody lose their home, but at the same time the tax sale law, the tax real estate law, doesn't give a whole lot of room for error either,"</em> Askar said. </p><p> Battisti’s lawyer Ed Santillan said his client would lose about $200,000 in equity if she accepts the sale proceeds and that she wants to keep her home. Battisti said Lewis, the new homeowner, has offered to return it to her for a “ridiculous” $260,000. </p><p> Lewis' attorney could not be reached for comments. </p><p> Despite the sale, Battisti and her three children were allowed to stay in the house while legal proceedings in the case are underway. </p><p> <em>“I'm going to fight it until my dying day,”</em> Battisti pledged. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155544-air-france-prostitution-sex/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Sex-traffic control: Air France exec, wife run prostitution racket worth millions]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155544-air-france-prostitution-sex/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f9/80/00/prostitite.jpg" title="AFP Photo DDP / Martin Oeser"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 08:52:31 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f9/80/00/prostitite.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />An executive at Air France used the airline to run a lucrative prostitution ring.

They stand accused of human trafficking, pimping and organized crime, according to a Saturday report by Le Parisien. The three are now being kept at prisons in Val-de-Marne and Essonne, police sources told the French newspaper. </p><p> The business had been generating 2 million euro a year since 2010. Alain D. had managed flight crews at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, and was in a position to get sizeable discounts on tickets he used to transport women back and forth between France and Brazil, according to vice squad detectives. </p><p> Trips for new flesh would take place every month. Each time the trio returned, they’d present the girls as relatives. This reaped the bonus of traveling for 150 euro per person - a privilege reserved for families of Air France employees. </p><p> A break in the case came when one of the women, a student from Brazil who had arrived for university studies in 2010, somehow managed to escape her captors and report the prostitution ring to the police three years later. She had apparently been forced to be a sex worker by Claudia D. </p><p> A police source told Le Parisien that <em>“Claudia D. had settled the young woman in an apartment on Rue de Rivoli in the 1st district, where she was to receive five customers per day. Sexual services were priced at up to 150 euro.”</em> It was actually the wife who was allegedly in charge of managing the sex network: placing online ads, setting up appointments and renting apartments for prospective clients. </p><p> To add insult to injury, the girls were coerced by Alain and Claudia to visit a <em>“guru with mystical powers”</em> – a self-styled spiritual therapist – and the third person charged in the case. This character was supposed to boost their self-confidence, alleviate the stress of their situation and help them settle into their new lives. </p><p> The 500 euro that the girls were allegedly forced to spend on each session essentially went back into the pockets of the accused. </p><p> The trio apparently lived large. They rented apartments in some of the most expensive areas and streets of the French capital, always trying to avoid detection by frequently changing accommodation. </p><p> A source with the vice squad has estimated the total turnover from the business since 2010 to be around 2 million euro annually and involving a dozen young girls. He told Le Parisien that <em>“this is an extraordinary case.”</em> </p><p> Air France was also contacted for comment, but offered none at the time. </p><p> According to police, there was another, final destination to which the money was being funneled. An investigation is underway. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155560-damascus-blast-killed-syria/</guid><title><![CDATA[12 killed, 50 injured in Damascus blast - state TV]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155560-damascus-blast-killed-syria/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fa/80/00/damascus.jpg" title="Reuters / Badra Mamet "/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 08:27:47 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://img.rt.com/files/news/25/fa/80/00/damascus.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Mortar shelling of central Damascus has killed 12 people and injured at least 50, Syrian state media reported.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fa/80/00/damascus.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Badra Mamet " /> <p> The barrage of four mortar rounds hit Shaghour neighborhood of the Syrian capital, the SANA news agency said.

What's the point of the authorities handing down these sentences if they're not being put into force?</em> </p><p> <strong>Ahmed Naguib:</strong> Definitely, those pressure tactics that they have employed since June 30, 2013, those are intimidation tactics to both political dissidents at large and any voice of opposition, and specifically to the Muslim Brotherhood. We've seen in the verdict that was sentenced more than a month ago - for 529 people sentenced to death - we saw the court of appeals rescinded and revoked that sentence. Only 37 out of the 529 [were sentenced to death]. It's easy for the preliminary sentence to be so harsh because, politically, it serves as an intimidation tactic by the state towards the Muslim Brotherhood. But this definitely has not deterred the Muslim Brotherhood from continuing the protests. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The 6th of April youth movement was banned today. Why are they being targeted, do you think?</em> </p><p> <strong>AN:</strong> You have to understand that the 30th of June was not only a coup, but it was a revolution that was more or less used by the military generals and the deep state, the Mubarak regime, to become an anti-revolution movement. So now we're all being punished, one after the other, now that the Muslim Brotherhood - the largest opposition group to the Mubarak regime - has been sided away, and now the deep state is punishing one group after the other and targeting individuals who were in the front lines of the revolution from the very beginning. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The Muslim Brotherhood's leader was one of the people handed a death sentence today. Don't you think this will only mobilize pro-Morsi supporters?</em> </p><p> <strong>AN:</strong> Absolutely. If we see that, in the so-called presidential elections, General Sisi wins, escalated violence will be inevitable. On the other hand, [there will be] escalated crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and any voice of dissidence under the name or pretext of national security and war on terrorism. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Presidential elections are planned for near the end of May. Might this explain the ongoing crackdown?</em> </p><p> <strong>AN:</strong> Definitely. Not just that. You can see heightened targets of terrorism against the police. And that definitely could be explained to both tactics used by the military and intelligence community, as well as real terrorism. When you've imprisoned 20,000 people in six months, tortured 17,000, and killed 3,000, that definitely might harbor more violence. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>How do you see things panning out after the elections?</em> </p><p> AN: Not very well, because this crackdown will continue. The economic situation is very dire. The Saudi and Gulf financial support and subsidies cannot continue forever. So whomever will become Egypt's next president will be faced with a virtually impossible economic situation. And it's a country that in the past three years, has been substantially dependent on borrowing. The external debt jumped from 35 billion (Egyptian pounds) under Mubarak to over 55 billion currently. This continued borrowing only serves deficits in the budget and not income-generating activities. This means with continued political unrest, the economy will continue to suffer a major blow. Any president cannot deliver economic services to the society, which will inevitably continue the cycle of unrest and violence. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155516-nasa-star-coldest-ever/</guid><title><![CDATA[Coldest star ever found spotted by NASA infrared telescope]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155516-nasa-star-coldest-ever/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f7/c0/00/nasa-star-coldest-ever.jpg" title="WISE J085510.83-071442.5 was discovered through its rapid motion across the sky in two infrared images the WISE satellite taken six months apart in 2010.

The dwarf, officially known as WISE J085510.83-071442.5, is located 7.2 light-years away from our planet and, consequently, is the fourth-closest system from the sun. </p><p> “<em>It’s very exciting to discover a new neighbor of our solar system that is so close</em>,” Kevin Luhman, a Penn State astronomer, said in the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/nasas-spitzer-and-wise-telescopes-find-close-cold-neighbor-of-sun/#.U18UIPldVhH" target="_blank">NASA release</a>. “<em>And given its extreme temperature, it should tell us a lot about the atmospheres of planets, which often have similarly cold temperatures</em>.” </p><p> Unlike most stars, brown dwarfs do not give off enough light or heat to make them visible to the naked eye. NASA, using infrared telescope technology, was able to spot WISE J085510.83-071442.5. </p><p> Scientists eventually determined that the star’s temperature fluctuates between negative 54 degrees and 9 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it is the coldest star ever found. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Antarctica, comparatively, was minus 135.3 degrees, and the coldest temperature ever recorded in the US was minus 80 degrees on a 1971 day in Alaska. </p><p> WISE J085510.83-071442.5 is estimated to be between 3 to 10 times the mass of Jupiter. </p><p> By comparison, other brown dwarf stars discovered in the past have been approximately room temperature. </p><p> “<em>It is remarkable that even after many decades of studying the sky, we still do not have a complete inventory of the sun’s nearest neighbors</em>,” said Michael Werner, the project scientist for the Spitzer telescope at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in California. “<em>This exciting new result demonstrates the power of exploring the universe using new tools, such as the infrared eyes of WISE and Spitzer</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155500-turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult/</guid><title><![CDATA[Turkish journalist sentenced to 10 months for tweet ‘typo’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155500-turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/c0/00/turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Ozan Kose"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 02:25:22 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f6/c0/00/turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A Turkish journalist was sentenced Monday to 10 months in prison for a tweet that was critical of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a comment that he has described as a typing error.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/c0/00/turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Ozan Kose" /> <p> Önder Aytaç, a former police academy instructor who later became an influential columnist for Taraf, one of Turkey’s primary opposition newspapers, is also a member of the Gülen movement, which used to support the Erdogan government but is now against it. The tweet in question was posted in 2012 after Erdogan announced he would be closing down private schools that the Gülens operate. </p><p> Aytaç tweeted a link to a news story about the announcement with the comment: “<em>close them down my chief :-)</em>” (“ustam,” or “chief” being how Erdogan supporters refer to the prime minister). </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> <a href="http://t.co/zYBEmYiD">http://t.co/zYBEmYiD</a> =&gt; Kapat be dershaneleri Ustaaaaammmmk!.. =&gt; yorumlariniz da yazinin altina lutfen </p>— DR.

Yet average citizens were prosecuted for tweeting supportive messages when the Gezi Park protests were underway, and the Erdogan administration has a long history of trying to silence Twitter. </p><p> Aytaç received a suspended sentence, although it is not clear if his time behind bars was delayed or rendered meaningless. Because of the parameters of the law, though, the sentence he was given is not eligible to be equated into a fine or community service. </p><p> “<em>I’m quite a big man</em>,” he told the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/turkey-journalist-tweet-typo-pun/" target="_blank">Daily Dot</a>. “<em>My fingers are quite big as well.

Twitter declined to provide details about the users, although a cursory search of the two accounts – @Haramzadeler333 (which translates to “Son of Thieves”) and @Bascalan (“Prime Thief”) – proved they were indeed listed as “<em>withheld</em>.” </p><p> Erdogan previously sought to block YouTube and Twitter in March, after audio surfaced of a sensitive conversation between Turkish leaders regarding the security situation in Syria. The ban was instituted in the weeks before municipal elections. </p><p> The Twitter blackout was lifted on April 3, once the country’s highest court decided that the government rule was a direct violation of free speech. Two other rulings declared that YouTube should be unblocked for the same reason, although the video site is still unavailable to Turkish audiences. </p><p> Meanwhile Turkey’s <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-sues-gulen-linked-journalists-one-pundit-briefly-detained.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=64274&amp;NewsCatID=338" target="_blank">Hurriyet Daily News</a> reported Monday that Aytaç was briefly detained in Ankara on March 29 when government prosecutors reportedly suspected that he had been involved with leaking the audio about security in Syria, prompting the major social media crackdown.

Therefore, he told senators in a letter on April 18 the Obama administration is seeking other ways to disclose the casualty toll of their legally-dubious drone strike operations. </p><p> <em>“The executive branch is currently exploring ways in which it can provide the American people more information about the United States’ use of force outside areas of active hostilities,”</em> Clapper wrote to the top members of the Senate intelligence committee, Dianne Feinstein (D) and Saxby Chambliss (R). </p><p> <em>“To be meaningful to the public, any report including the information described above would require context and be drafted carefully so as to protect against the disclosure of intelligence sources and methods or other classified information. … We are confident we can find a reporting structure that provides the American people additional information to inform their understanding of important government operations to protect our nation, while preserving the ability to continue those operations,”</em> Clapper added. </p><p> The US government does not offer any insight into how many casualties have resulted from its covert drone-strike program that involves both Central Intelligence Agency and US Defense Department operations. Officials like Sen. Feinstein, seeking to salvage the status quo surrounding drone strikes despite deepening opposition worldwide, maintain that the number of civilian deaths from unmanned drone attacks is miniscule. </p><p> Several independent groups and journalism organizations attempt to track the number of people killed in the strikes, often using press and ground reports in the likes of Pakistan and Yemen to piece together casualty estimates. </p><p> The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, one of the most comprehensive sources for drone casualty figures, <a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/" target="_blank">estimates</a> that hundreds of civilians – at least – have perished in US drones strikes overseas. </p><p> For example, the Bureau has confirmed that drones have killed as many as 451 people in Yemen, including as many as 82 civilians. <em>"Possible"</em> – though unconfirmed – strikes have killed as many as 545 people total and as many as 45 civilians, the Bureau says. The number killed is far more in Pakistan, where an estimated 383 strikes since 2004 have killed as many as 3,718 people, and as many as 957 civilians, according to the Bureau. </p><p> Yet the US drone policy is so broad that it considers any military-age male in a strike zone as a combatant, especially if he is armed. Thus, even by the strictest standards, there are likely many more civilians who have died but were considered fighters or militants. </p><p> In addition to the high civilian casualty rates, critics say these drone strike policies are done in violation of international law, and question whether the Obama administration has the authority to sanction the killings without a court warrant. </p><p> One particular practice denounced by human rights activists is the use of so-called ‘signature strikes,’ in which a drone attack is launched based not on the identification of known Al-Qaeda fighters, but on the behavior of people. </p><p> In May 2013, amid criticism about US drone strikes overseas, President Obama said in a policy speech that <em>“before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured,”</em> adding that this is <em>“the highest possible standard.”</em> Though the latest strikes, among others, have caused <a href="http://justsecurity.org/2014/04/21/ongoing-drone-strikes-yemen-raise-questions/" target="_blank">analysts</a> to <a href="http://rt.com/usa/deadly-us-drone-strike-yemen-958/" target="_blank">question</a> whether the Obama administration’s supposed <em>“new rules”</em> for strikes are consistent at all. </p><p> The US has unofficially <a href="http://rt.com/news/pakistan-drone-strikes-taliban-657/" target="_blank">paused</a> its drone strike campaign in Pakistan, as negotiations continue between the Pakistani Taliban and the nation’s government. Yet strikes in Yemen have not stalled – nor has the official secrecy of the US that has marked its drone operations there. </p><p> Just over a week ago, <a href="http://rt.com/usa/drone-yemen-dozens-dead-880/" target="_blank">multiple</a> drone strikes in Yemen targeting so-called militants killed dozens of people, including some innocents. </p><p> In December, a US drone strike killed 15 members of a <a href="http://rt.com/news/yemen-strike-drone-wedding-161/" target="_blank">wedding</a> party, mistaking a procession of vehicles for a militant convoy. The group had been en route to the village of Qaifa, the site of the wedding, when it was hit. The assault left charred bodies strewn in the road and vehicles on fire, officials told AP. </p><p> Yemen is considered to be the top foothold for Al-Qaeda, and its affiliate there - Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) - is considered the militant network’s most active wing. The Yemeni government has asked the US for assistance in fighting terror threats, yet the entirety of negotiations between the US and Yemen is unknown. </p><p> Critics maintain that the drone strikes program in the country has done nothing to stem the growth of Al-Qaeda, and has even increased support for the terror network. </p><p> Human rights groups panned the decision to remove the transparency provision from the intelligence bill. </p><p> <em>“How many people have to die for Congress to take even a small step toward transparency? It's stunning that after all these years we still don't know how many people the Obama administration has killed with drones,”</em> said Zeke Johnson, director of Amnesty International’s security and human rights program, according to the Guardian. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155504-uk-france-baltic-jets/</guid><title><![CDATA[Britain, France deploy 8 fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155504-uk-france-baltic-jets/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f7/00/00/uk-france-baltic-jets.jpg" title="A Typhoon jet of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) (Reuters / Yiannis Nisiotis)"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 01:25:01 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f7/00/00/uk-france-baltic-jets.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />UK and France deployed eight fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland to strengthen NATO air defense over the Baltic regions amid rising tensions in Ukraine, according to officials.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f7/00/00/uk-france-baltic-jets.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A Typhoon jet of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) (Reuters / Yiannis Nisiotis)" /> <p> Out of the eight planes, four UK Typhoon jets touched down in Lithuania and another four French Rafale jets landed in Poland’s northeast town of Malbork, UK and French defense ministries stated. </p><p> The additional jets in the area are to <em>“provide reassurance to our NATO allies in eastern Europe and the Baltic states,”</em> British Defense Minister Philip Hammond said. </p><p> <em>"In the wake of recent events in Ukraine, it is right that NATO takes steps to reaffirm very publicly its commitment to the collective security of its members,"</em> Hammond added. </p><p> The Polish city of Malbork has already received 70 French military personnel to support the new planes, according to French military spokesman Colonel Gilles Jaron. </p><p> Also on Monday, the US airborne division, which is to take part in NATO exercise 'Spring Storm' in May arrived in Estonia.

Such eclipses are relatively common, with about four every five years. The last occurred in May 2013. </p><p> What makes this eclipse – the first of 2014 - unusual is that it is non-central, meaning that the center of the Moon’s shadow will not fall on Earth, instead passing above the Southern Hemisphere sky. </p><p> </p><p> Of 3,956 annular eclipses calculated to have happened or scheduled to happen between 2,000 BC and 3,000 AD only 68, or 1.7 percent, are non-central annular eclipses. This is only the third such event since the 17th century. </p><p> As most of the shadow was set to miss Earth – the perfect spot to watch the eclipse at its most symmetrical would have been above the planet . The only place where the “ring of fire”, or annulus, can be seen at all is in Antarctica. The spot is half way between the Dumont d’Urville and Concordia stations – located 1,100 km apart – meaning that in all likelihood no human was able to witness the unusual phenomenon. <br><br> "<em>This is a thoroughly bizarre eclipse,"</em> said a statement from Bob Berman, an astronomer with the Slooh Space Camera, which broadcasts astral events online. </p><p> <em><br> “As we will watch in real time as the inky black hemisphere of the moon partially obscures the sun, the greatest thrill might be an awareness of what's occurring — unseen by any human — in a tiny region of Antarctica."</em> <br><br> For sentient observers, due to the imperfect angle of observation the phenomenon wouldn't <em>"look any different from a normal, partial eclipse,"</em> Stephen Hughes told Australian Associated Press. A partial eclipse occurs when the Sun and the Moon do not fully align, so that the latter blocks out only a chunk of the former. </p><p> <br> About half the Sun was covered when the eclipse passed Sydney, and more than two thirds over Melbourne. <br><br> "<em>Melbourne will be quite a bit better than Sydney ... a super-fat banana,"</em>Hughes said before the event. <br><br> The eclipse could also be perceived in southern Indonesian islands. </p><p> NASA published an interactive <a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2014Apr29Agoogle.html"> map</a> that allowed Australasian residents to see when the eclipse passed through their area, but as usual, amateur sky-watchers were instructed to avoid looking at the Sun without protective equipment. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155472-death-row-inmate-innocent-study/</guid><title><![CDATA[1 in 25 death row inmates is likely innocent - study]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155472-death-row-inmate-innocent-study/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f5/00/00/death-row-inmate-innocent-study.jpg" title="AFP Photo / John Moore"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 23:57:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f5/00/00/death-row-inmate-innocent-study.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A new study estimated that no less than four percent of the approximately 3,000 US prisoners waiting to be put to death are in fact innocent of the crimes they committed, a shocking number that is far less than the inmates who are freed before execution.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f5/00/00/death-row-inmate-innocent-study.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / John Moore" /> <p> Researchers and legal experts from Pennsylvania, Michigan, and elsewhere around the country came together to examine the so-called “<em>dark figure</em>” that underscores the death penalty debate: how many of the people sentenced to die for their crime are actually innocent? </p><p> The result, a peer-reviewed analysis <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/04/23/1306417111" target="_blank">published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States</a>, is described as a “<em>deliberately conservative</em>” number which makes clear that wrongful convictions are not as uncommon as many would like to believe. </p><p> Legal teams determined that if all of those wrongfully convicted had their sentences cleared, the exoneration rate would jump from its current 1.6 percent to no less than 4.1 percent. By that logic, around 340 prisoners should have been released over the 30 years analyzed in the study, whereas only 138 were exonerated in that time. </p><p> “<em>This is a disturbing finding</em>,” Samuel Gross, a law professor at the University of Michigan law school and the lead author of this study, told <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent" target="_blank">the Guardian</a>. “<em>There are a large number of people who are sentenced to death, and despite our best efforts some of them have undoubtedly been executed</em>.” </p><p> The 4.1 percent is higher than previous estimates, although the researchers are confident that their method of “<em>survival analysis</em>” research was effective. The technique employs a variety of statistical devices to calculate the proportion of cases of so-called hidden innocence. To remain unbiased, they also used “<em>sensitivity analysis</em>” to determine how many exonerated convicts were in fact guilty. </p><p> “<em>If you look at the numbers in our study, at how many errors are made, then you cannot believe that we haven’t executed any innocent person – that would be wishful thinking</em>,” Smith said. </p><p> Statisticians investigating the matter were unable to accurately determine how many innocent men and women were executed, yet they took exception with a claim from US Supreme Cout Justice Antonin Scalia, who previously suggested that criminal convictions have an “error rate of 0.27% - or, to put it another way, a success rate of 99.973%.” </p><p> “<em>That would be comforting, if true</em>,” the study authors wrote. “<em>In fact, the claim is silly</em>.” </p><p> Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told journalist Ed Pilkington that “<em>every time we have an execution, there is a risk of executing an innocent person. The risk may be small, but it’s unacceptable</em>.” </p><p> Gross and his fellow academics said more prisoners than the number who were executed seem to have fallen between the cracks. In the years from 1993 to 2004 about 2,675 people were taken off death row when questions about their conviction were raised. That total represents more than one-third (36 percent) of all people sentenced to death over those three decades. </p><p> Instead of being exonerated, though, many of those thousands of people were given new sentences (more often than not life without parole) that will ensure their death behind bars anyway. Their situation is in some ways even more precarious because no longer being under threat of execution means they are no longer seen as a priority in the system, either by judges, prisoner advocate groups, or the department of corrections itself. </p><p> “<em>The best efforts of the judicial system are only devoted to prisoners when they faced execution</em>,” Gross explained. “<em>In many cases when people are released from death row, little or nothing is done to deal with the equally bad injustice they now faced – that they will spend the rest of their lives in prison for a crime they didn’t commit</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155496-tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi/</guid><title><![CDATA[TV crew evacuates LIVE on air as Mississippi tornado cuts broadcast (VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155496-tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/80/00/tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi.jpg" title="Screenshot from youtube.com @lucwise"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 23:24:53 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f6/80/00/tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />On Monday, a tornado tore through Tupelo, Mississippi in the northern part of the state at about 3 p.m., forcing staff at a local news broadcaster to seek shelter.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/80/00/tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Screenshot from youtube.com @lucwise" /> <p> WTVA in Tupelo was on the air, giving its viewers the latest information on the dangerous funnel cloud when it touched down.

Google is test-driving autonomous (or self-driving) cars on the roads around its Mountain View, Calif. headquarters. And car companies are racing to follow suit.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/c0/00/google-driverless-cars.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Justin Sullivan" /> <p> Google’s self-driving car project began in 2009 with nearly 100,000 miles of secretive testing on California highways, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=8,078,349.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8,078,349&amp;RS=PN/8,078,349"> filed for a patent</a> for <em>“transitioning a mixed-mode vehicle to autonomous mode”</em> in May 2011. At that point, Google had already been testing its fleet of driver-less Toyota Prius and Audi TT models for several years, logging 160,000 miles with limited human input and more than 1,000 miles without driver involvement, BBC News reported in 2011. </p><p> Google’s current fleet of more than two dozen Lexus hybrid SUV’s meanwhile have traveled over 7000,000 miles in self-driving mode, the Associated Press reports. </p><p> Chris Urmson, the director of the Self-Driving Car Project, says in a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-latest-chapter-for-self-driving-car.html"> blog post</a> that the project, part of the company’s <a href="http://rt.com/news/google-x-secret-lab-353/" target="_blank">secretive Google X lab</a>, has focused on the chaos of city driving over the past year. <em>“As it turns out, what looks chaotic and random on a city street to the human eye is actually fairly predictable to a computer. As we’ve encountered thousands of different situations, we’ve built software models of what to expect, from the likely (a car stopping at a red light) to the unlikely (blowing through it).</em> </p><p> <em>“We still have lots of problems to solve, including teaching the car to drive more streets in Mountain View before we tackle another town, but thousands of situations on city streets that would have stumped us two years ago can now be navigated autonomously,”</em> Urmson writes. </p><p> Four states (California, Florida, Michigan and Nevada) allow for driver-less cars, The Atlantic Cities reports. Washington, DC announced new rules at the beginning of April that would make it the first jurisdiction to license self-driving car operators (rather than testers), according to Slate. And the federal government has authorized only a handful of test locations for “connected cars,” where vehicles use technology to communicate with other similarly equipped vehicles that alert drivers to potentially dangerous situations. </p><p> <em>“One of our goals is to drive fatality rates down to zero. Last year there were over 900 people killed on Michigan roadways. If we can get cars that refuse to crash, we can save those 900 people,”</em> Kirk Steudle, director of the Michigan Department of Transportation, told <a href="http://fox17online.com/2014/02/24/michigan-leads-the-worlds-research-on-driverless-cars/#oYoJiPpJf3EoZOsP.99"> Fox 17 in West Michigan</a>. </p><p> A recent rider in one of Google’s limited demonstrations of highway road tests believes the self-driving cars are safer. <em>“After a couple minutes you forget the car is driving itself. It's smooth, patient, and cautious,”</em> the rider wrote in an e-mail to RT. <em>“It will take time to understand how self driving cars fit into our cities, on our highways, and in our homes, but from a safety perspective I think this is a huge step in the right direction</em>." </p><p> The rider believes Google is uniquely poised to develop an autonomous car. <em>“Self-driving cars aren't an automotive challenge, they’re a data and computational challenge. Google is very good at predictive behavior, which is what a self driving car needs to do in order to decide if another car (or pedestrian or biker) is going to pose a ‘threat’ to it.”</em> </p><p> The car is covered in sensors - including radar and lasers - that create 3D maps of the self-driving car’s surroundings in real time. Then Google’s software sorts that information into four categories: moving vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and static objects like signs, curbs and parked cars. The technology has advanced far enough that it can distinguish individuals in a group on a corner, construction zones and the likely movements of cyclists, Google spokeswoman Courtney Hohne told AP. </p><p> Google says its goal is to get the technology to the public by 2017, but it has not said how it will market the technology. Options include collaborating with major carmakers or giving away the software, as the company did with its Android operating system. Google co-founder Sergey Brin told the Wall Street Journal that the company plans to partner with automakers to implement the technology, rather than manufacturing its own cars. </p><p> Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota and Audi had unveiled autonomous cars by October 2013, the Consumer Electronics Association says. At the group’s annual International Consumer Electronics Show in January, BMW and Audi both unveiled their latest driverless models, complete with demonstration drives, according to CNN. Renault-Nissan’s CEO hopes to have a model on sale by 2020, AP reports. </p><p> Driverless cars are not just about providing a safer ride, however. They may also allow people who are currently physically unable to drive to be able to run errands on their own. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cdgQpa1pUUE?feature=player_embedded" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> <em>“Where this would change my life is to give me the independence and the flexibility to go both the places I want to go and need to go when I need to do those things,”</em> Steve Mahan, Google’s self-driving car user #0000000001, says in a promotional video for the company.

Iraqi soldiers and security force members were out to cast ballots Monday ahead of the general election on Wednesday. </p><p> In the western Mansour district of Baghdad, six police were killed and 16 others were wounded when a suicide attacker dressed as a police officer detonated explosives near the entrance of a school used as a polling place, according to police and medical sources. </p><p> In Adhamiya, an east-central district of Baghdad, a suicide bomber killed four soldiers and wounded seven at a polling place. </p><p> Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki is running for a third term in the election, though he faces violent opposition amid political opponents seeking to reclaim power from the Shiite-dominated government. </p><p> A leading source of aggression against the government comes from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), formerly associated with Al Qaeda before ties were severed over ISIL’s rogue actions. ISIL has fought for control over western Anbar province with their sights set on the capital, Baghdad. </p><p> ISIL has threatened other Sunnis in Iraq with death should they vote in the upcoming election. In northern Iraq, where ISIL has fought vigorously against security forces, at least 10 police officers were killed. </p><p> In Tuz Khurmatu, 55 miles (89 km) south of the northern city of Kirkuk, a suicide attacker in a police uniform killed three policemen and wounded nine near a polling station, police said. Sunni fighters have attacked the area many times, as it is home to the Shiite Turkmen minority. </p><p> In Kirkuk, another bomber in a police uniform killed six police near a voting outlet. </p><p> In Hawija, 40 miles (70 km) southwest of Kirkuk, one soldier was killed and four wounded by a suicide attacker in an army uniform near a polling center, police said. </p><p> A curfew is set to go into effect on Tuesday night before polls open for Iraqi citizens on Wednesday. </p><p> In the first three months of 2014, 1,666 civilians were killed from acts of terrorism or violence, <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1812:un-casualty-figures-for-march-2014-anbar-province-excluded&amp;Itemid=633&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">according</a> to the United Nations. The count does not include deaths among security force members. The numbers also don't count casualties in Anbar province, where accounting can be unreliable amid fierce violence and much bloodshed. That said, pending further investigation, UN sources estimate 156 civilians were killed in Anbar in March, with 741 injured. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155476-shoigu-hagel-ukraine-rhetoric/</guid><title><![CDATA[Moscow calls US, NATO military buildup near Russian borders ‘unprecedented’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155476-shoigu-hagel-ukraine-rhetoric/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f5/40/00/shoigu-hagel.jpg" title="Russia's Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu (L) and U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (R) (RIA Novosti / Reuters)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 21:58:10 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f5/40/00/shoigu-hagel.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Russia’s Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has urged his Pentagon counterpart Chuck Hagel to help cool down the rhetoric over Ukraine and described NATO troops massing near Russian borders as “unprecedented.”]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f5/40/00/shoigu-hagel.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russia's Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu (L) and U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (R) (RIA Novosti / Reuters)" /> <p> Speaking to Hagel by phone on Monday, Shoigu also denied the accusations that there are Russian agents acting in Ukraine. </p><p> <em>“The Russian minister has called for his colleague to help cool down the rhetoric [over Ukraine] as much as possible. He also unequivocally refuted baseless accusations that there are Russian sabotage and spy teams, purportedly destabilizing the situation in the south-east of the country,”</em> said a statement from the Russian defense ministry. </p><p> Instead, Shoigu classed the growth of NATO activity in Eastern Europe as “<em>unprecedented</em>”, saying it was accompanied by <em>“provocative”</em> rhetoric about <em>“containing”</em> Russia. </p><p> According to the Russian statement, Hagel expressed <em>“extreme concern”</em> about the situation in Ukraine on behalf of Brussels and Washington, and said that NATO’s actions in Europe intend to demonstrate the unity and defensive capability of the alliance, and have “<em>no provocative or expansive aims”.</em> </p><p> “<em>There is nothing new for Russia in all of this</em>,” Hagel, who assumed the role of Secretary of Defense last year, told Shoigu. </p><p> The Russian minister defended Moscow’s decision to announce military exercises near the Ukrainian border last week. </p><p> “<em>As soon as the Ukrainian authorities said that they were not going to use regular troops against unarmed civilians, Russian units were re-stationed in their usual bases,</em>” said Shoigu. </p><p> Shoigu accused Kiev of deploying more than 15,000 personnel, 80 tanks, 130 armored vehicles, and 60 artillery guns in the east of the country, “<em>under the pretext of ‘fighting terrorism’.”</em> </p><p> On Monday, NATO continued to <a href="http://rt.com/news/155504-uk-france-baltic-jets/" target="_blank">increase</a> its presence in the Baltic regions as UK and France deployed eight fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland to strengthen NATO air defense amid rising tensions in Ukraine, according to officials. </p><p> Out of the eight planes, four UK Typhoon jets touched down in Lithuania and another four French Rafale jets landed in Poland’s northeast town of Malbork, UK and French defense ministries stated. </p><p> The additional jets in the area are to <em>“provide reassurance to our NATO allies in eastern Europe and the Baltic states,”</em> British Defense Minister Philip Hammond said. <em>"In the wake of recent events in Ukraine, it is right that NATO takes steps to reaffirm very publicly its commitment to the collective security of its members,"</em> he added. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155484-tupelo-mississippi-tornado-large-damage/</guid><title><![CDATA[Large tornadoes sweep across Mississippi causing deaths and major damage]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155484-tupelo-mississippi-tornado-large-damage/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f5/c0/00/tornado.jpg" title="A U.S. flag sticks out the window of a damaged hot rod car in a suburban area after a tornado near Vilonia, Arkansas April 28, 2014.

The possibility of Russia exporting 500 megawatts of electricity to Iran is also on the cards, said Mehr. <br><br> The strengthening of economic ties between the two countries is of heightened significance given both economic sanctions on Iran, imposed with the aim of encouraging Iran to cut its uranium stockpiles, and new economic sanctions on Russian officials imposed on Monday. <br><br> On Sunday, Chitchian reportedly stressed <em>“the need for further expansion of economic ties between Tehran and Moscow, particularly in the energy and commerce spheres</em>,” stated Mehr. <br><br> Moscow has additionally been discussing the trade of 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil for Russian goods with Tehran. The protracted deal, first reported at the beginning of April could be worth as much as $20 billion, and has rattled Washington because it could bring Iran's crude exports above one million barrels a day - the threshold agreed upon in the nuclear deal between the P5+1 powers - US, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany – and Iran. <br><br> Moscow and Tehran are far from finalizing the contract, according to Russian business daily Kommersant, which first broke the news. Nonetheless, the Obama administration has expressed distaste at the reports. <br><br> Tehran’s ambassador to Moscow Mehdi Sanaei said on Friday that the implementation of Iran-Russia energy agreements hold the key to economic expansion. <br><br> Sanaei underlined the importance of promoting of Iran-Russia cooperation and called for the implementation of oil, gas and electricity deals, according to Press TV. <br><br> Russia-Iran trade is currently worth $5 billion a year, but economists say the two countries can at least quadruple the volume of trade. </p><p> Earlier this month, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said the Islamic Republic is determined to raise the volume of its “<em>economic transactions”</em> with Russia. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155460-us-intel-officers-iraq/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pentagon quietly sends more intelligence officers to Iraq]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155460-us-intel-officers-iraq/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/40/00/us-quietly-sends-more-intelligence-officers-to-iraq.jpg" title="AFP Photo / US Army"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 20:21:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f4/40/00/us-quietly-sends-more-intelligence-officers-to-iraq.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The United States is reportedly increasing the number of intelligence officers deployed to Iraq amidst new waves of violence there being attributed to jihadists from the group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/40/00/us-quietly-sends-more-intelligence-officers-to-iraq.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / US Army" /> <p> On Friday, Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/25/us-usa-iraq-security-idUSBREA3O1YZ20140425" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Pentagon has sent an entire team of high-level American intelligence agents abroad in order to investigate reports of growing insurgency, citing two current and one former US officials familiar with the matter. </p><p> The officials, Reuters claimed, believe the ISIL “<em>now boasts territorial influence stretching from Iraq's western Anbar province to northern Syria.”</em> </p><p> An Al-Qaeda offshoot, the ISIL has for years been working towards imposing Sharia law in the parts of Iraq that are typically Sunni-majority regions. In recent days, however, those efforts have been linked to grave acts of violence that have killed dozens just over the weekend. </p><p> By Saturday, the Associated Press had <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/suicide-attack-iraq-kills-least-11-people-093405645.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that the ISIL was claiming responsibility for a bombing one day earlier that left no fewer than six people dead. The following day, ISIL was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/suicide-attack-iraq-kills-least-11-people-093405645.html" target="_blank">attributed</a> with taking the lives of 33 after an attack was waged at a political rally for a hardline Shiite group known as Asaib Ahl Al-Haq. </p><p> <em>"The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant considers the Asaib Ahl al-Haq as its enemy and that's an honor for us,"</em> the leader of the Shiite group — Qais Al-Khazali— said at a news conference, according to the AP. <em>"Our blood will not have been shed in vain and what happened will not go unpunished."</em> </p><p> But as Iraq prepares for its first elections next week since the withdrawal of American troops in 2011, further violence is likely to be seen in the coming days — once again calling into question the effectiveness of the lengthy US-led military mission there that was touted as spreading democracy, not disruptions. </p><p> According to Reuters, around 100 US military personnel have remained in Iraq since the formal exit two years ago, but now an unknown number of intel agents have been deployed there to try and determine what could arise next if fighting between groups continues. </p><p> Government sources who spoke of the deployment to Reuters declined to be identified, and a spokesperson for the White House did not respond to the agency’s requests for comment. One source told Reuters that senior US policy officials met in Washington, DC last week to discuss further action in the region, but was not sure of the outcome of the meeting. </p><p> In a separate report published over the weekend, AP journalists wrote that the United Nations believes fighting in Iraq last year claimed some 8,868 people — a tally that hasn’t been seen since the height of the US-fought war there that ended in 2011. According to the UN, more than 1,400 people have been killed in Iraq during the first two months of 2014, and violence has only intensified in recent weeks. </p><p> Ned Parker — Reuters’ Baghdad bureau chief — told National Public Radio over the weekend that the latest events are likely only a sampling of what could be seen in Iraq next. </p><p> <em>“Iraqis are anticipating violence. What happened on Friday, the bombing at the Asaib Ahl Al-Haw political rally, was really a warning, an omen of what could happen. The government has declared a week holiday for the elections and there will be a curfew.

(Reuters/Neil Hall)" /> <p> Councils that have been picked out as responsible for potential fracking areas have assets in firms by way of their pension funds, according to the report <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-local-authorities-have-conflict-of-interest-on-fracking-investments-9294590.html" target="_blank">published</a> late on Sunday. </p><p> <br> The newspaper pointed out that Lincolnshire County Council’s pension fund has 1.9 million pounds ($3.2 million) invested in French company, Total. Total was the first major oil company to make incursions into Britain with the intention of seeking shale gas profit. <br><br> The company has a 30 million pound ($50 million) holding in two exploration ventures in the northeastern county. <br><br> West Sussex County Council has some indirect investments in both Cuadrilla and3.5 million pounds in Centrica. The southern county was the site of ongoing protests in Balcombe last summer, which residents reported ‘scarred’ and ‘divided’ the village’s inhabitants after considerable opposition erupted when Cuadrilla announced proposals to drill in the county. <br><br> The council stated that its investment equated to some 0.001 percent of the total value of its £2.45bn pension fund. <em>“Any indirect investments made by the pension fund’s investment managers would not have any influence at all in determining a planning application,”</em> the council said in a statement to the paper. <br><br> Last Wednesday, Cuadrilla Resources said that it is continuing to consult with residents on proposals for two shale gas exploration sites in the Fylde area of Lancashire in northwest England. <br><br> The Greater Manchester Pension Fund (GMPF) invests on behalf of Salford and Trafford councils. The area is being tested currently for shale gas by a company named IGas. The IGas group was invested in by the Henderson group, which itself has GMPF as a shareholder. <br><br> Each body contacted by the paper maintained that the investments did not constitute a conflict of interest. However, environmental activists have voiced outrage. <br><br><em>“It’s a worrying discovery. Fracking is already a dirty enough industry without getting mired in the murky waters of conflicts of interest. Councils must disinvest and show local voters that they can be trusted to put the interests of their constituents first when making crucial decisions on fracking applications,”</em> Simon Clydesdale, energy campaigner for Greenpeace UK, told the Independent. <br><br> Lincolnshire’s assistant director of resources, David Forbes, stated: <em>“The pension scheme operates within a set of clear investment principles and is overseen by the pension committee, which makes its decisions independently from the county council.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155416-uk-barclays-libor-probe/</guid><title><![CDATA[US-based ex-Barclays staff charged by UK in Libor scandal]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155416-uk-barclays-libor-probe/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f1/80/00/uk-barclays-libor-probe.jpg" title="Reuters/Toby Melville"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:24:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f1/80/00/uk-barclays-libor-probe.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK filed its first criminal proceedings against scandal-struck US-based Libor traders on Monday over the alleged rigging of global benchmark interest rates.

The lawyers for the remaining two men were not available for comment, reported Reuters. <br><br> While the SFO confirmed that the trio are in the US, they are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court in London on May 27. The occasion could set the ball rolling for the first extradition to the UK from the US in what has been a lengthy investigation into Libor (London interbank offered rate) manipulation. <br><br> The Libor scandal dates back to 2005. Libor is the average interest rate that underpins trillions of dollars worth of loans, contracts and mortgages through the interest rates of major London banks. The scandal drew in some of the world’s biggest financial institutions, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, and Barclays. <br><br> Barclays was the first bank to settle in the wake of the rate manipulation accusations, paying some $450 million in fines in 2012 after admitting misconduct. <br><br> The subsequent backlash forced out four top Barclays directors, including chief executive Bob Diamond in 2012, who had previously insisted that he would not resign. <br><br> So far, US and European authorities have fined 10 banks and brokerages a total of $6 billion. <br><br> Twelve people are now facing criminal charges in the US and UK, among them the three from Barclays for the manipulation of denominated Libor. Twenty-two potential co-conspirators have also been identified, but not publicly named. <br><br> The charges fall at a time when a parallel investigation is underway into foreign exchange market rigging. On March 5, the Bank of England was forced to suspend a member of staff. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155452-russia-ukraine-political-repressions/</guid><title><![CDATA[Moscow slams Kiev over 'political repressions']]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155452-russia-ukraine-political-repressions/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/c0/00/1russia-ukraine-political-prisoners.jpg" title="Anti-Kiev activists hold Russian flags and shout slogans during a rally outside a regional television station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on April 27, 2014 (AFP Photo / Alexander Khudoteply)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:24:45 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f3/c0/00/1russia-ukraine-political-prisoners.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Moscow is “extremely concerned” by the Kiev regime’s “political repression and persecution” against those who dare express opposition, the Russian Foreign Ministry said calling for the release all political prisoners.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/c0/00/1russia-ukraine-political-prisoners.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Anti-Kiev activists hold Russian flags and shout slogans during a rally outside a regional television station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on April 27, 2014 (AFP Photo / Alexander Khudoteply)" /> <p> <em>“Mass media reports give us reason to speak of the start of a ‘witch hunt’, mass prosecution of dissidents and political repressions and persecutions against those who dare disagree with the Maidan [coup-imposed] authorities,”</em> Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. </p><p> It particularly recalled the case of recently arrested “people’s governor” of Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev. </p><p> <em>“We are seriously concerned about the condition of Pavel Gubarev elected ‘a people’s governor’ of Donetsk,”</em> the ministry said, adding that he was abducted, charged with organizing mass unrests and attempting to divide Ukraine, and tortured. He went on <a href="http://rt.com/news/154872-gubarev-protest-ukraine-slavyansk/" target="_blank">hunger strike</a> against Kiev’s crackdown on protesters in Slavyansk, eastern Ukraine. </p><p> According to the Ministry, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Red Cross, managed to get access to Gubarev and visit him in prison on April 26, following “insistent calls” by Russia. The organizations confirmed the abovementioned situation. </p><p> <em>“Pavel Gubarev is not the only political prisoner of the Kiev regime,”</em> the statement stressed. </p><p> Citing local mass media, the Ministry also said that Moscow is seriously worried by reports about the construction of large temporary detention centers for thousands of people in Ukraine, allegedly for illegal migrants. </p><p> <em>“There is no such large number of illegal migrants in Ukraine, and buildings that are being erected, according to media reports, are very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps.

On their way, Sharlene Simon, 42, struck all three of the boys with her SUV. Majewski was severely injured, and died just two hours later. </p><p> Majewski’s father, Derek Majewski, acknowledged to the Toronto Sun that the boys shouldn’t have been out so late – it was past 1 a.m. at the time of the collision – but said they are <em>“good kids”</em> and should not have been hit by the vehicle. Now that the woman behind the vehicle is suing his dead son for emotional issues, anxiety, and trauma, he was not shy about expressing his anger. </p><p> <em>“I feel like someone kicked me in the stomach — I’m over the edge,”</em> the dead boy’s father, Derek Majewski, said to the Toronto Sun. <em>“Sometimes, it makes my blood boil.”</em> </p><p> The family’s attorney, Brian Cameron, expressed similar shock over receiving news of the lawsuit. </p><p> <em>"In my 14 years of doing this, I've unfortunately represented far too many people who have lost children being hit by motorists, (and) I've never seen this,"</em> Cameron told Toronto’s CTV News Channel. <em>"I've never even heard of this … I was shocked when I got the claim."</em> </p><p> According to the lawsuit, Simon pins the blame for the accident on the teenagers themselves, with the suit stating, <em>“They did not apply their brakes properly. They were incompetent bicyclists.”</em> </p><p> Simon’s lawyer, Michael Ellis, argued his client has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder due to the incident and suffers from headaches, anxiety, depression, and emotional discomfort. Simon is suing seeking $1.3 million in damages for her <em>“great pain and suffering.”</em> </p><p> <em>"She relives the terror of this incident every day. Ms. Simon has been unable to return to work since the collision. She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She is also a victim,"</em> Ellis said, according to CTV News. </p><p> As noted by the Sun, however, the police report describing the incident shows that Simon admitted to speeding when the accident occurred. She was driving 90 km/hr in an 80 km/hr zone, and said she did not see the teenagers or the orange-red reflectors on their bikes. </p><p> Simon was being followed in a separate car by her husband, a York Regional police officer, and did not undergo a breathalyzer test, since police did not believe she was driving under the influence. Simon’s husband drove her home after the accident and no charges were filed. </p><p> The family, however, claims Simon may have been drinking and possibly on the phone when she struck the teenagers, in addition to speeding. The family had previously filed a suit seeking $900,000 in damages related to <em>“emotional trauma and shock.”</em> </p><p> <em>“I’m devastated, I’m in shock,”</em> Brandon’s mother, Venetta Mylnczyk, said to the Sun. <em>“She killed my child and now she wants to profit from it? She says she’s in pain? Tell her to look inside my head and she will see pain, she will see panic, she will see nightmares.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155312-rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[US sanctions won't undermine Russian economy]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155312-rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/00/00/rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us.jpg" title="Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin (RIA Novosti/Aleksey Nikolskyi)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 18:46:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/eb/00/00/rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The third round of US sanctions do not heavily target Russia's key industries, but include asset freezes against 17 companies and 7 individuals, including Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/00/00/rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin (RIA Novosti/Aleksey Nikolskyi)" /> <p> All companies on the <a href="http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/" target="_blank">fresh round of sanctions</a> are owned by Gennady Timchenko, <a href="http://rt.com/business/154228-rotenberg-pipe-sales-gazprom/" target="_blank">Arkady and Boris Rotenberg</a>, or <a href="http://rt.com/business/rossiya-bank-sanctions-ruble-913/" target="_blank">Bank Rossiya</a>, which were targets of the second round, the US Treasury Department said in a <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2369.aspx" target="_blank">statement</a> on their website on Monday, April 28. </p><p> <em>"Companies have been designated on the Entity List based on a determination they are involved, or pose a significant risk of becoming involved, in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,"</em> the US Office of Congressional and Public Affairs said in a press release. </p><p> The banks sanctioned are SMP Bank, Russia's 36th largest by assets, Sobinbank, the country's 90th largest bank, and Investkapitalbank, number 197. </p><p> Arkady Rotenberg's bank, SMP, was <em>"ready"</em> for the sanctions, according to a bank spokesperson, who said the lending institution had already taken a number of precautions to minimize any sanction-related damage to customers. </p><p> Following the announcement of sanctions, US-based payment system MasterCard suspended its services to two Russian banks, targeted SMP and Investcapitalbank. This brings the number of Russian banks that the system has stopped working with to four. In March, MasterCard <a href="http://rt.com/business/visa-mastercard-russia-sanctions-285/" target="_blank">suspended</a><a href="http://rt.com/business/visa-mastercard-russia-sanctions-285/" target="_blank"></a> work with Sobinbank and Bank Rossiya, but then <a href="http://rt.com/business/visa-mastercard-us-sanctions-693/" target="_blank">resumed</a> services shortly. International payment systems Visa and MasterCard already halted services with both SMP and Investcapitalbank in March. </p><p> No publicly-listed Russian companies were included on the new sanction list, but Obama said that the US and its allies would keep broader sanctions <em>“in reserve”</em> in the event of further escalation on the ground in Ukraine. Before, US politicians <a href="http://rt.com/business/gazprom-bank-us-sanctions-768/" target="_blank">called</a> for sanctions against Russia's finance and energy sectors. </p><p> <iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/220707581/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-ivyrrsus57hz0qc8m26&amp;show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.706896551724138" id="doc_25985" name="doc_25985" frameborder="0" height="800" scrolling="no" width="600"><br></iframe> </p><h2> Sechin, Sanctioned </h2><p> Igor Sechin, the head of Russia’s biggest oil company Rosneft, is a prominent Russian businessman singled out by the US. Former Board of Director, Sergey Chemezov, was also placed under sanctioned. Chemezov is the current CEO of state-owned hi-tech holding company Rostec. </p><p> Sanctions, however, do not affect Russia’s state-owned Rosneft. </p><p> Commenting on the newly imposed sanctions, Sechin linked the measure to Rosneft’s activity and considered it as <em>“an appreciation”</em> of the company’s <em>“efficiency”.</em> </p><p> <em>“We understand that the American administration noticed the company’s active actions aimed at minimizing the risks, linked with the unilateral orientation of hydrocarbons exports to concrete regional markets,"</em> Rosneft's press office cited Sechin as saying in a statement. <em>"I take the last steps by Washington as an appreciation of the efficiency of our work."</em> </p><p> He assured Rosneft’s shareholders that the US measures against him would not affect the company’s effectiveness and stressed that the oil producer will continue cooperation with American partners. </p><p> Despite the sanctions, US oil giant ExxonMobil and Rosneft will continue to develop hydrocarbon reserves in the arctic waters of Russia. On Monday, Rosneft approved the development of two oil fields jointly with ExxonMobil at a board meeting, the company said in a statement. </p><p> Rosneft shares in Moscow fell 1.56 percent at 18:30 local Moscow time. The total market capitalization of the company is $64.7 billion. BP shares were down 1.3 percent. </p><p> By personally going after Sechin, the US has sent a message that the next round of sanctions could hit the heart of the Russian economy- the energy sector. </p><h2> BP and 'Big Oil' </h2><p> When Sechin was rumored to be on a previous EU sanction list, a spokesperson <a href="http://rt.com/business/eu-sanctions-sechin-rosneft-906/">said</a> the move was <em>"stupid"</em> and would <em>"sabotage"</em> the West, which has very tight-knit relations with 'Big Oil' companies based in the UK and US. </p><p> Rosneft is the world’s largest-listed oil company, and British Petroleum (BP) has a 19.75 percent stake, making it the biggest foreign investor in Russia's oil sector. </p><p> BP, Europe's second-largest oil company is based in the UK, but over 40 percent of assets are located in the US.BP CEO Bob Dudley has told shareholders the company remains positive about <a href="http://rt.com/business/business-usual-bp-russia-896/">business with Russia</a>. </p><p> <em>"We are considering today's announcement to see specifically what this may mean for BP,"</em> a spokesman for BP in London said, adding the company would comply with any <em>"relevant"</em> sanctions. </p><p> <em>"We are committed to our investment in Rosneft, and we intend to remain a successful, long term investor in Russia,"</em> the spokesman said. </p><p> Other individuals on the list are politicians, including Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak and Aleksey Pushkov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs. </p><p> Individuals on the new list will have their assets frozen and be denied visas to travel to the US. </p><h2> America's 'Cold War Mentality' </h2><p> Previously, the <a href="http://rt.com/news/eu-sanctions-russia-ukraine-197/">EU</a> and <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ukraine-us-russia-sanctions-129/">US</a> blacklisted dozens of Russian politicians and businessmen, freezing assets and issuing travel bans. The US also imposed sanctions on Russia’s 14th largest lender, Bank Rossiya. </p><p> The US Treasury Department's statement said the new sanctions were motivated by Russia's failure to deescalate violence in neighboring Ukraine. </p><p> Moscow maintains that further economic sanctions against Russia simply fuel the revival of a Cold War mentality and are counter-productive. Russian President Vladimir Putin has <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-west-oil-prices-136/">said</a> that Western efforts to disrupt Russia's influence over the world energy market will backfire and hurt the US. </p><p> The EU has so far not introduced a third stage of sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, as there is little consensus among member states. </p><p> On April 17, leaders from Russia, Ukraine, EU, and the US <a href="http://rt.com/news/geneva-document-ukraine-deescalation-224/" target="_blank">agreed</a> a peace plan for Ukraine in Geneva, Switzerland. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155448-microsoft-internet-explorer-0day/</guid><title><![CDATA[Internet Explorer users risk having their computers taken over]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155448-microsoft-internet-explorer-0day/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/80/00/major-security-flaw-hits-internet-explorer.jpg" title="Internet Explorer logo"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 18:45:16 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f3/80/00/major-security-flaw-hits-internet-explorer.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​A major security flaw affecting several versions of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer web browser was discovered over the weekend, and the percentage of computer users that could be compromised by the exploit is absolutely staggering.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/80/00/major-security-flaw-hits-internet-explorer.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Internet Explorer logo" /> <p> Bill Gates’ Microsoft Corp. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/security/2963983" target="_blank">announced</a> on Saturday that Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11 are all vulnerable to a glitch that when properly exploited can give hackers remote access to a victim’s computer. </p><p> When combined, versions nine through 11 of the browser accounted for 26.25 percent of all web traffic in 2013, security firm <a href="http://www.fireeye.com/blog/?p=5312" target="_blank">FireEye</a> claimed over the weekend. If all vulnerable versions are accounted for, however, then upwards of <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpcustomd=0&amp;qpsp=168&amp;qpnp=12&amp;qptimeframe=M" target="_blank">56 percent</a> of the browsers currently in use around the world are reportedly in danger of being exploited. </p><p> A person with knowledge of the vulnerability may create a fake website that, when visited, allows the hacker to exploit the bug and break into their target’s machine, Microsoft warned. </p><p> <em>"An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights,"</em> the company advised. </p><p> According to FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza, hackers had already taken advantage of the exploit by targeting unnamed US-based firms that are tied to the defense and financial sectors. </p><p> <em>"It's unclear what the motives of this attack group are, at this point,</em>” De Souza told Reuters on Sunday. <em>"It appears to be broad-spectrum intel gathering."</em> </p><p> On the official FireEye blog, security experts said that the hacking campaign has been dubbed “Operation Clandestine Fox,” and is consistent with other attacks linked to an advanced persistent threat group that has previously attracted the attention of investigators. </p><p> The unknown APT group has had access to "<em>a select number of browser-based 0-day exploits in the past</em>,” FireEye stated, but declined to publish further details. </p><p> Microsoft was unable to patch the vulnerability by the time the weekend was over, and the United States government’s Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) issued an <a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2014/04/28/Microsoft-Internet-Explorer-Use-After-Free-Vulnerability-Being" target="_blank">alert</a> warning computer users to “<em>consider employing an alternative web browser</em>.” </p><p> <em>"We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem,</em>" Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute warned in an advisory of its own. </p><p> Additionally, news of the vulnerability surfaced only weeks after Microsoft officially retired from offering security patches to its highly popular XP operating system. </p><p> <em>"XP users are not safe anymore and this is the first vulnerability that will be not patched for their system,"</em> Symantec researcher Christian Tripputi warned. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155380-ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings/</guid><title><![CDATA[Anti-Kiev protesters barricade City Hall in eastern Ukraine (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155380-ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ef/40/00/ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings.jpg" title="Pro-federalization supporters and city residents make barricades using concrete blocks near the city council  building in Konstantinovka in Donetsk Region (RIA Novosti / Mikhail Voskresensky)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 17:48:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ef/40/00/ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Anti-government protesters have seized administrative buildings, including the City Hall and prosecutor’s office in yet another city in Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine.

According to RT’s Paula Slier working at the scene, the mood there was <em>“jovial despite armed guns at the entrance”</em> and the crowd was clapping welcoming the move. </p><p> Some of the protesters with St. George ribbons drove trucks with concrete blocks and a construction crane to the administrative building, preparing to fortify barricades. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wxoXXItQAr4" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> Prior to that anti-government protesters blocked the entrance with sand bags and tires. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> People watching the crane at work <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Konstantinovka&amp;src=hash">#Konstantinovka</a><a href="http://t.co/ydUUG84qO6">pic.twitter.com/ydUUG84qO6</a> </p> <p> — PaulaSlier_RT (@PaulaSlier_RT) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulaSlier_RT/statuses/460729879034888192"> April 28, 2014 <br></a> </p> </blockquote><p> RT’s correspondent also saw a truck bringing a heap of sand and dumping it in front of the building. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Fortifying the barrier in front of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Konstantinovka&amp;src=hash">#Konstantinovka</a> regional govt building <a href="http://t.co/3kmmpu4c6r">pic.twitter.com/3kmmpu4c6r</a> </p> <p> — PaulaSlier_RT (@PaulaSlier_RT) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulaSlier_RT/statuses/460702841435590656"> April 28, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> As the time passed, anti-government protesters still did not voice any demands.

The photo has already been favorited by more than 14,100 people and retweeted by nearly 30,000. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> My selfie with President Obama ! <a href="http://t.co/mr94wZtmuA">pic.twitter.com/mr94wZtmuA</a> </p>— Mohd Najib Tun Razak (@NajibRazak) <a href="https://twitter.com/NajibRazak/statuses/460289899791253504">April 27, 2014</a> </blockquote><p> As noted by Time Magazine, the selfie’s emergence is a little awkward, since it came just days after Obama denied a similar request by a 13-year-old girl after speaking to US troops in South Korea. The young girl was holding a sign that read, “Mr. President may I have a selfie with you?” but Obama reportedly told the young lady that if he took a photo with her he’d have to do so with everyone else. </p><p> Regardless, some of the president’s critics just want the whole selfie-taking craze to stop completely. After the Obama/Razak photo exploded onto the internet, Fox News host Greta Van Susteran responded on Twitter asking, <em>“how much longer are ‘selfies’ going to be the fad?”</em> </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> how much longer are 'selfies' going to be the fad? </p>— Greta Van Susteren (@gretawire) <a href="https://twitter.com/gretawire/statuses/460415635588407296">April 27, 2014</a> </blockquote><p> Of course, this isn’t the first time President Obama has indulged people – or world leaders, for that matter – when it comes to the fine art of selfie-taking. At last year’s memorial service for the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, Obama was caught taking a selfie with British Prime Minster David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. As RT <a href="http://rt.com/news/obama-selfie-mandela-service-017/" target="_blank">reported</a> then, some criticized the leaders for their decision to take the photo during a funeral service. </p><p> </p><p> Meanwhile, Obama’s participation in selfies was further called into question in early April, when baseball player David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox tweeted a photo taken with the president at a White House visit. It was later revealed that the entire stunt was organized by Ortiz and smartphone maker Samsung, leading some in the administration to wonder if Obama would take any more selfies moving forward. </p><p> </p><p> <em>"As a rule the White House objects to attempts to use the president's likeness for commercial purposes, and we certainly object in this case,"</em> White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said at the time. </p><p> Just two weeks ago, though, Obama appeared in one more selfie, this time with Vice President Joe Biden, who also posted the photo online. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155428-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/</guid><title><![CDATA[US military expands presence in Philippines despite constitutional ban]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155428-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f2/40/00/us_military.jpg" title="U.S marines look for their tents as they arrive at Crow Valley for the Philippines-U.S. amphibious landing exercise dubbed Phiblex 2013 in Tarlac, north of Manila, October 9, 2012.

(Reuters)" /> <p> US President Barack Obama inked his name to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement on Monday in Manila as he wrapped up a weeklong tour of the region that included stops in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. </p><p> But amidst allegations that the US is entering the pact with Philippines just to keep a watchful eye on China’s military, Pres. Obama said the agreement is intended to help uphold international law, even perhaps with the help of the Chinese. </p><p> <em>"Our goal is not to counter China. Our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make sure international rules and norms are respected and that includes in the area of international disputes,"</em> Obama said at a news conference with Philippine President Benigno Aquino III at the Malacanang Palace in Manila, according to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/28/obama-visits-philippines_n_5224504.html" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>. </p><p> According to the AP, Pres. Aquino said the deal <em>"takes our security cooperation to a higher level of engagement, reaffirms our countries' commitment to mutual defense and security and promotes regional peace and stability."</em> </p><p> <em>“The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement serves as recognition that there is even more we can do together to support the alliance and promote peace and security in the region,”</em> added US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip S. Goldberg, according to the state-run <a href="http://news.pia.gov.ph/index.php?article=241398679339" target="_blank">Philippine Information Agency</a>. </p><p> Nevertheless, critics have suggested that the agreement is only authorizing the US to expand its influence in the region and turn the heat up on China in the midst of a <a href="http://rt.com/usa/biden-china-abe-airspace-658/" target="_blank">territory dispute</a> between Beijing officials and America’s Japanese allies concerning islands in the South China Sea. </p><p> On Monday, the Philippines’ <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/597859/what-is-the-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement-and-what-does-it-mean-for-ph" target="_blank">Inquirer</a> news outlet write that militant groups in the area are protesting the agreement because they believe it violates the local constitution on account of how it authorizes US troops to make use of island bases. Some opponents, the Inquirer added, also believe that negotiations were fast-tracked in order to be ready in time for Pres. Obama’s arrival this week. </p><p> Indeed, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement does contain rules for how the US can use military bases in the Philippines for the next ten years. At the same time, however, a provision in the contract explicitly acknowledged that the US <em>“[cannot] establish military presence or base in the Philippines”</em> by entering the agreement. Instead, local facilities will remain under control of the Philippine military, but US forces will be routinely rotated in to participate in joint training exercises. </p><p> <em>“The Philippine Constitution bars permanent US military bases, although hundreds of American military personnel have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002 to provide counterterrorism training to Filipino soldiers fighting Muslim militants,”</em> the AP acknowledged on Monday. </p><p> Other provisions of the agreement require the US to get prior consent from the Philippines before using agreed upon locations, which will remain the primary responsibility of the local government. If officials allow the US to construct and buildings or ownership during the ten-year tenure, then those facilities will also become property of the Philippines, the agreement also proclaims. </p><p> Plans to establish what bases the US will be allowed access to under the deal have yet to be revealed, but the AP speculated that a former US facility at Subic Bay could be re-opened. According to <a href="http://rt.com/news/155192-us-philippines-security-pact/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, a military source believes the US will gradually deploy combat ships, a squadron of F18s or F16s and maritime surveillance aircraft to the Philippines now that the deal has been authorized. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155392-dyncorp-afghan-reconstruction-contract/</guid><title><![CDATA[DynCorp-gate: How State Dept. wasted billions on Afghan reconstruction]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155392-dyncorp-afghan-reconstruction-contract/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f0/00/00/dyncorp.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Massoud Hossaini"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 16:25:56 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f0/00/00/dyncorp.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Department of State has spent billions on Afghan reconstruction since America’s longest-running war began there over a decade ago, but a new report reveals that the majority of that money went to a single contractor with a sordid past.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f0/00/00/dyncorp.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Massoud Hossaini" /> <p> According to that recently released <a href="http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/special%20projects/SIGAR-14-49-SP.pdf" target="_blank">write-up</a>, the United States gave $2.7 billion to Virginia-based military contractor DynCorp between 2002 and March 2013, even as the embattled firm was being berated by bad publicity brought on by a handful of scandals and mishaps. </p><p> In 2007, for example, a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR) report determined that “<em>DynCorp seemed to act almost independently of its reporting officers at the Department of State</em>,” and had billed the US government for millions of dollars for unauthorized work. In 2011, the company agreed to settle the dispute by signing a check to the State Dept. for $7.7 million, but that same year the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks published a <a href="http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/06/09KABUL1651.html" target="_blank">diplomatic cable</a> that further attracted negative attention to DynCorp by revealing that contractors hired an underage Afghan boy to entertain them. Nevertheless, DynCorp continued to take in billions from the State Dept. for contract work in both Afghanistan and <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-iraq-billion-spending-500/" target="_blank">Iraq</a>. </p><p> The latest SIGAR report — published on Thursday last week — reveals that, despite this reputation, DynCorp managed to rake in more money from the State Dept. than any other contractor. As the US prepares to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan, however, DynCorp’s efficiency is being called into question. </p><p> Of the roughly $4 billion spent by the State Dept. between 2002 and March 2013, the US awarded 1,874 contracts, grants and cooperative agreements to 771 organizations and individuals, according to the report. Of that chunk, about $3.5 billion — or 87 percent — went to supporting large, so-called "rule-of-law" projects — and almost all of that ended up being awarded to DynCorp. </p><p> The $2.7 billion in government contracts — $2,751,391,412.62, to be exact — that was awarded to DynCorp during that 11-year duration was for the primary purpose of “police development,” according to last week’s report. And as the SIGAR’s summary indicates, the sheer amount of money awarded to DynCorp far exceeds every other State Dept. contract. </p><p> <em>“The top recipient of State reconstruction funding by total awards was Dyncorp International Limited Liability Corporation (Dyncorp),”</em> the SIGAR report reads<em>. “Dyncorp received approximately $2.8 billion in contracts, accounting for 69 percent of total State Department reconstruction awards.”</em> The firm that received the second-most money from the State Dept. through contractors was PAE Government Services Incorporated at $597.8 million — or about one-fourth of what DynCorp received. The next company on the list was awarded only one-tenth of that. </p><p> But were the billions dished out for law enforcement operations in Afghanistan even worth it? The latest SIGAR report notes that <em>“Dyncorp contracts dealt principally with training and equipping the Afghan National Police and counternarcotics forces,”</em> and <em>“included police trainers, construction of police infrastructure and fielding police equipment and vehicles.</em>” Last November it was reported that Afghan opium production has only <a href="http://rt.com/news/afghanistan-opium-un-warlords-657/" target="_blank">surged</a>, and just last week three American civilians were killed as the result of an attack in Kabul. According to the <a href="http://icasualties.org/oef/" target="_blank">iCasualties.org</a> website, 16 US troops have died so far this year in Afghanistan. </p><p> Neil Gordon, an investigator with the DC-based Project on Government Oversight transparency group, asked in an <a href="http://www.pogo.org/blog/2014/04/20140424-meet-the-3-largest-recipients-of-state-dept-afghan-aid.html" target="_blank">article</a> published last week if it made sense to but a firm with such a “colorful past” at the helm of reconstruction efforts. DynCorp, Gordon wrote, has previously been linked to “instances of <em>labor smuggling</em>,<em>weak performance and over payments</em> on a base support services contract,<em>botched construction work</em> on an Afghan Army garrison and <em>lawsuits filed by disgruntled subcontractors</em>.” Nevertheless, they’ve remained the State Department’s go-to guys when it comes to Afghan contracts. </p><p> State Dept. whistleblower Peter Van Buren <a href="http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2014/04/28/state-department-gives-87-of-afghan-funds-to-only-five-recipients/" target="_blank">wrote</a> for Firedoglake this week that he thinks these massive contractors several implications, in his opinion. </p><p> <em>“The smallest issue seems to be the massive hemorrhaging of money into just one corporate pocket. Given the amounts, one looks forward to future SIGAR reporting about how this came to be. How many non-competed contracts? How many insider deals? How much unaccounted for money? The appearance of corruption, as well as the opportunities for corruption, are evident,”</em> Van Buren wrote. </p><p> <em>“The next issue of course is what, if anything, was accomplished with all that taxpayer money absent enriching a few large corporations. Pick your trend line, and it is hard to find much bang for the buck(s) in Afghanistan,”</em> he added. </p><p> Van Buren isn’t the only one that has raised objections recently about US money in Afghanistan, either: earlier this month, a letter from SIGAR's general counsel accused the US Agency for International Developmentof having “<em>covered up information</em>” that showed that the Afghan government has been largely unable to account for cash or resources provided through US support endeavors. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155424-donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters/</guid><title><![CDATA[Blasts, fierce fighting in Donetsk between pro- and anti-Kiev demos (VIDEO, PHOTOS)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155424-donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f2/00/00/donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters.jpg" title="Photo from Twitter/@GrahamWP_UK"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 16:14:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f2/00/00/donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />There's gunfire, explosions and brutal clashes in the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine as fighting erupted between pro- and anti-govt protesters, RT’s stringer reports from the scene.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f2/00/00/donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo from Twitter/@GrahamWP_UK" /> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Video in a minute, pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine demos have met, and it's ugly. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Donetsk&amp;src=hash">#Donetsk</a><a href="http://t.co/ODfvGmhHHk">pic.twitter.com/ODfvGmhHHk</a> </p> <p> — GrahamWPhillips (@GrahamWP_UK) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamWP_UK/statuses/460810128896163842">April 28, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> 14 people have asked for medical assistance, with several hospitalized, after clashes in Donetsk, the regional administration told Interfax-Ukraine news agency. <br><br> According to Novosti Donbassa (Donbas News), eight people have been taken to the city’s Kalinin hospital after violence broke out. <br><br> The website also reports of a policeman being shell-shocked due to handmade grenade exploding near him. </p><p> Pro- and-anti-Kiev protest rallies took place simultaneously in the city. </p><p> According to RT’s stringer Graham Phillips, there were plenty of masked young men on both sides, and they were clearly looking for a fight. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-L4k62QabIM" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> The police failed to contain the crowd as protesters clashed with each other, using firecrackers, smoke grenades, baseball bats and sticks. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Po9op0k4WYs" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> A group of about 1,000 “neo-Nazi thugs” has come to Donetsk from Dnepropetrovsk on Monday to cause provocations, the press-service of the self-proclaimed People’s Republic of Donetsk told RT. <br><br><em>“We were expecting an attack.

Non-fatal shootings also occurred, including a drive-by that injured four men who were standing on a sidewalk. </p><p> The first of the weekend’s fatalities occurred Friday evening, when 32-year-old Leonore Draper was found shot inside of a parked vehicle in the West Pullman neighborhood, about an hour after she reportedly left an anti-violence event. Local residents told police they heard gunshots around 10:30 p.m. </p><p> When police found Draper – a Chicago Public Schools budget analyst – she had suffered gunshot wounds to her chest and arm. She was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead just after 12:30 a.m. Police told the Sun-Times they are looking into the possibility that the incident was a drive-by. </p><p> Around 1:15 a.m. on Saturday, 21-year-old Martarvian Emery was at home with a 19-year-old woman when an unknown individual standing outside opened fire. The assailant fatally shot Emery in the chest, who was declared dead at the scene, and also wounded the woman in the leg. She was taken to a hospital and is in stable condition, according to the Chicago Tribune. </p><p> A little more than an hour later, Jaquez Williams, 17, was declared dead in the Austin neighborhood on Chicago’s West Side. Williams was standing outside when an unknown individual approached him and shot him in the head. </p><p> The most recent death occurred on early Sunday morning, when Cindy Bahena, 21, was shot and killed in the back seat in the back seat of a car being driven by a known gang member. According to the Sun-Times, police News Affair Officer Hector Alfaro said multiple men were standing near the car when one of them began shouting gang slogans and fired shots at the vehicle. </p><p> Bahena is not believed to be the intended target of the shooting. She was taken to a hospital but declared dead at 12:47 a.m. </p><p> Even before the past weekend’s fatalities were being tallied, the Tribune reported deadly encounter between an off-duty police officer and his 86-year-old neighbor on Friday afternoon. According to police, an argument between the two parties escalated when the neighbor shot and wounded the officer’s wife. This caused the officer to fatally shoot the man, and subsequently shoot and injure the neighbor’s wife when she reportedly attempted to reach for her husband’s shotgun. </p><p> No arrests have been made in connection to any of these crimes, though authorities say they are investigating. </p><p> These events are just the latest in a string of deadly weekends in Chicago. As RT <a href="http://rt.com/usa/dead-injured-chicago-violence-820/" target="_blank">reported previously</a>, Easter weekend saw shootings take the lives of 9 people and injure 32 others. At the time, the city had seen 288 people victimized by shootings since the start of 2014. In 2013, approximately 2,100 people were involved in shootings. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155368-hitler-parallel-washington-post/</guid><title><![CDATA[Hitler parallel debate rages in Washington Post]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155368-hitler-parallel-washington-post/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/80/00/hitler-parallel-washington-post.jpg" title="The Washington Post headquarters in Washington (Reuters/Stelios Varias)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 15:24:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ee/80/00/hitler-parallel-washington-post.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The head of a prominent Russian think tank is battling it out on the pages of the Washington Post over what he calls “disturbing” views attributed to him regarding the historical nature of Hitler’s Nazi regime and recent events that transpired in Crimea.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/80/00/hitler-parallel-washington-post.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="The Washington Post headquarters in Washington (Reuters/Stelios Varias)" /> <p> The whole firestorm erupted over an article written by Andranik Migranyan, who heads up the New York office of the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation, for Izvesti earlier this month. </p><p> Dismissing critics who had likened Russian President Vladimir Putin to the notorious Nazi leader, Migranyan <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/568603" target="_blank">said</a>: <em>“One must distinguish between Hitler before 1939 and Hitler after 1939. The thing is that Hitler collected [German] lands. If he had become famous only for uniting without a drop of blood Germany with Austria, Sudetenland and Memel, in fact completing what Bismarck failed to do, and if he had stopped there, then he would have remained a politician of the highest class."</em> </p><p> Several weeks later, Washington Post opinion writer Richard Cohen <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/richard-cohen-a-putin-affiliate-evokes-hitler-the-west-should-be-worried/2014/04/21/ddbd3794-c980-11e3-95f7-7ecdde72d2ea_story.html?hpid=z2" target="_blank">pounced on</a> Migranyan’s position and its <em>“chilling content.”</em> </p><p> <em>“If something like this is what Putin has in mind — gathering Russian-speaking people under his rule — then Migranyan seems to be saying: What’s the big deal? What he does not mention, though, is that by 1939 Hitler was already engaged in killing Jews, dissidents, communists, homosexuals and, that year, the mentally and physically feeble…For anyone, least of all a think-tank director, to overlook this record is frightening.”</em> </p><p> On Saturday, Migranyan <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/more-thoughts-on-putin-and-ukraine/2014/04/25/5e9beb66-cc75-11e3-b81a-6fff56bc591e_story.html" target="_blank">replied to</a> Cohen in the Post, expressing his surprise at the views which had been attributed to him. </p><p> <em>“Notwithstanding Mr. Cohen’s assertions, I am well aware of Adolf Hitler’s perverted ideology and horrific crimes. In the article Mr. Cohen cited, I wrote that Hitler ‘became known as one of the greatest evildoers in history because he set before himself and Germany’s people the delusional idea of world domination, proclaimed entire peoples to be inferior, tried to establish the superiority of the Aryan race over other, less worthy races and made it his goal to exterminate tens of millions of Slavs, Jews, Gypsies and other ethnicities,</em>” he said. </p><p> <em>“It is precisely these delusional ideas that led to Hitler’s and all Germans’ dismal end.’ The central point of my article was that Hitler’s unique evil made it inappropriate to compare his actions to what happened in Crimea. Mr. Cohen’s column did not reflect my views.”</em> </p><p> Noting how his own family suffered as a result of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Migranyan said he will <em>“always reject Hitler and his methods.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155364-ukraine-nazi-division-march/</guid><title><![CDATA[Neo-Nazis march in Lvov 'in honor' of Ukrainian Waffen SS division (PHOTOS)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155364-ukraine-nazi-division-march/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/40/00/ukraine-ss-division-march.jpg" title="Ukrainian ultra-nationalists carry emblems of 14th SS-Volunteer Division &quot;Galician&quot; as they march in the center of the western city of Lviv on April 27, 2014 to mark the 71st anniversary of 14th SS-Volunteer Division &quot;Galician&quot; foundation.

(RIA Novosti)" /> <p> Around five hundred neo-Nazi supporters took to the streets in the center of the city on Sunday to celebrate the creation of the 14th SS-Volunteer Division ‘Galician’ on April 28, 1943. <br><br> Many of the participants wore embroidered national Ukrainian shirts and held SS Galician divisional insignias (a yellow lion and three crowns on a blue background) in their hands. <br><br> The demonstrators made their way from the monument to the Ukrainian nationalist icon of Stepan Bandera, and to the local cemetery where a memorial to the Galician soldiers is erected. </p><p> </p><p> Bandera was the head of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), which collaborated with Nazi Germany, and was involved in the ethnic cleansing of Poles, Jews and Russians. <br><br> The action went on despite calls from the local administration to abstain from public gatherings on the day as it <em>“may harm the unity of the country.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> The march was staged by ‘Native Land’ and ‘Student Brotherhood of Stepan Bandera’ – radical organizations, supported by local motorcycle enthusiasts. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xVWBeApyje0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> </p><p> Despite the organizers promising that the rally would be a silent one, there were a lot of nationalist chants heard in Lvov. <br><br> However, slogans like – <em>“SS Galician Division!” “People of Lvov are the strongest!”</em> <em>“Glory to the nation – death to enemies!”</em> and <em>“Bandera and Shukhevich are heroes of Ukraine!”</em> – weren’t welcomed by many of the city’s residents, the UNIAN news agency reports. <br><br> It resulted in the route of the march being shortened and the organizers apologizing to those who were offended by the chants. </p><p> </p><p> Around two hundred policemen provided security during the march, which proceeded without serious violations of public order. <br><br> None of the actual participants of the SS Galician Division were noticed taking part in the action, RIA-Novosti reports. <br><br> The Nazi occupational forces picked the SS Galician Division from volunteers in western Ukraine in order to tackle Soviet and Polish partisans. </p><p> </p><p> The military formation, which became well-known for its ferocity, existed for over a year before being crushed by the Red Army in July 1944. <br><br> During the Nuremberg trials, all those who were officially acknowledged as SS members were labeled war criminals, and the Nazi organization itself was banned. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155244-kerry-israel-apartheid-state/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Kerry: Israel risks turning into ‘apartheid state’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155244-kerry-israel-apartheid-state/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e6/c0/00/kerry-israel-apartheid-state.jpg" title="U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Reuters/Brendan Smialowski)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 15:03:12 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e6/c0/00/kerry-israel-apartheid-state.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />US Secretary of State John Kerry has reportedly warned that Israel risks becoming “an apartheid state” if there’s no two-state solution to the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e6/c0/00/kerry-israel-apartheid-state.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Reuters/Brendan Smialowski)" /> <p> <em>“A two-state solution will be clearly underscored as the only real alternative,”</em> Kerry said. <em>“Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second-class citizens – or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state.</em>” </p><p> He was speaking with senior officials from the US, Western Europe, Russia and Japan in a closed-door meeting Friday. A recording of his comments was obtained by the Daily Beast. In his comments, Kerry also criticized the Israeli government’s settlements policy, which he said had halted the peace talks between Israel and Palestine. </p><p> <em>“There is a fundamental confrontation and it is over settlements – 14,000 new settlement units announced since we began negotiations. It’s very difficult for any leader to deal under that cloud,”</em> Kerry said, according to The Daily Beast. </p><p> However, he added that both Israel and Palestine share the blame for the current impasse in the peace talks. Along with Israel, he also denounced the Palestinian authorities, who don’t recognize the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. </p><p> <em>“There’s a period here where there needs to be some regrouping. I don’t think it’s unhealthy for both of them to have to stare over the abyss and understand where the real tensions are and what the real critical decisions are that have to be made,”</em> Kerry said. <em>“Neither party is quite ready to make it at this point in time. That doesn’t mean they don’t have to make these decisions.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> The US seldom criticizes its top Middle East ally. However, US officials have made a number of harsh remarks recently. In November 2013, Kerry warned Israel about increased isolation, while in February he warned Israel that a failure in the peace talks could lead to a global boycott of the Jewish state. </p><p> State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki tried to clarify Kerry’s comments to The Daily Beast. </p><p> According to Psaki, US Secretary of State was simply repeating the view expressed by others about a two-state solution. </p><p> <em>“Secretary Kerry, like Justice Minister Livni … was reiterating why there's no such thing as a one-state solution if you believe, as he does, in the principle of a Jewish State. He was talking about the kind of future Israel wants and the kind of future both Israelis and Palestinians would want to envision,”</em> she said. </p><p> Apartheid was a system of racial segregation in South Africa in the period between 1948 and 1994. </p><p> The system classified the country’s residents into racial groups; <em>"black", "white", "colored", and "Indian."</em> Black people were deprived of their citizenship, legally becoming citizens of one of 10 tribally based self-governing homelands. The government also segregated education, medical care, beaches, and other public services, and provided black people with services inferior to those of white people. </p><p> According to the 1998 Rome Statute, the <em>"crime of apartheid”</em> is defined as <em>“inhumane acts… committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.”</em> </p><p> Previously United Nations investigators and human rights advocates also accused Israel of committing the crime of apartheid. </p><p> </p><p> In 2004 John Dugard, then UN's Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories described the situation in the West Bank as <em>"an apartheid regime ... worse than the one that existed in South Africa."</em> </p><p> In 2009 Irish peace activist and Nobel peace laureate Mairead Maguire criticized Israel for <em>"racist and apartheid policies of siege, occupation and militarization of both Israel and Palestinian villages and towns."</em> </p><p> Relations between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority have deteriorated dramatically over the past month, culminating in the imposition of sanctions on Palestine by Israel. </p><p> The sanctions included the freezing the transfer of all taxes collected in Israel to Palestine. Israel monthly collects some $110 million in taxes on goods bound for the Palestinian territory, which roughly amounts to around two-thirds of the income received by the Palestinian Authority. </p><p> Negotiations between the two sides took a turn for the worse at the beginning of April, when Abbas submitted applications to join 15 international conventions, prompting a sharp condemnation from Israel, which branded the move as unilateral step toward statehood and a violation of the terms of negotiation. </p><p> In response, Israel refused to carry out scheduled prisoner releases. </p><p> On April 23, Israel suspended peace talks with Palestine over the unity deal signed in Gaza between Hamas group (considered terrorist in Israel) and Abbas's Fatah faction. </p><p> Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said that Palestine must choose with either peace with Israel or an alliance with Hamas, but he cannot have both. </p><p> </p><p> Israel and the Palestinian Authority now face an April 29 deadline to resolve their differences and make headway with bilateral talks before Washington withdraws its support. </p><p> Meanwhile, Palestine is currently pursuing attempt to become a full member of the world community and seeks membership in at least 60 United Nations bodies and international agreements, AFP reported, citing a statement from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). </p><p> The Palestine Liberation Organization's central council <em>"affirms the need for the Palestinian leadership to continue membership of UN agencies and international conventions,"</em> the Palestine People's Party secretary general Bassam al-Salhi said in a statement. </p><p> Palestine has been an official UNESCO member since 2011. In 2012 the country became an observer state member of the UN with an overwhelming vote in favor. Though the Palestinian mission cannot vote on UN resolutions, it can vote in elections for judges on international courts. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155396-turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Re-definition of Turkey over Armenian Genocide]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155396-turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/f0/40/00/turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia.jpg" title="Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan (Reuters/Umit Bektas)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 14:44:03 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/f0/40/00/turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The past is a foreign country goes the quote that has now become nothing but a well-worn cliché.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/f0/40/00/turkey-us-armenian-genocide-anatolia.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan (Reuters/Umit Bektas)" /> <p> In today's Turkey most people would probably agree with the sentiment, as "Ottomania" is all the rage and a self-professed interest in history (meaning Ottoman history) has become something akin to a national obsession – a fascination expressed in high ratings for television programs showcasing various personalities of differing academic (and/or political) persuasions pontificate about this or that titbit of Ottoman minutiae. Even the Turkish soap opera industry has become subject to this Ottoman fad, leading to such travesties as "The Magnificent Century" acquainting the public-at-large with well-known yet strangely unknown facts of 'national' history – as when the nation suddenly realized that the universally well-loved Sultan Süleyman (the 'Magnificent' one, after all) had his first-born son Mustafa murdered in cold blood. But apart from such quasi-spontaneous history lessons, the primary purpose of the current love of all things Ottoman sweeping the Turkey is clearly escapist in nature. At the same time, however, the government cunningly utilizes the people's escapist tendencies to push through its own agenda, an agenda that attempts to rewrite certain aspects of Turkish (if not Ottoman) history while, simultaneously, stressing the Islamic nature of the Republic and its imperial predecessor. Decades of Kemalist propaganda and indoctrination have succeeded in equating the terms 'Ottoman" and 'Islamic' in the Turkish mind. </p><p> In Turkey every year the approach of the month of April is accompanied by frantic lobbying activities across the pond (meaning millions of dollars well-spent) and public proclamations of Turkish (or Muslim) innocence at home. The reason for this recurring series of events has to do with a troubling episode in recent Ottoman history, and the question whether Turks (in reality, Ottoman policy-makers and their subject Muslim citizens) living in the early 20th-century did commit a series of crimes against humanity, culminating in genocide, or to be more precise terminating in the "Armenian Genocide". Throughout the post-war period, the Turkish authorities have continuously upheld that Turks could not have committed such an atrocious crime, but instead the then-Istanbul authorities had merely taken drastic relocation measures against an Armenian uprising in eastern Anatolia in view of Armenian complicity in Russian military ventures against the Ottoman state in the course of the Great War (subsequently known as World War I, 1914-18). </p><p> In this context, the role of the United States' Congress has always been of paramount importance. This year marked a departure from that clichéd path, as the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives John Boehner gave assurance to Turkey, on 15 April, that Congress will not get involved in any "Armenian genocide" bill – well ahead of the dreaded April 24th, the Genocide Remembrance Day, when in 1915 the first Armenian victims of the Ottoman policy of ethnic cleansing were deported from Istanbul. Boehner visited Turkey as part of a multi-country trip to the region (also visiting Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates), accompanied by a high-level congressional delegation. </p><p> In Ankara, John Boehner met the Speaker of the Turkish Parliament Cemil Cicek, and afterwards told reporters that "[t]he issue about Armenians comes onto the [Congress'] agenda from time to time. Don't worry. Our Congress will not get involved in this issue, we are not writing history, we are also not historians." Boehner went on to say that the US tries to improve bilateral ties with Ankara, while expressing his appreciation for Turkish support on such hot-button issues like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. </p><p> </p><p> In return, Cicek waxed lyrically about Turkey and America, indicating that the Armenian issue constitutes a "burden" in bilateral relations between the two allies. In this instance, Cicek undoubtedly had the US Senate's Resolution 410, passed on 4 April, in mind. The resolution proclaims "that the President should ensure that US foreign policy reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the US record relating to the Armenian Genocide." </p><p> The Republican-controlled House clearly favors business-as-usual with Turkey, arguably continuing to buy more American arms and weapons as in the previous year when Turkey's top spot on the destination list for US-manufactured arms was followed by Egypt and South Korea. The Democrat-controlled Senate, on the other hand, appears to follow its conscience, accepting the Resolution this year, the first time in a quarter century that such a clear stance was taken by the US legislative chamber. As a result of the House's refusal to get involved in the Armenian issue, however, the bicameral legislature of the United States of America that is the US Congress did not adopt a binding resolution. The bill thus failed to reach the floor on the last working day before a two-week Easter recess (11 April), giving Boehner ample reason to include Turkey on his business trip to the Middle East. </p><h2> ‘Shying away historical reality’ </h2><p> With regards to the Armenian issue, 2014 marked a clear departure for Turkey on the domestic front as the popular yet divisive Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan decided to take a truly "unprecedented" step: on the Wednesday prior to the Genocide Remembrance Day, not by accident coinciding with the National Sovereignty and Children's Day in Turkey (23 April), the Prime Minister’s office issued a written statement regarding the Armenian issue, carrying his personal signature. It was published on the Prime Minister's website in several languages, including Turkish, English, and French, but also Armenian, Arabic, and Russian, among others. The text was not the outcome of a rushed decision, but clearly the result of a painstaking editorial process. Even though the letter starts off with the statement that the Remembrance Day "provides a valuable opportunity to share opinions freely on a historical matter", arguably in line with traditional Turkish protestations that the whole matter is an historical issue, best left to historians, its following lines appear unprecedented if not groundbreaking. </p><p> The Prime Minister's letter treads carefully, unwilling to offend fervent Turkish nationalists, stating that "[m]illions of people of all religions and ethnicities lost their lives in the First World War. Having experienced events which had inhumane consequences – such as relocation – during the First World War, should not prevent Turks and Armenians from establishing compassion and mutually humane attitudes towards one another." </p><p> In the next instance, however, Tayyip Erdogan pulls out all the stops, announcing that "[i]n today’s world, deriving enmity from history and creating new antagonisms are neither acceptable nor useful for building a common future"; followed by the letter's pièce de résistance, "[i]t is our hope and belief that the peoples of an ancient and unique geography, who share similar customs and manners will be able to talk to each other about the past with maturity and to remember together their losses in a decent manner. And it is with this hope and belief that we wish that the Armenians who lost their lives in the context of the early twentieth century rest in peace, and we convey our condolences to their grandchildren". </p><p> Shying away from actually acknowledging the historical reality of the "Armenian Genocide", Erdogan has now become the first Turkish politician to concede that the Ottoman policy of ethnic cleansing had disastrous consequences for the Armenian population of Anatolia, an "ancient and unique geography". One could argue that this concession is but the first step down the road to full acknowledgment of the genocidal results of the Ottoman population policy that attempted to transform Anatolia, the Ottoman heartland, into a purely Muslim entity. In fact, looking at the historical record, it seems that the Ottomans (or rather the Unionists or so-called Young Turks in charge of the Empire during the period 1908-18) had all but relied on actions previously carried out by their German allies to realise their goal of a Muslim homeland in Anatolia. Even though many commentators and even historians refer to the Armenian issue as the 20th century's first genocide, in reality the German Empire under Kaiser Wilhelm II (1888-1918) had already constituted a precedent previously. </p><p> </p><p> The Dutch historian Jan-Bart Gewald, matter-of-factly relates that "[b]etween 1904 and 1908 Imperial German troops committed genocide in German South West Africa (GSWA), present-day Namibia." Germany's late and short ("about thirty-five years", as expressed by the sociologist Gurminder K. Bhambra) entry into Europe's colonial game overseas led to extreme measures. In South West Africa, German settlers employed the Herero-German war to 'rightfully' occupy territory belonging to the Herero tribes. This land-grab was preceded by "the planned and officially sanctioned attempted extermination of the Herero people". As the Ottomans had enjoyed good relations with the German Empire ever since the early years of Sultan Abdülhamid II (1876-1909), it would stand to reason to assume that the Unionists were eager to apply the German experiences in South West Africa to their own territorial designs for Anatolia. As outlined in an <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/turkey-kurdish-issue-2023-936/" target="_blank">earlier piece</a> of mine, the Unionists' policies of social engineering "were aimed at transforming Anatolia (the heartland of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic’s geo-body, using Thongchai Winichakul’s coinage denoting the territory of a nation as expressed on a map and inscribed on the people’s consciousness) into a Muslim homeland where refugees from the Russian Empire and the Balkans were settled. Prior to the formulation of Turkish nationalism as an ideological binding-force [in 1922], the diverse ethnic groups in Anatolia were united by their common identity as Muslims and their allegiance to the Ottoman Caliphate, abolished in 1924". </p><p> As a result, the fact that Turkey's PM Erdogan used this year's Children's Day, the Turkish public holiday that commemorates the first opening of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (the nation's parliament) in Ankara in 1920, to express his condolences to the Armenian nation, is not coincidental. Turkish critics of the PM have oftentimes expressed their misgivings about Erdogan's apparent desire to return Turkey and its government to its original inception three years' prior to the foundation of the Republic and the Turkish nation state. When the original Grand National Assembly was founded, its constituency consisted of Anatolian Muslims. The concept of a Turkish nation in Anatolia was introduced in 1922, and, as I expressed in my earlier piece, "[o]pponents of Erdogan and the AKP now fear that the government’s long-term goal ... is to transform the nation state Turkey into an Anatolian federation of Muslim ethnicities, possibly linked to a revived caliphate." Against this backdrop, Tayyip Erdogan's condolences to the Armenian nation appear like a preamble to establishing a new (or old) definition of Anatolia (or Turkey) as an "ancient and unique geography" inhabited solely by Muslim population groups. Acknowledging the reality that Christian populations, like the Armenians, once formed part of Anatolia's social mix is but a prelude to recognising that today's Anatolians are all Muslim, and will remain so forever. </p><p> In other words, as the US pragmatically continues to dodge the Armenian bullet, Turkey's AKP leadership seems bent on continuing its long-term policy goals that could lead to a re-definition of Turkey. Will the Turkish nation state eventually become an Anatolian federation of Muslim ethnicities? Does Erdogan's expression of grief signal his ultimate goal of becoming the Turkish leader who revived Anatolia's commitment to the cause of the Prophet and will Turkey of the future look like the Anatolia of the past? </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155376-muslim-brotherhood-trials-egypt/</guid><title><![CDATA[Political cleansing in Egypt is full speed ahead]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155376-muslim-brotherhood-trials-egypt/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ef/00/00/muslim-brotherhood-trials-egypt.jpg" title="Relatives and families of supporters of ousted President Mohamed Mursi do the Rabaa sign near security forces, after hearing the sentence handed to Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and other Brotherhood supporters, at the court in Minya, south of Cairo April 28, 2014.

(Reuters)" /> <p> On April 28 an Egyptian court sentenced Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Mohamed Badie and 682 of its supporters to death. They faced charges of murder and attempted murder of several policemen during riots by Morsi supporters in the southern province of Minya on August 14 last year. Just a month ago, the same judge, Said Youssef, <a href="http://rt.com/news/155284-egypt-court-death-penalty/" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to death 529 supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi after just a two-day trial. All but 37 defendants had their sentences commuted to life. President Morsi was removed by the military last July and since then Egypt has seen large scale persecution and elimination of Muslim Brotherhood members. </p><p> The recent verdict turned out to be a real shock for the international community, with many voices calling for external involvement aimed at stopping bloodshed and cleansing.

Defense lawyer Ahmed Hefni told reporters outside the court that the death sentences now will be submitted to Egypt's Mufti for the approval, the highest religious authority, but his decision is mostly a formality and is not legally binding. </p><h2> MB goes underground </h2><p> The Muslim Brotherhood has been labeled an illegal organization, with over 16,000 members arrested or killed. After taking power for the first time in 2012, the Muslim Brotherhood now has to go underground. Moreover, as Egypt plunges into a new era of even more bloody dictatorship it presents the severest challenge to the state’s stability since the time of Nasser. The Brothers are being forced to resort to violence and reorganize into a quasi-militia to protect their members. The possibility of a new wave of deadly attacks carried out by Brothers shouldn’t be ruled out. </p><p> It’s obvious that there is no room for justice in Egypt now. The UN and human rights activists have denounced the speedy character of the trials, though it seems to be ignored by Egypt’s authorities. Many of those accused are believed not to have been present at the riots near police stations. </p><p> </p><p> Lack of proof, extremely fast trials with no access by the families of the defendants, limited options of punishment, namely life sentence and death – all these speak for themselves. The ruling authorities are continuing a violent crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood who represent a significant force in Egypt. In other words, it seems that the military, headed by al-Sisi who is expected to be the “winner” at the presidential polls, are pursuing a policy of political cleansing, paving the way for themselves, and getting rid of any strong rivals…or rivals in general. </p><h2> Who is next? </h2><p> On the same day, April 28, an Egyptian court banned all April 6 Movement activities inside Egypt and ordered the confiscation of its headquarters. </p><p> The April 6 Youth Movement is an opposition political movement founded in 2008 by a number of young people in support of a general strike held then by textile workers of Al-Mahalla, the largest city of the Gharbiya governorate, which is about 80 km north of Cairo. April 6 played a significant role in the January 25 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak in 2011. It also opposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, arguing he did not fulfill his presidential campaign promises, and protested against the military regime installed after Morsi’s overthrow. The case against April 6 was filed by lawyer Ashraf Said who is accusing the movement of defaming the country’s image and colluding with foreign parties. Its leader Ahmed Maher is already serving a three-year jail term for violating a law that bans all but police-sanctioned protests. </p><p> Hence, one more political player in Egypt is under attack. While nobody knows how the case against the April 6 movement would end up, and so it makes any adversaries of military rule think they could be next. </p><p> <em>Irina Sukhoparova, RT</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155372-tornado-mayflower-arkansas-twister/</guid><title><![CDATA[Mayflower Arkansas devastation: Deadly tornado destroys everything in its path]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155372-tornado-mayflower-arkansas-twister/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ee/c0/00/tornado-mayflower-arkansas-storm.jpg" title="A damaged vehicle is seen amid debris after a tornado hit the town of Mayflower, Arkansas around 7:30 pm CST, late April 27, 2014.

Now Kabul is asking them not to leave Afghanistan so that the Taliban will not attack them,” a Pashtun from Kabul in his Moscow shop muses.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/c0/00/afghanistan.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="" /> <p> <em>“Just imagine: we had 44 countries invading Afghanistan with modern weapons, satellite monitoring, tanks and missiles. The Taliban has an army of less than 20,000. We have 400,000 Afghan troops and 200,000 Americans with the most advanced weaponry. How is it possible that they can’t prevail over the Taliban?”</em> he says. </p><p> A PhD-qualified engineer by profession, he trades a range of Oriental items from hookahs to incense sticks. We’ve been talking about the elections for two hours, with visitors coming in and leaving without being served, and other Afghans joining our discussion with eagerness. </p><p> There are only a handful of places in Moscow where you can get a glimpse of people from different Afghan tribes and social strata. One of them is a former hotel in the city suburbs housing a multitude of shops and firms owned by Afghans. They all retain close ties with their homeland, make regular visits and keep daily contact with their families and business partners. </p><p> Those who do business in Russia usually have quite a good background and a decent profession. They work here despite the fact the clans they come from fought the Soviet army in 1979-1989. But that was a long time ago. The US army has been in Afghanistan for 13 years and Afghans do not have much respect for either the Americans or those who they support. </p><h2> Endangered elections </h2><p> Elections in the east are being increasingly associated with terror acts and mysterious problems with vote counting. </p><p> Ironically, political analysts may soon pick up some of the language used by journalists. The developments in Afghanistan and Iraq indicate that elections in a country with a US troop presence are always hailed as success, while a vote in a country left by US troops merely serves as a backdrop for terror attacks. </p><p> Curiously enough, in the old Western democracies the elites negotiate before the elections, whereas in Afghanistan, it looks like the election comes prior to negotiations. This seems to be the only explanation as to why it takes them almost three weeks to count the votes, and why they’ve postponed the announcement of the results for the 4th time. The election took place on April 5 and the votes were supposed to be counted by April 24. Then it was postponed to May 14, so that the second round could start on May 28. </p><p> I’d like to remind that four years ago, it took Iraq a record four months to count the votes from its election. The current prime minister stayed in office, but his bloc in the parliament lost one vote to the opposition. </p><p> The behind-the-scenes struggle continues in Afghanistan. It would be naïve to believe that the Afghan independent commission is unable to count quickly. The clans and advisers just didn’t rush it, as they were fighting for the second round and for the difference in votes. </p><p> Right now this difference has become more distinct, when the conventional anti-Americanism pole represented by Abdullah Abdullah got the upper hand over the most pro-American candidate, Ashraf Ghani. </p><p> </p><p> This division is quite feeble though. Before the election they both had stated that they supported the presence of the US troops in the country. Whereas President Karzai finished his tenure with a patriotic gesture of refusing to sign the agreement for the US troop presence. He also took his brother off the presidential candidates’ list and directed his supporters to unlikely candidate Zamlai Rassoul. </p><p> At the moment, according to another preliminary count, Abdullah Abdullah wins this election. He looks more or less remote from the occupation forces compared to other candidates. His name is associated with Ahmad Shakh Massoud, who was mysteriously murdered on September 11, 2001. Many believe he was a Mujahideen physician, if not a Mujahideen himself. </p><p> Abdullah does have a flaw in his biography. From the viewpoint of a Pashtun, the main Afghan tribe, he is a Tajik, as is his mother. <em>“Can a Tajik rule Afghanistan?”</em> This is something any Pashtun would ask you, unless they are related to the occupation forces. Moreover, his name is related to the reputation of the Afghan Northern Alliance, which welcomed the US presence and had close cooperation with it. </p><p> However, for Afghans one’s origin isn’t the main concern. More importantly, these people who really value their independence feel that they have been invaded, in spite of the elections, speeches and promises. The behind-the-scenes war which they sense more clearly than the foreign observers do is a part of this invasion. </p><h2> Difficult choice </h2><p> What do the Afghan people think of the election? Most of the Moscow-based Afghans are happy to discuss it, but they don’t want their pictures taken. </p><p> Young Pashtuns aren’t very optimistic. I am talking to a Pashtun from Herat. He says he preferred Mohammad Ismail Khan, if anyone. He may be a Tajik but he is a Mujahideen, Herat-born and had been its governor for a long time. </p><p> <em>“Otherwise they all are crooks, and all they want is to sell out to the Americans,”</em> he says about the presidential candidates. </p><p> I ask him to clarify what’s there to sell in Afghanistan, as none of the shops have any Afghan products. </p><p> <em>“What’s there to sell? The whole of Afghanistan,”</em> he answers. </p><p> Most Afghans are convinced that their country is a crucial strategic center that the US wants to have just for the sake of it. </p><p> A Pashtun from Kabul has no respect for either of the candidates. He believes there was no voter turnout at all. Some of his family members did go to vote, and they told him there was no frenzy there. </p><p> A Pashtun called Nabi was born in Laghman. He had spent 10 years in prison during the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. He is an Afghan Marxist, and as most supporters of one Marxist fraction he became imprisoned when the other fraction got the upper hand. Just like many older Afghans, he is an underground revolutionary, a fighter, and a political prisoner who got self-educated while in prison, and his opinions are quite harsh. </p><p> The reason he doesn’t support Abdullah is not the fact that he is a Tajik. <em>“Hekmatyar is a Pashtun, but he is also a traitor, just like Abdullah is. And so is Sayyaf - a Pashtun and a traitor,”</em> he says. Marxists are very open about using strong terms. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“Abdullah bears the shadow of a traitor, as he had cooperated with everyone, just like his commander, Massoud,”</em> says Nabi. <em>“His people sold our concessions for mineral deposits extraction.”</em> </p><p> Nabi prefers Ghani, even though he bears <em>“a stamp of the American past.”</em> </p><p> Khusrow, a Tajik from Herat, openly chooses Abdullah because he is Tajik. </p><p> <em>“His mother is Tajik, so Pashtuns regard him as a stranger,”</em> he says. <em>“They say that he, who shakes hands with the ruler, will come to power too,”</em> he is trying to say that those people who are on a first-name basis with the authorities are well connected. </p><p> <em>“Abdullah will definitely get more votes, but such people as Abdullah can never be president. So Ghani is more likely to become the leader,”</em> he sadly says. <em>“Pashtuns will always rule in Afghanistan, and all the others will play football and fight,”</em> Khusrow predicts. </p><p> His Tajik friend who comes from Kabul has moved his family to India. </p><p> <em>“I’m not into politics. We didn’t vote for anyone – there is nobody worth voting for.”</em> </p><p> The Hazara brothers, Ysa and Nadyr, are split. Nadyr supports Abdullah out of principle. </p><p> <em>“Pashtuns didn’t like the Taliban people as well, although they were Pashtuns too. I support Abdullah, not because he is Pashtun, but because he plans for the future,”</em> he says. </p><p> He likes it that Abdullah participates in elections together with Mouhakkik who is Hazara. </p><p> <em>“He has always been a part of our society, he gets us. He has been our leader for a long time. I think Abdullah will win. Ghani’s deputy Sarwar Danesh is Hazara too. He is pro-Iranian, unlike Mouhakkik, who is not so pro-Iranian. But we just want him to help his people – that’s what matters.”</em> </p><p> He hopes Abdullah can make a good president because he is slightly against Pakistan and against the USA. </p><p> Ysa doesn’t agree. <em>“Ghani is very experienced. He is like Putin, who looks ahead.”</em> </p><p> And that’s when Ysa thinks about the flipside. </p><p> <em>“I once asked a politician, why Russia doesn’t supply its missiles to Iran or Syria. He said it’s a policy. Politicians are not trustworthy – today they think this way, the next day they change their mind. Sayyaf had an agreement with the Hazara too, but eventually they got no protection. So the policy is like that: today we are friends, tomorrow we are foes.”</em> </p><p> He has no doubt that Ghani is going to win in the second round of the elections. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“Do you think Ghani will bring another USA? It was already brought [to Afghanistan] 13 years ago,”</em> Nadyr argues. </p><p> <em>“The Americans spent $600 billion in Afghanistan so they will not let us go. They went there to prop up their positions against Russia, China and Central Asia. The US has plans in Afghanistan for 50 years ahead. They will leave at least 10,000 troops there for sure. Ghani appeals to them simply because he is pro-American,”</em> Nadyr says. </p><p> Many people in Afghanistan believe the Taliban has been created and imposed by the US too, and it was aimed at taking over the country. Nadyr and Ysa have no doubts about that. </p><p> <em>“Some of Ghani’s advisors speak out against the Hazara all the time. Moreover, his wife is not a Muslim, she’s from Lebanon,”</em> which, by the way, is a serious point in Afghanistan. </p><p> <em>“Russia came here with tanks, while the US came to Afghanistan with television and cash. It takes a long time for them, but eventually they get what they want. They set up a base here. People are against them and want them to leave, to which Americans respond, “OK, we are leaving.” But there are always those who ask them to stay,”</em> Nadyr says, meaning both candidates are willing to sign the agreement on further presence of the US troops. </p><p> <em>“They started the mess in Ukraine while being here and now make troubles in Dagestan. They aim at stirring up troubles in order to isolate Russia from the rest of the world. The Afghan people understand the essence of the US policy quite well now. But Americans also target the young people. There are some who think that since Americans brought television and the internet, they should stay,”</em> Ysa says, apparently not minding. He is among these young people. </p><p> <em>“Nothing happens the way we want,”</em> Ysa admits. And that’s true – nobody has asked the Afghan people in the last 35 years what they really want. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155272-ukraine-slovakia-reverse-gas/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukraine strikes 3.2 bcm reverse gas flow deal with Slovakia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155272-ukraine-slovakia-reverse-gas/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e8/80/00/ukraine_slovakia_reverse_gas_flow.jpg" title="Workers stand near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters/Gleb Garanich)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 13:18:44 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e8/80/00/ukraine_slovakia_reverse_gas_flow.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Energy-pinched Ukraine has reached a deal to start reverse gas flows from Central European neighbors via an unused pipeline to Slovakia. Starting from October, Ukraine will import 3.2 billion cubic meters of gas.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e8/80/00/ukraine_slovakia_reverse_gas_flow.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Workers stand near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters/Gleb Garanich)" /> <p> Ukraine and Slovakia signed a memorandum of intent in Bratislava on Monday. The European Commission said the cooperation between Slovakia and Ukraine is a <em>“win-win for both parties”</em>. </p><p> <em>“It shows the EU's strong commitment in support of Ukraine's energy sector, which is also reflected in the economic and financial package the Union has swiftly provided for Ukraine in the past weeks. I would like to thank Energy Commissioner Oettinger and his team, who played a central role in paving the way for today’s agreement,”</em> Jose Barroso, President of the European Commission, who attended the ceremony, said in a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-487_en.htm" target="_blank">statement</a>. </p><p> By next spring, deliveries from Vojany, Slovakia to the western Ukrainian city of Uzhorod could reach 10 billion cubic meters, the amount European Commissioner for Energy Gunter Oettinger requested. </p><p> Deliveries from Slovakia could satisfy up to 20 percent of Ukraine’s natural gas demand, which in 2013 was 55 billion cubic meters. </p><p> In April, German energy company RWE <a href="http://rt.com/business/germany-rwe-gas-ukraine-656/" target="_blank">started</a> delivering gas to Ukraine using reverse flow through Poland. The gas is being supplied under a 2012 contract where RWE can deliver up to 10 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine per year. </p><p> Between these two deals alone, Ukraine has upped its supply from Europe ten-fold. Last year Ukraine imported around 2 billion cubic meters of gas from EU member states. </p><p> Ukraine imports nearly 50 percent of its natural gas from Russia, a country it now finds itself at diplomatic ends with, as it moves towards possible EU integration. In 2013, the country bought 27.7 billion meters, from Gazprom, Russia’s largest state-owned natural gas producer. </p><p> The deal is a short-term solution for Ukraine, which can no longer afford Russian gas after Moscow cancelled all gas discounts for Kiev, as it waits for Ukraine to repay an overdue gas bill of $2.2 billion. </p><p> Ukraine’s Energy Ministry was hoping to unlock more gas imports from its European neighbors, but Slovakian authorities must be careful not avoid any <a href="http://rt.com/business/gas-miller-ukraine-debt-553/" target="_blank">legal issues</a> with Gazprom. </p><p> Currently Ukraine needs to pay <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-gas-price-ukraine-113/" target="_blank">$485 per thousand cubic meters</a> for Russian gas, which compares to $268.5 agreed between Russia and Ukraine in December. </p><p> Ukraine currently has a “take-and-pay” contract with Gazprom which it is required to buy 41.6 billion cubic meters of gas in order to receive discount prices. In 2013, Ukraine only bough 12.9 billion cubic meters of gas, which prompted Gazprom last week to send Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state oil and gas company, a bill for $11.4 billion. </p><p> Ukraine presidential candidate Pyotr Poroshenko has said that by 2015, Ukraine will stop buying Russian gas. More neighbors may be tapped to start supplying gas to Ukraine, perhaps Poland or Hungary. </p><h2> Time to diversify? </h2><p> In the wake of the <a href="http://rt.com/news/eastern-ukraine-army-operation-680/" target="_blank">Ukraine crisis</a>, many of Gazprom's European customers have been second-guessing Russian gas, and have <a href="http://rt.com/business/eu-us-energy-summit-929/">renewed</a> conversations of lessening dependence from their powerful neighbor. </p><p> Many countries in Eastern Europe believe the continent can achieve energy security and at the same time retain relations with Russia. Croatian President Ivo Josipovic doesn't see the energy as a zero sum game. </p><p> <em>"Diversifying supplies does not mean that the EU’s current gas, oil and coal suppliers, primarily Russia and Norway, will not continue to be important energy partners of the EU. What will change is that EU member countries will have more conceivable alternatives in the interest of energy security,"</em> Josipovic <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/04/28/guest-post-eu-must-address-energy-needs-of-eastern-members/?catid=491&amp;SID=google"> wrote</a> in an FT opinion piece on Monday. </p><p> Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk has been a main proponent of diversifying Europe's imports as well as <a href="http://rt.com/business/poland-shale-taxes-russia-346/">developing shale</a>, but their is still discord among much of Europe. In terms of developing shale, many states in Europe have banned the practice, while others, like Croatia, are taking a more cautious approach, than say, Poland or the <a href="http://rt.com/news/uk-government-fracking-industry-829/" target="_blank">UK</a>. </p><p> Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic import 100 percent of their natural gas from Russia and logically want to diversify their import options. Other countries like Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia, and Italy are very keen to continue doing business with Russia, especially on Gazprom's 'South Stream' project, which by 2018 will supply 64 billion cubic meters of natural gas to European markets. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/155344-russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor/</guid><title><![CDATA[Prosecutor General seeks tougher punishment for corruption]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/155344-russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/00/00/russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor.jpg" title="Yury Chaika, Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation (RIA Novosti/Vladimir Astapkovich)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:55:17 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ed/00/00/russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Top Russian Prosecutor has proposed a bill making a prison sentence the only punishment for anyone convicted of corruption. It is in line with President Vladimir Putin’s observation that the 2011 softening of anti-corruption laws was not working.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/00/00/russian-corruption-jail-prosecutor.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Yury Chaika, Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation (RIA Novosti/Vladimir Astapkovich)" /> <p> Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika addressed the upper house session on Monday and said that compensatory punishment or fines were not acting as a deterrent – one of the key points that provide the rule of law. </p><p> “<em>In order to rule out the possibility of bailing oneself out of a serious crime, like a corruption-related crime, by just paying a simple fine, a bill has been prepared that provides for only prison time for grave crimes, including corruption</em>,” the prosecutor told the lawmakers. </p><p> The current laws allowing <a href="http://rt.com/politics/medvedev-recommends-fines-bribery/" target="_blank">fines for bribery</a>, both in state administration and in private businesses, were introduced in 2011 under then-president Dmitry Medvedev as part of a campaign aimed at boosting entrepreneurship and improving the business climate in the country. Russian law enforcers opposed the move from the moment it was first suggested and prosecutors warned that the changes could simply lead to increases in bribes as criminals would seek compensation for future punishment. </p><p> However, in Autumn 2013 President Putin criticized the changes in his <a href="http://rt.com/politics/putin-corruption-tolerance-zero-965/" target="_blank">speech</a> before the Anti-Corruption Council – a special body of top law enforcers and state officials. </p><p> “<em>The practice shows us that the liberalization is not working the way it should</em>,” Putin said. According to the president, 692 people were convicted for taking bribes in the first half of 2013 and only 8 percent of them were sentenced to prison time, while the majority got away with fines that the criminals managed not to pay by using various loopholes. </p><p> Putin then told the council members that he expected them to submit particular suggestions on fighting corruption, suggesting to start with the area of communal services, consumer market and various government tenders. </p><p> Putin also urged the officials to make anti-graft standards universally accepted. He added that society and business had the right to demand the state strictly observed all anti-corruption laws, but should not act as indifferent observers. Moreover, quite often citizens were pushing civil servants towards violations in pursuit of their own business interests. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155348-us-administration-failure-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA['Obama and Kerry fail to show leadership qualities required to settle Ukrainian issue']]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155348-us-administration-failure-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/40/00/us-administration-failure-ukraine.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:33:26 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/40/00/us-administration-failure-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The US had set their eyes on the idea to make Ukraine the 29th EU state or perhaps even the 52nd US state, though it doesn’t have any clear scenario and simply continues "blamestorming" Russia, global financial markets expert Patrick Young told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ed/40/00/us-administration-failure-ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>President Obama says Russia's done nothing to meet its Geneva pledges. However, it’s likely to be more applicable to the US itself. Why is Washington acting like this?</em> </p><p> <strong>Patrick Young:</strong> I think the State Department is probably under great stress at the moment. Of course we’ve seen President Obama, in the course of the last three or four days, doing shuttle diplomacy through South-East Asia. This was supposed to be an incredible ceremonial tour where he would sign multiple free trade agreements, including with Japan. Instead he ended up to play football with robots in Tokyo. Why? Because ultimately his trade agenda is failing as it goes along. Therefore, given the poor quality of negotiation skills by the US, it’s hardly surprising that they are trying to do anything to take away the news. And therefore, we see Mr. Obama once again being a puppet ministered by the neo-cons that are still behind him, as an administration who simply see everything as being bad in Russia. It’s quite clear from what Mr. Lavrov has said, and has been saying, that he is trying everything to encourage people to disarm and therefore, active attempts to try to diffuse the Ukrainian situation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What is the American policy aimed at? Does the United States actually want the two sides in Ukraine to reach a deal?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> I think it’s very worrying because certainly the US seems to have had a remarkable transition in Ukraine. It seemed to be absolutely fine when you wanted to mount barricades in Maidan and there were people like John McCain to speak to them. Not only we have got this very fractured situation in Eastern Ukraine about which the Russians had previously warned us. Ultimately we have got a singular failure of diplomacy but particularly from the Western side at the moment. And of course what is happening, President Obama is rushing off to this mantra of claiming that he wants even greater sanctions. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What does the United States expect of Russia, then? It can't send in its military to disarm the pro-Russian protesters in Ukraine. It's asked them to disarm, what more can it do?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> Personally I’m confused because let’s put it another way. If Russia sent in troops to forcibly disarm the people who are holding the buildings, then America would claim they are invading. I really don’t know. The American picture is not clear. The Foreign Secretary Mr. Kerry perennially, as we know from his election campaign for president, has always been one peppermint tea short of a full bag of coffee when he is at the diner. Ultimately it’s a huge problem in this environment at the moment. I don’t think America knows what it wants because ultimately America had set their eyes on the idea Ukraine is going to be something like the 29th state of the EU or perhaps even the 52nd state of the US. None of those were ever going to come to pass, the money is not there from the US and Europe to support whether it’s the rump Ukraine or whichever part of Ukraine it is. It’s confusing. America is not clear and simply <em>"blamestorming"</em> Russia is not going to help the situation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Neither Kiev nor the protesters seem to have stuck to the Geneva accord. Are they each waiting for the other side to act first?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> The problem we have here is a huge loss of faith on all parts. America clearly doesn’t trust Russia, at the same time there is a huge number of people on the ground in Ukraine who’ve been simply left behind. We are not talking about particularly the Eastern Ukrainians who have actually invaded these buildings, those occupying groups are one thing. But actually let’s face it: Ukraine is being run by a non-democratically appointed government that seems to have the blessing of the US. It’s not democratic, there are democratic elections supposedly taking place at the moment but as we can see, all the great powers are in there trying to shuffle things for their influence. It looks very 19th century in the way the things are going on at the moment. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why can’t the sides of the conflict reach any compromise? Or why the US doesn’t want to negotiate with Russia at least?</em> </p><p> <strong>PY:</strong> Unfortunately, it is very difficult and this is a situation because after all as we know President Yanukovich, who was deeply flawed in his ability to govern, but was nonetheless the democratically elected president, ultimately had to flee the day after we had a group of Western politicians telling us that they had come to a wondrous solution in Kiev. Therefore, when there are challenges over the whole issue, it really requires leadership and statesmanship. The terrible problem is that Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry repeatedly fail to have those abilities that they demonstrate. Let’s put it another way. Today we are celebrating in Poland the canonization of Pope John Paul II, there was leader and he stood on the world stage at the time we had Mrs. Thatcher, Ronald Reagan – they may have been the absolute enemies of the old Soviet system but they were people who could do business with and did business with Mr. Gorbachev at the time. That’s the total change that we have in this situation, we have a series of political pygmies throughout the West, none of whom really realize that their word must be their bond. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/</guid><title><![CDATA[Obama rolls out new sanctions on Russia, Moscow says it won't hurt]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/40/00/obama-sanctions-putin-calculus.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama talks during a joint news conference at the Malacanang Palace in Manila, April 28, 2014.

(Reuters/Larry Downing)" /> <p> The individuals listed by the US Department of Treasury on Monday include Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, chair of the parliamentary commission on Foreign Affairs, Aleksey Pushkov, chief of presidential office, Vyacheslav Volodin, and Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft oil company. <br><br> The list of sanctioned companies, which Washington believes to be “linked to Putin’s inner circle,” includes several banks, construction and transport companies. <br><br> The Volga Group, an investment vehicle that manages assets on behalf of the businessman, Gennady Timchenko, and SMP Bank, whose main shareholders were affected by the previous set of US sanctions, are among those to face restrictive measures. <br><br> Oil and gas engineering company, Stroytransgaz, and one of Russia’s biggest rail transporters of oil, Transoil, are also among the companies affected by the sanctions. <br><br> The US Department of Commerce has introduced additional restrictions on 13 of those companies by imposing a license requirement with a presumption of denial for the export, re-export or other foreign transfer of US-originating items to the companies. <br><br> Later in the day, Washington announced a tightened policy to deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russia’s military capabilities. <br><br> But the US may move even further and impose sanctions against specific branches of the Russian economy if Moscow begins a military operation in Ukraine, Jay Carney, White House spokesman, said. </p><p> The announcement of a new round of US sanctions against Russia is “revolting” as they go against the way civilized states should communicate, Sergey Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, said. <br><em><br> “We will respond, although it is not our choice,”</em> Ryabkov is cited as saying by Itar-Tass news agency. <em>“But we can’t leave this situation without reaction, without practical reaction, without reaction by means of our own decisions. US behavior in the field is becoming provocative.”</em> <br><br> According to the deputy FM, the American decision stems from a <em>“distorted and groundless</em>” assumption on the state of affairs in Ukraine. </p><p> Obama said the US and its allies would keep broader sanctions <em>“in reserve”</em> in the event of further escalation on the ground in Ukraine. He admitted that he was uncertain whether the latest round of measures would be effective. </p><p> <em>“The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally; the goal is to change his calculus, to encourage him to walk the walk, not just talk the talk</em>" on diplomacy to resolve the crisis, Obama said in Manila during a trip to Asia. </p><p> <a class="video-link-autoprocess" href="/files/news/25/eb/40/00/oliver_1600_480p.mp4">Video: /files/news/25/eb/40/00/oliver_1600_480p.mp4</a> </p><p> As the US pushes for more sanctions against Russia, EU members have preliminary agreed to also impose asset freezes and visa bans on 15 more people. The names of those to be added to the list will not be made public until they are published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, Reuters reported citing an unnamed diplomat source. However, Many Europeans opposed anti-Russian sanctions, which would target the economy as opposed to individuals close to the Russian leadership, since economic sanctions would hurt European economies as well as that of Russia. The US, being economically tied with Russia to a much lesser degree than Europe, says it would not impose economic sanctions <a href="http://rt.com/news/155168-us-eu-sanctions-russia/" target="_blank">unilaterally</a>. </p><p> <em>“I would be very surprised if all European countries found a common position on economic sanctions,”</em> Thierry Mariani, a member of the French National Assembly, told RT. <em>“When one country says ‘we don’t speak about finance’… and some other country says ‘we don’t speak about energy,’ then we don’t speak about anything. That’s why we arrive unfortunately [at] personal sanctions, which are completely nonsense.”</em> </p><p> Canada has also imposed sanctions on two Russian banks and nine individuals, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement announcing the measures on Monday. Harper's office did not immediately provide names. </p><p> The Russian leadership has thus far brushed off the threat of sanctions as ineffectual, arguing they might in fact buoy the Russian economy in the long term. </p><p> <em>“Overreliance can lead to a loss of sovereignty,”</em> Russian President <a href="http://rt.com/business/154576-sanctions-not-effective-putin/" target="_blank">Vladimir Putin said</a> at a media forum in St Petersburg on Thursday. </p><p> Western-led sanctions have several advantages for Russia, Putin said. </p><p> Putin said the threat of real economic sanctions is already bolstering domestic businesses, bringing more offshore funds back to Russia, and giving policymakers the push they need to establish a domestic payment system. </p><p> His comments <a href="http://rt.com/business/154012-sanctions-russia-stronger-medvedev/" target="_blank">echo sentiments</a> made by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev last week, who similarly argued that further sanctions would only make Russia stronger. </p><p> <em>“Thanks to Western sanctions, Russia has been given the incentive to reduce its dependence on outside and instead regional economies are being more self-sufficient,"</em> Medvedev said April 22. </p><p> Medvedev said any restrictions on Russian goods to the EU or US would serve to redirect Russian exports to Asian markets, which are more robust. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155352-putin-ukraine-defense-industry/</guid><title><![CDATA[End of defense imports to Russia would be catastrophe for Ukraine – Putin]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155352-putin-ukraine-defense-industry/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/80/00/putin-ukraine-defense-industry.jpg" title="Russian President Vladimir Putin (RIA Novosti/Alexei Druzhinin)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:56:29 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ed/80/00/putin-ukraine-defense-industry.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The end of defense industry cooperation between Kiev and Moscow due to the political crisis in Ukraine would lead the latter to a catastrophe, while Russia would be able to replace what it imports, President Putin has said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ed/80/00/putin-ukraine-defense-industry.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin (RIA Novosti/Alexei Druzhinin)" /> <p> <em>“Financially and technically Russia is able to conduct import substitution,”</em> Putin has said, adding that it won't require substantial funding. And this <em>“would not require a revision of the state defense order.”</em> </p><p> He estimated the whole process of import substitution for Russia would take between 1.5 and 2.5 years, depending on the type of the products. </p><p> <em>“But for the Ukrainian defense industry, the severing of ties with Russian partners is likely to lead to disaster,”</em> Putin said, speaking to the members of the Council of Lawmakers. <em>“Why? They don’t have any other markets. They just don’t exist. The only consumer is the Russian Armed Forces.”</em> </p><p> However, he expressed hope that <em>“rupture of these cooperation relations”</em> will not happen. </p><p> Still, Putin said he believes that such a halt to supplies is not a decision made <em>“directly by enterprises.”</em> </p><p> <em>"They [managers of these enterprises] understand perfectly in which situation Ukrainian government puts them. I’m sure, they would like to continue this cooperation,”</em> he said. </p><p> Earlier, Ukrainian First Vice-President Vitaly Yarema stated that the coup-appointed Ukrainian government had agreed to halt exports of weapons and military equipment to Russia. At the same time, he confirmed that deliveries of double-purpose (military and civil) products still continue. </p><p> Speaking of sanctions that the West is considering imposing on Russian industry sectors, and particularly the country’s military industrial complex, Putin stated that the measure, if taken, could be an attempt to prevent Russia from defense import substitution. </p><p> But, he said, <em>“This is an attempt with a bad means.”</em> </p><p> <em>“We will do that anyway,”</em> Putin emphasized. </p><p> Putin said that he has already ordered Russia’s government to examine the question of import substitution of the military-industrial complex’s products coming from Ukraine. </p><p> <em>“In any case, we are working on this now, I gave such an order to the government of the Russian Federation and they are actively working on it. [We are] studying all the issues related to import substitution,”</em> he said. </p><p> Russia will welcome specialists in the military-industrial complex from Ukraine, Putin said, vowing financial support to provide them with all necessities. </p><p> <em>“They will receive a worthy salary, and accommodation. [The regions] will receive all necessary means from the federal budget,"</em> Putin said. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155256-asian-economic-outlook-imf/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Japan and China threaten Asian economic growth - IMF]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155256-asian-economic-outlook-imf/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e7/80/00/asiat-economic-outlook-imf.jpg" title="Reuters/Toru Hanai"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:01:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e7/80/00/asiat-economic-outlook-imf.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Asian growth will remain steady at 5.4 percent in 2014, however a steeper than expected slowdown in China and a failure in Japan’s "Abenomics" program could derail the region’s economic progress, says the IMF.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e7/80/00/asiat-economic-outlook-imf.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Toru Hanai" /> <p> Asia also faces risks from outside the region, including improving growth in the US, which could raise global interest rates the new IMF <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2014/apd/eng/areo0414.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> said. </p><p> "<em>Bouts of capital flow and asset price volatility are likely along the way, with exchange rates, equity prices, and government bond yields affected by changes in global risk aversion and capital flows,</em>" the IMF concludes. </p><p> The IMF raised its growth forecast for Asia this year due to a pickup in external demand alongside a recovery in advanced economies. Growth is also expected to improve slightly to 5.5 percent in 2015. Last year, the region grew 5.2 percent. </p><p> However, the IMF predicts China will slowly decelerate to growth of 7.5 percent this year and 7.3 percent in 2015,to a "<em>more sustainable path</em>". </p><p> 2014 has been a <a href="http://rt.com/business/world-bank-china-growth-873/" target="_blank">bumpy start</a> for China, due to financial sector vulnerabilities, and the temporary cost of reforms, along with the transition toward a more sustainable growth path would have significant adverse regional spillover. </p><p> Domestic and global political tensions could also create trade disruptions and weaken investment and growth across the region. In some frontier economies, high credit growth has led to rising external and domestic vulnerabilities. </p><p> The IMF expects Japan's growth to decrease to 1 percent in 2015 from 1.4 percent this year, due to a reduction in the stimulus effects from monetary and fiscal easing.

" /> <p> Somehow the bullets and missiles that could still be used end up in a pile slated for destruction, and because a single weapons arsenal database has still not been worked out, an estimated $1.2 billion pile of ammo will go down the drain. So says a Government Accountability Office report obtained by USA Today. </p><p> The development of the database has been in the works for years, but different services have their own information systems, which to this day can’t share that information directly. The only department that has adopted a new system by the Pentagon is the Army. The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps are all using outdated ones. </p><p> Democrat Senator and Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tom Carper told USA Today that <em>“there is a huge opportunity to save millions, if not billions of dollars if the [Pentagon] can make some common-sense improvements to how it manages ammunition.”</em> </p><p> The senator added that <em>“despite years of effort, the Army, Navy and Air Force still don't have an efficient process for doing something as basic as sharing excess bullets. This Government Accountability Office (GAO) report clearly shows that our military's antiquated systems lead to millions of dollars in wasteful ammunition purchases.”</em> </p><p> The Pentagon has agreed that a need to automate the inventory reporting system should take center stage in future budgets. Although the study only covers peace-time arsenal accounting, one anonymous top military officer noted in an interview with USA Today that there were frequent shortages of 9mm handgun and .50-caliber machine gun ammo in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p><p> Among other things, the GAO report has found that even after annual meetings between the various military services, which attempt to redistribute the unused stockpile by sharing surplus data, ammunition that didn’t get discussed automatically gets the axe and is added to the pile for destruction. By comparison to the $1 billion wasted, the $70 million saved appears negligible. </p><p> To put things into perspective, the Army’s missile stockpile alone comprises $14 billion of the Department of Defense’s total of $70 billion in ammo under management. </p><p> A number of other shortfalls, such as that the Army only last year began to report on its unused missiles, adds greatly to the billion-dollar waste. The Army’s choice not to report on a bulk of its surplus ammunition results in other services buying fresh. Its reporting fails to mention ammo left over and stored from previous years. As authors point out, the study was on the eve of being released when other potential sources of bad information emerged. So those losses will not have been included. </p><p> Furthermore, tedious bureaucratic measures to do with sharing procedures result in computer orders for ammo made to the Army having to be entered into the system manually, raising the risk of clerical error. </p><p> In sum, the report appears to place much of the blame on the Army brushing everyone away with claims that they don’t have enough surplus ammo left over for redistribution annually. But without the Army’s active participation in this, <em>“other services [spend] additional funds to procure missiles that are already unused and usable in the Army’s stockpile.”</em> </p><p> The Army, following Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s and the GAO’s recommendations, has promised to do better and has already begun increasingly to share surplus ammo information with other services starting March. Previously, the service had not been contributing to the annual report at all. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155308-constitution-police-cellphones-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[Warrantless cellphone searches get hearing in Supreme Court]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155308-constitution-police-cellphones-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.jpg" title="Reuters/Gary Cameron"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:01:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Supreme Court will hear two cases – one involving a suspected drug dealer, the other a gang member – to determine the legality of police searching cellphones without a warrant at the time of an arrest.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Gary Cameron" /> <p> The landmark cases pit the Obama administration, still reeling from whistleblower Edward Snowden’s NSA revelations, against civil rights advocates who say police are conducting illegal search and seizures. <br><br> In the digital age, when about 90 percent of US citizens own cellphones and 58 percent have a smart phone, a legal battle is raging behind the scenes as to whether cellphones should be protected under the Fourth Amendment, which forbids <em>“unreasonable searches and seizures.”</em> Or should the technology become fair game for the police following an arrest? <br><br> The question will be considered in the case of David Leon Riley (<em>Riley v California</em> 13-1312), who was pulled over in San Diego in 2009 for driving with an expired license. After discovering guns in his car, the police found evidence on Riley’s Samsung smart phone that got him convicted on attempted murder charges. <br><br> The state of California rejected efforts by Riley’s attorney to toss out the use of the digital evidence. <br><br> In the other case (<em>United States v Wurie</em>, 13-212), Brima Wurie was arrested in Massachusetts for dealing drugs. Following a search of his cellphone’s call log, investigators found an address, where they discovered more illegal substances and a gun. Unlike the case of David Riley, Wurie had his sentence overturned when the court rejected the evidence retrieved from his phone. <br><br> Under the Fourth Amendment, police require a warrant based on <em>"probable cause"</em> before they can conduct a search. <br><br> In the past, the courts have granted police the authority to search the possessions of arrested individuals for two reasons: determining the individual is not carrying a weapon and preventing the destruction of evidence, like narcotics. <br><br> The question of cell phones, they argue, does not fit into either category. <br><br> Jeffrey Fisher, the lawyer for Riley, pointed to FBI statistics showing some 12 million Americans were arrested in 2012 alone, mostly over “minor crimes” like <em>"jaywalking, littering or riding a bicycle the wrong direction on a residential street,"</em> he said in his court filing. <br><br> It would be wrong, Fisher believes, that police would have the authority to search a person’s cellphone without first getting a court order to provide a warrant. </p><p> </p><p> <em>"The digital contents of a smart phone are categorically incapable of threatening officer safety. And once police have seized and secured a smart phone, there is no risk that the arrestee might destroy or alter its digital contents,"</em> Fisher continued. <br><br><em>"Such files hold exponentially greater amounts and types of sensitive personal information than any physical item."</em> <br><br> Civil rights watchdogs agree with that position. <br><br><em>"Cellphones and other portable electronic devices are, in effect, our new homes,"</em> the American Civil Liberties Union said in a court filing urging the Supreme Court to uphold the letter of the Fourth Amendment. <br><br> The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF argued on behalf of privacy, reminding that smart phones hold huge amounts of personal data. <br><br><em>"The breadth of that information would likely reveal an individual's medical history, religious beliefs, political affiliations, network of friends, colleagues, intimate associates, and acquaintances,"</em> as stated in a friend-of-the-court letter filed by EFF and others. <br><br> However, the Obama administration - and despite the criticism it received in the wake of the Snowden NSA leaks, which detailed a vast global surveillance system being used against friends and enemies alike - is in favor of granting police access to private data without a warrant. <br><br><em>"It is now common for drug deals to be arranged by cell phones, for violent street gangs to communicate through text messages, and for child abuse to be recorded on camera phones,"</em> the Justice Department stated in its court filings. <em>"In today's world, cell phones are particularly likely to contain evidence of unlawful activity and to help law-enforcement officers identify suspects they have apprehended."</em> <br><br> According to this argument, cellphones are no different from anything other possession a person may be carrying when arrested. <br><br><em>"Cellphones are now critical tools in the commission of crimes,"</em> said Donald Verrilli Jr., the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, AP reported. <br><br> Officials, however, are urging caution in coming to any quick conclusions in the case because the <em>“technology is changing rapidly,”</em> Attorney General of California Kamala Harris said in her court filing. <br><br> The court is expected to arrive at its conclusion in the cases by late June. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
