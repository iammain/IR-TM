Growth is also expected to improve slightly to 5.5 percent in 2015. Last year, the region grew 5.2 percent. </p><p> However, the IMF predicts China will slowly decelerate to growth of 7.5 percent this year and 7.3 percent in 2015,to a "<em>more sustainable path</em>". </p><p> 2014 has been a <a href="http://rt.com/business/world-bank-china-growth-873/" target="_blank">bumpy start</a> for China, due to financial sector vulnerabilities, and the temporary cost of reforms, along with the transition toward a more sustainable growth path would have significant adverse regional spillover. </p><p> Domestic and global political tensions could also create trade disruptions and weaken investment and growth across the region. In some frontier economies, high credit growth has led to rising external and domestic vulnerabilities. </p><p> The IMF expects Japan's growth to decrease to 1 percent in 2015 from 1.4 percent this year, due to a reduction in the stimulus effects from monetary and fiscal easing. Another barrier towards growth will be a need to reduce debt, the outlook said. </p><p> Abenomics is Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s plan to stoke the economy and spur growth after decades of decline, with a commitment to keep the yen weak. </p><p> Meanwhile, the IMF says a pickup in external demand coupled with a recovery in advanced economies and resilient domestic demand should contribute to growth across most of the region. </p><p> "<em>The advanced economies are turning a corner and many Asian economies which depend on exports as a main growth engine are in a good position to capitalize on the recovery. That's the main reason why we are positive on the Asian region,</em>" CNBC quotes Changyong Rhee, the director of Asia and Pacific Department at the IMF. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155248-pentagon-arsenal-waste-billion/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pentagon wastes $1bn worth of ammo due to outdated reporting system]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155248-pentagon-arsenal-waste-billion/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e7/00/00/pentagon-arsenal-waste-billion.jpg" title="Reuters/Saad Shalash&#10;"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:01:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e7/00/00/pentagon-arsenal-waste-billion.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Pentagon has wasted a billion dollars’ worth of ammunition because its inventory reporting system isn’t up to scratch, with inaccurate accounting and no effective information sharing mechanism in place to point out vast unused reserves of ammunition.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e7/00/00/pentagon-arsenal-waste-billion.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Saad Shalash
" /> <p> Somehow the bullets and missiles that could still be used end up in a pile slated for destruction, and because a single weapons arsenal database has still not been worked out, an estimated $1.2 billion pile of ammo will go down the drain. So says a Government Accountability Office report obtained by USA Today. </p><p> The development of the database has been in the works for years, but different services have their own information systems, which to this day can’t share that information directly. The only department that has adopted a new system by the Pentagon is the Army. The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps are all using outdated ones. </p><p> Democrat Senator and Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tom Carper told USA Today that <em>“there is a huge opportunity to save millions, if not billions of dollars if the [Pentagon] can make some common-sense improvements to how it manages ammunition.”</em> </p><p> The senator added that <em>“despite years of effort, the Army, Navy and Air Force still don't have an efficient process for doing something as basic as sharing excess bullets. This Government Accountability Office (GAO) report clearly shows that our military's antiquated systems lead to millions of dollars in wasteful ammunition purchases.”</em> </p><p> The Pentagon has agreed that a need to automate the inventory reporting system should take center stage in future budgets. Although the study only covers peace-time arsenal accounting, one anonymous top military officer noted in an interview with USA Today that there were frequent shortages of 9mm handgun and .50-caliber machine gun ammo in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p><p> Among other things, the GAO report has found that even after annual meetings between the various military services, which attempt to redistribute the unused stockpile by sharing surplus data, ammunition that didn’t get discussed automatically gets the axe and is added to the pile for destruction. By comparison to the $1 billion wasted, the $70 million saved appears negligible. </p><p> To put things into perspective, the Army’s missile stockpile alone comprises $14 billion of the Department of Defense’s total of $70 billion in ammo under management. </p><p> A number of other shortfalls, such as that the Army only last year began to report on its unused missiles, adds greatly to the billion-dollar waste. The Army’s choice not to report on a bulk of its surplus ammunition results in other services buying fresh. Its reporting fails to mention ammo left over and stored from previous years. As authors point out, the study was on the eve of being released when other potential sources of bad information emerged. So those losses will not have been included. </p><p> Furthermore, tedious bureaucratic measures to do with sharing procedures result in computer orders for ammo made to the Army having to be entered into the system manually, raising the risk of clerical error. </p><p> In sum, the report appears to place much of the blame on the Army brushing everyone away with claims that they don’t have enough surplus ammo left over for redistribution annually. But without the Army’s active participation in this, <em>“other services [spend] additional funds to procure missiles that are already unused and usable in the Army’s stockpile.”</em> </p><p> The Army, following Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s and the GAO’s recommendations, has promised to do better and has already begun increasingly to share surplus ammo information with other services starting March. Previously, the service had not been contributing to the annual report at all. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155308-constitution-police-cellphones-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pleading the 4th: Supreme Court to hear cellphone v police power cases]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155308-constitution-police-cellphones-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.jpg" title="Reuters/Gary Cameron"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:01:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Supreme Court will hear two cases – one involving a suspected drug dealer, the other a gang member – to determine the legality of police searching cellphones without a warrant at the time of an arrest.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ea/c0/00/constitution-police-cellphones-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Gary Cameron" /> <p> The landmark cases pit the Obama administration, still reeling from whistleblower Edward Snowden’s NSA revelations, against civil rights advocates who say police are conducting illegal search and seizures. <br><br> In the digital age, when about 90 percent of US citizens own cellphones and 58 percent have a smart phone, a legal battle is raging behind the scenes as to whether cellphones should be protected under the Fourth Amendment, which forbids <em>“unreasonable searches and seizures.”</em> Or should the technology become fair game for the police following an arrest? <br><br> The question will be considered in the case of David Leon Riley (<em>Riley v California</em> 13-1312), who was pulled over in San Diego in 2009 for driving with an expired license. After discovering guns in his car, the police found evidence on Riley’s Samsung smart phone that got him convicted on attempted murder charges. <br><br> The state of California rejected efforts by Riley’s attorney to toss out the use of the digital evidence. <br><br> In the other case (<em>United States v Wurie</em>, 13-212), Brima Wurie was arrested in Massachusetts for dealing drugs. Following a search of his cellphone’s call log, investigators found an address, where they discovered more illegal substances and a gun. Unlike the case of David Riley, Wurie had his sentence overturned when the court rejected the evidence retrieved from his phone. <br><br> Under the Fourth Amendment, police require a warrant based on <em>"probable cause"</em> before they can conduct a search. <br><br> In the past, the courts have granted police the authority to search the possessions of arrested individuals for two reasons: determining the individual is not carrying a weapon and preventing the destruction of evidence, like narcotics. <br><br> The question of cell phones, they argue, does not fit into either category. <br><br> Jeffrey Fisher, the lawyer for Riley, pointed to FBI statistics showing some 12 million Americans were arrested in 2012 alone, mostly over “minor crimes” like <em>"jaywalking, littering or riding a bicycle the wrong direction on a residential street,"</em> he said in his court filing. <br><br> It would be wrong, Fisher believes, that police would have the authority to search a person’s cellphone without first getting a court order to provide a warrant. </p><p> </p><p> <em>"The digital contents of a smart phone are categorically incapable of threatening officer safety. And once police have seized and secured a smart phone, there is no risk that the arrestee might destroy or alter its digital contents,"</em> Fisher continued. <br><br><em>"Such files hold exponentially greater amounts and types of sensitive personal information than any physical item."</em> <br><br> Civil rights watchdogs agree with that position. <br><br><em>"Cellphones and other portable electronic devices are, in effect, our new homes,"</em> the American Civil Liberties Union said in a court filing urging the Supreme Court to uphold the letter of the Fourth Amendment. <br><br> The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF argued on behalf of privacy, reminding that smart phones hold huge amounts of personal data. <br><br><em>"The breadth of that information would likely reveal an individual's medical history, religious beliefs, political affiliations, network of friends, colleagues, intimate associates, and acquaintances,"</em> as stated in a friend-of-the-court letter filed by EFF and others. <br><br> However, the Obama administration - and despite the criticism it received in the wake of the Snowden NSA leaks, which detailed a vast global surveillance system being used against friends and enemies alike - is in favor of granting police access to private data without a warrant. <br><br><em>"It is now common for drug deals to be arranged by cell phones, for violent street gangs to communicate through text messages, and for child abuse to be recorded on camera phones,"</em> the Justice Department stated in its court filings. <em>"In today's world, cell phones are particularly likely to contain evidence of unlawful activity and to help law-enforcement officers identify suspects they have apprehended."</em> <br><br> According to this argument, cellphones are no different from anything other possession a person may be carrying when arrested. <br><br><em>"Cellphones are now critical tools in the commission of crimes,"</em> said Donald Verrilli Jr., the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, AP reported. <br><br> Officials, however, are urging caution in coming to any quick conclusions in the case because the <em>“technology is changing rapidly,”</em> Attorney General of California Kamala Harris said in her court filing. <br><br> The court is expected to arrive at its conclusion in the cases by late June. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155320-kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Mayor of Kharkov, Ukraine shot in back, hospitalized - press service]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155320-kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/80/00/kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine.jpg" title="Kharkov Mayor Gennady Kernes (RIA Novosti/Chekachkov Igor)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:32:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/eb/80/00/kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov, Gennady Kernes, has been shot in the back by unidentified gunmen, the city council’s press service reports.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/80/00/kharkov-mayor-shot-ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Kharkov Mayor Gennady Kernes (RIA Novosti/Chekachkov Igor)" /> <p> At about 11:30 am (8:30 GMT) local time Kernes was taken to the local hospital. The City Hall's website says that doctors are fighting to save his life. </p><p> <em>“They shot him in the back from the forest,”</em> Kernes’s friend Yury Sapronov told Vesti Ukrainy news outlet. <em>“The injury is serious. His lung is pierced and his liver pierced all the way through.”</em> </p><p> Kernes was shot while cycling, according to conflicting media reports, Yury Sidorenko from the mayor’s press service told RT. The doctors are currently operating, he added. </p><p> Sidorenko said he did not have any information about whether Kernes had regained consciousness. </p><p> </p><p> He declined to comment about who was behind the shooting. He only said that Kernes “has been recently receiving a lot of threats from various people.” </p><p> According to the doctor treating Kernes, his wound is serious as his diaphragm has been damaged. </p><p> A mayor of Kharkov since March 2010, Kernes had been a strong supporter of President Viktor Yanukovich right till his ouster in February. Since then he supported the new Ukrainian authorities and kept his position. </p><p> The shooting comes a day after ultranationalists clashed with anti-government protesters in the city, leaving 14 people injured. </p><p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/puG2Wn6wJA4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p><p> Meanwhile, Ukrainian presidential candidate Oleg Tsarev condemned the attack on the Kharkov mayor. He said that despite his and Kernes’ political rivalry, the attack outraged him. </p><p> <em>“Shooting at the politicians is wrong. Once again it shows that it is impossible to hold presidential elections until we reach consensus and civil peace,”</em> he added. </p><p> Kharkov mayor and Party of Regions member Gennady Kernes was born June 27, 1959, in Kharkov, then in the Ukrainian SSR. He is a lawyer and manager by profession. </p><p> A miner in the late 70s, Kernes moved to working for state institutions and other enterprises in the 80s. His first foray into politics came in 1998, when he ran for the Kharkov City Council. That paved the way for a career in politics, resulting in the creation of the political group New Kharkov – New Possibilities, followed by a civil movement of the same name, which gained widespread popularity among citizens. </p><p> This led him to become secretary of the City Council for the second time in 2002, with the support of 90 percent of Kharkov’s population. This was after a brief period as deputy director of the Kharkov branch of the Trading House Gas of Ukraine until 2001. </p><p> In 2004, Kernes was an enthusiastic supporter of the Orange Revolution. Political alliances secured him the mayor’s post on October 31, 2010, after Mikhail Dobkin had become head of the regional state administration. The results, which were overwhelmingly in his favor again, were controversial and came under suspicion from critics. During his tenure as mayor, he has become well known among locals for his far-reaching city reforms and his contributions to development and charitable causes. </p><p> However, Kernes’s past is also entangled with Ukraine’s underworld – among other things, he was allegedly the boss of his own criminal organization, which gained notoriety in the region. He was also convicted of theft and fraud. </p><p> Since the February 2014 coup in Ukraine, he has been accused of fomenting separatism. In January, he gave himself a controversial 25 percent pay rise. </p><p> Kernes was awarded many political honors in his time. He is a father of three children. His hobbies, among other things, include actively promoting and leading a healthy lifestyle. </p><p> Thousands of anti-government demonstrations have swept eastern Ukraine since March, with administration buildings being seized in several cities, including Kharkov, the largest city. </p><p> At the beginning of March some 111 people were injured in clashes between anti-government protesters and radical nationalists in the city after the radical groups then seized the administration building. Commenting on the incident, Mayor Kernes said they were ultra nationalist elements <em>“who hid their faces behind masks and had weapons, including automatic ones,”</em> adding that <em>“it turned out that these men came from western Ukraine – from Lvov, Ivano-Frankovsk.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155300-gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Russia not obliged to finance Ukraine-EU integration’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155300-gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/40/00/gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu.jpg" title="A worker stands near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:19:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/40/00/gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Since the moment Ukraine chose to become an independent state, it has had to accept that it can’t develop as a country at the cost of Russian taxpayers, Anna Van Densky, political commentator from the EU Reporter Magazine, told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/40/00/gas-problems-ukraine-russia-eu.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A worker stands near pipes at a gas compressor station in the Ukrainian settlement of Orlovka, about 280 km (174 miles) west of the Black Sea port of Odessa (Reuters)" /> <p> Speaking about Russian gas, Van Densky said that Europe needs it badly for its development, while this commodity is taken hostage because of the political contradictions and ambitions over Ukrainian crisis. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> H<em>as the gas supply to Europe ever been as threatened as it is now?</em> </p><p> <strong>Anna Van Densky:</strong> It has always been a problem like that because after the collapse of the Soviet Union it was very difficult for the Ukrainian leadership to come to the terms that independence has its own price and if Ukraine is an independent state. They have to pay for gas as for any other commodity. Now of course it’s not the first so-called gas war because, unfortunately, gas transit was used on many occasions as an instrument of political pressure. </p><p> That what we see now, because now the supplies to Europe are also threatened, that’s why the South Stream corridor is so crucial to stabilize gas supplies to Europeans, because we had the situation with crisis in 2006, 2009. It’s a system that should be really reconstructed, rebuilt in another way, and that’s why it’s ideal for Ukrainians themselves also to have different view on the energy so that they could also open a broad gate to green energy, for example, alternative energy, wind energy, etc. So this dependency on transit of Russian gas is also unhealthy for the Ukrainian state, for Ukrainians, because unfortunately there were many parasites around this easy money. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Is South Stream pipeline really necessary? Surely it would be cheaper to work out a proper, long term deal with Ukraine? What do you think?</em> </p><p> <strong>AD:</strong> There are a lot of details that are very ambivalent. First of all, in any supplies it’s much better to have multiple ways than one way, so it’s not only for political reasons. There can be other reasons like a catastrophe. The problem of supply isn’t dependent on Ukrainians as such. [The] more routes, [the] more secure it is. That’s why you talk all the time about diversifying the ways of gas. South Stream is an ideal way because it goes from Russia through Black Sea and it comes to Bulgaria, it comes directly to the EU. So it’s one of the ways, it’s not about cutting gas, Russian gas, from [going] through Ukraine, it’s just diminishing this route and giving other alternative routes and opportunity. It’s also very fashionable because it will open real opportunities for the other alternative to Ukrainians, like green energy, for example. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> U<em>kraine still wants heavily discounted gas prices. Is that a fair request?</em> </p><p> <strong>AD:</strong> It’s not a fair request, no. It comes from the Soviet era, because once upon a time Soviet Union was basically one state. Asking for this price is absolutely ridiculous in the situation of being an independent state and buying a commodity. It’s a confusion and this confusion caused a lot of political problems afterwards as well, because the moment Ukraine or Ukrainian people chose to become an independent state, they had to accept that they can’t develop their country on cost of Russian taxpayers, because they are the citizens of other countries. That’s the way it goes. </p><p> So it’s a lot of political confusion now as well, because if Europeans would like to help Ukrainians they have to sit together with Russians at the negotiation table and find out the way to help them to pay their bills, because it would be very naïve to expect that Russian taxpayers are obliged to finance Ukrainian integration into the EU. </p><p> So it’s not the way the things work. Unfortunately, all the revolutions are very anti-democratic because now the decisions are in the hands of a very small group of people, they were not elected democratically. I personally hope that after the real democratic elections there will be new leaders who will accept a fair and modern-style relationship with Russia. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Isn't Russia's reputation as a reliable energy supplier is now a hostage to Kiev's political whims? Is there any solution?</em> </p><p> <strong>AD:</strong> The South Stream is an ideal solution basically because it goes from Russia through the Black Sea and to Europe. It will help Europe because European needs gas badly, for example, Italy wants to develop southern Italy, and it would be a great opportunity for the economies of the south to get Russian gas. Let’s not forget that gas remains the most ecological among all types of energy. So it’s good for Europe, it’s good for [the] economy and it’s very sad that such a commodity is taken hostage because of these political contradictions and ambitions. </p><p> It’s especially important to have South Stream corridor as a solution to diversify the ways of gas to Europe. The latest Ukrainian Maidan revolution is not the first one, there was also the Orange Revolution and the hope was flying high, but it didn’t deliver it and it ended in a second revolution, Maidan. When the situation will be stabilizing in Ukraine nobody really knows. We hope it will be stabilized soon. Anyway, I think that European and Russians, the taxpayers from both sides can’t be taken hostage of this political instability in Ukraine, so the South Stream and Nord Stream, maybe other pipeline like Yamal, will help to create real strategic partnership and well-being of the people. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/155292-russia-veterans-ombudsman-law/</guid><title><![CDATA[Leftist MP suggests establishing veterans’ ombudsman post]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/155292-russia-veterans-ombudsman-law/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e9/c0/00/russia-veterans-ombudsman-law.jpg" title="RIA Novosti/Evgeny Biyatov"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:16:05 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e9/c0/00/russia-veterans-ombudsman-law.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A Russian lawmaker holds that the country needs an official who would protect the veterans’ rights and help them cope with the rapidly changing laws and shifts in national economy.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e9/c0/00/russia-veterans-ombudsman-law.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="RIA Novosti/Evgeny Biyatov" /> <p> Oleg Mikheyev of the center-left Fair Russia party has addressed the government and the Public Chamber with a request to institute the post of plenipotentiary for veterans’ issues, or the veterans’ ombudsman, the RIA Novosti reported on Monday.

(AFP Photo / Crown Copyright)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why this urgent need for Russian-speaking agents in British intelligence? <br></em> </p><p> <strong>Annie Machon:</strong> Well it is interesting timing, I think, because for the last 5 or 6 years British intelligence has said that one of the biggest threats is Russian espionage in London. But now I think we're looking into situation where obviously post Russia infringe in Syria, stopping an illegal rush to war by the West in Syria, post the Ukraine, post Crimea and also of course post Edward Snowden and giving him asylum last year – I think that is an indication that the West is ramping up its interventionism and its investigation into Russian activity in the West. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>You have said this all smacks of the Cold War. Are the latest tensions between Moscow and the West really that bad?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> One would hope not. After the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a huge rapprochement between the West and the East, and I remember the former head of MI5 Dame Stella Rimington went across and worked with and spoke with her counterpart in Russia in the early 1990s to share information, to share working methodologies because the end of the war had occurred. </p><p> So it's rather worrying that the UK is now ramping-up their perceived risk around what they are doing with the Russian espionage aspect. But it is a shame, because I think Europe should be working together, Europe should not be dividing itself in the way they are doing at the dictate of the US. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The job ad on MI5's website says, “Your work will enable us to take a well-informed view of potential threats to national security, including terrorism and espionage.” Does this mean the UK thinks such threats could come from Russia?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> Well that is a very good question, because the job of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, the three primary intelligence agencies in the UK is to defend national security and the economic well-being of the state. </p><p> Now, national security has never been legally defined under the UK law. So we have a situation where it can be abused, used, reinterpreted whatever the government, or the intelligence agencies or the British establishment want to choose to say is national security. </p><p> I would suggest that what the British need to do is take a step back and say: “What is our national security? What is the threat to it? Is it the integrity of our nation such as we faced in WWII with the potential Nazi invasion? And if that is the case, how do we best protect it, how do we best police it?” </p><p> And of course in Britain, we have a very British mess, where we have a 100 year cycle of British intelligence agencies evolving and taking on the work, and just been giving jobs for the boys. </p><p> So I think for Britain, it would be good if they can step back and say what is the threat, and how do we best protect ourselves and how then we can structure our intelligence response, rather than just say: “This week we are a bit worried about this, we are a bit worried about this threat this year.” It is just a reaction rather than a pro-active and creative response to the threat to our nation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>For this job, MI5 will only consider Brits who have lived in the UK for the past 9 years, and whose parents are also British. Whom are these requirements supposed to rule out?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> One of the requirement to work for the British intelligence agencies is that you have to be British by nationality, and also I think you have to have grandparents, at least two that are British as well. So they are trying to ensure that people have a certain tie to the country, I suppose. But in this day and age of multiculturalism and everything, it becomes extremely difficult to adhere to that. </p><p> And it is interesting as well looking back over the last century that people who have been deemed to be traitors by the UK, who have gone over to what used to be Soviet side, who were allowed to leave the country and not get prosecuted under the espionage act of the early 20th century, tended to be the establishment. So there seems to be one rule for the generals and one rule for the infantry. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Is it just a coincidence that the need for experts on Russia comes at a time when Europe and the US are blaming Moscow for the current unrest in Ukraine?</em> </p><p> <strong>AM:</strong> Well I think it is a bit rich for the West to say Russia is trying ferment the resistance within eastern Ukraine, when it appears that the West and EU have been trying to ferment resistance in western Ukraine before the original revolution that deposed the president. </p><p> I also find it interesting that the US president is trying to lecture Russia and say that “we have to go by the democratic rules” and things like that. That is precisely what has happened in Crimea. That is precisely what has not happened in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, so these sort of double standards are very troubling. </p><p> Either we adhere to international law, democracy and the rules around this. And I think this was what was done in Crimea. That is I want to see done in most of the Middle East and North Africa and Central Asia, or we don't. And for America to lecture one way and do just the other thing on the other side is not acceptable. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155240-tornado-damage-injuries-states/</guid><title><![CDATA[Casualties, massive damage as multiple tornadoes rip through US]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155240-tornado-damage-injuries-states/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e6/80/00/tornado.jpg" title="A low-level thunderstorm supercell passes over the area of Hampton, Arkansas (Reuters / Gene Blevins)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:40:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e6/80/00/tornado.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A powerful tornado storm system has ripped through several US states, killing one person in Oklahoma and at least 16 others in central Arkansas while causing major damage in the Great Plains, Midwest and Southern states.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e6/80/00/tornado.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A low-level thunderstorm supercell passes over the area of Hampton, Arkansas (Reuters / Gene Blevins)" /> <p> A tornado killed one person in Quapaw, a small residence in Oklahoma, on the border of Kansas and Missouri, authorities announced, saying the storm struck the town around 5:30pm local time. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> My hometown sustained a direct <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tornado&amp;src=hash">#tornado</a> hit.

The event was also shown in 3D at hundreds of cinemas across the world and was tweeted live by the Vatican's vicariate of Rome under the hashtag #2popesaints. <br><br><em>"We are followers of all four popes who have all been close to the people. This is an historic day but one that you really feel inside,"</em> Luisa Tomolo, a member of an Italian religious movement, told AP. <br><br> The crowd was nearly half kilometer-long as it stretched back along all of Via della Conciliazione, boulevard in the center of Rome. One of the pilgrims was holding a banner saying "Two pope saints in heaven, two in St Peter's Square". </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Foto del día: momento en que <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Benedicto&amp;src=hash">#Benedicto</a> XVI llega a plaza san Pedro para misa de canonizaciones <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%232popesaints&amp;src=hash"> #2popesaints</a> <a href="http://t.co/VeEBNZvzsH">pic.twitter.com/VeEBNZvzsH</a> </p> <p> — JorgeEnriqueMújicaLC (@web_pastor) <a href="https://twitter.com/web_pastor/statuses/460335630296174592">April 27, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> </p><p> Meanwhile, some people waited for more than 12 hours along the main street before police opened up St Peter's Square at 05:30 a.m. local time (04:30 GMT). <br><br> Many world leaders also arrived to commemorate two prominent figures of Catholic Church. <br><br> According to Vatican’s press service, at least 98 foreign delegations attended the ceremony. <br><br> High levels of security were reported.

The acceleration of his sainthood, the fastest since the 18th century, was also considered controversial. <br><br> Another canonized Pope, John XXIII, an Italian, known as the <em>“Good Pope”</em> due to his friendly character is famous for launching a process of reform of the Catholic Church in 1962. An advocate for human rights, he often expressed his views on equality saying <em>“We were all made in God's image, and thus, we are all Godly alike.”</em> <br><br> As an Apostolic Nuncio to France (envoy from the Roman Catholic Church), John XXIII saved thousands of Jews during World War II. <br><br><em>“I feel very happy because both of them inspire us,”</em> Father Emmanuel Emeka, a priest from Nigeria, told Reuters. <em>“I think both of them have a lot to teach us.”</em> </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> La Chiesa di Dio, sotto il cielo di Roma! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%232popesaints&amp;src=hash">#2popesaints</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SanGiovanniPaoloII&amp;src=hash"> #SanGiovanniPaoloII</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sangiovannixxiii&amp;src=hash"> #sangiovannixxiii</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PapaFrancesco&amp;src=hash">#PapaFrancesco</a><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Roma&amp;src=hash">#Roma</a><a href="http://t.co/XwoYwx3dn0">pic.twitter.com/XwoYwx3dn0</a> </p> <p> — Sabrina (@Sabrinat_witter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sabrinat_witter/statuses/460363044854710272"> April 27, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Los obispos se van, yo también.

(Reuters / Amer Alfaj) " /> <p> Over 92 percent of Syria's chemical stockpile has been removed from the country, Sigrid Kaag head of the combined Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-UN task team told a news conference at the Damascus-based Four Seasons Hotel on Sunday. </p><p> <em>"(Also) a total of 18 removal operations have been carried out ...and always with due regard for the environment and public safety,"</em> she added. <br><br> In addition to the removal, Damascus has destroyed buildings, equipment, empty mustard gas containers, and decontaminated other containers at several chemical weapons storage and production sites. <br><br><em>“We are talking basically of the remaining seven and a half, eight percent of chemicals weapons material that currently still in country in one particular site. Six and a half, roughly, needs to be removed, a small percentage is to be destroyed regardless in country that can be done,"</em> she said. <br><br> The watchdog added that the Syrian government has been very cooperative after joining the Chemical Weapons Convention, however it needs to <em>"acquit itself of its commitments"</em> and ensure the remaining materials are eradicated by the end of the month. <br><br><em>“It's important that the last push is made toward full completion,''</em> Kaag said. <br><br> Damascus pledged to remove all chemicals by April 13, except for those in areas <em>“that are presently inaccessible,”</em> by an April-27 deadline, according to the OPCW. So far the deadlines have not been met, because of the unstable situation inside the country. </p><p> </p><p> Kaag said on Sunday that the joint OPCW-UN mission has been receiving information from Damascus about attacks on convoys transferring weapons, Syrian SANA news agency reported. <br><br><em>“Syria is a country at war. The security situation is volatile, precarious and it shifts all the time,”</em> Kagg told RT adding that security remains always a challenge and the situation should be addressed <em>“to avoid the risk of any of the chemical weapons materials falling in the wrong hands”. <br></em> <br> Kaag said the mission has not yet been given access to 12 chemical weapons production facilities. These facilities are under review by the OPCW Executive Council regarding the modalities for their destruction. <br><br> In March Russia urged the provision of security of chemical weapons transportation pointing to the March 9 attack on the port at Latakia. The chemicals are being transported there and loaded onto Norwegian and Danish ships for transport to the Italian port Gioia Tauro. There the weapons will be transferred to a ship and turned into low-toxicity effluent. <br><br><em>“Three rockets were fired towards the ships [transporting the weapons]”</em> in a <em>“purposeful act of sabotage”</em> that constitutes a “flagrant violation” of UN regulations, said a statement from the Russian foreign ministry. <br><br> In February, Damascus said there were two attempted attacks on convoys with chemical weapons. The OPCW inspectors have also been fired upon by snipers in autumn of 2013. Mortar bombs landed near their hotel in Damascus, however it was not clear whether they had been targeted. <br><br> Moscow stressed the Syrian government cannot take all responsibility for chemical weapons removal. <br><br> Syria agreed to the destruction of its chemical weapons through a US-Russia brokered deal in September. The decision was sparked by a deadly sarin gas attack in August 21 near Damascus that killed hundreds of people. The West blamed President Bashar Assad forces for it, while Damascus accused the rebels. <br><br> Syria has declared around 700 tons of the most-dangerous chemicals, 500 tons of less-dangerous precursor chemicals and 122 tons of isopropanol used in sarin gas production. The deadline for the mission’s completion is June 30. Kaag told reporters in Damascus on Sunday that the UN hoped Syria would meet it. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155208-mars-water-flowing-space/</guid><title><![CDATA[Water was flowing on Mars 200,000 years ago – scientists]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155208-mars-water-flowing-space/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e4/80/00/mars-20090529-browse.jpg" title="Photo Credit: NASA"/><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 18:11:28 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e4/80/00/mars-20090529-browse.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />New research has suggested that water was flowing across the surface of Mars some 200,000 years ago.

However, the young age of the crater means the features signifying water must have appeared since. <br><br> The scientists drew comparisons between the geomorphological land formations and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. The crater had features of areas on earth where debris flow had caused material to be deposited by fast-flowing water. <br><br><em>“Our fieldwork on Svalbard confirmed our interpretation of the Martian deposits,”</em> stated Andreas Johnsson, a spokesperson for the research team. <br><br><em>“Our study crater on Mars is far too young to have been influenced by the conditions that were prevalent then. This suggests that the meltwater-related processes that formed these deposits have been exceptionally effective also in more recent times,”</em> said Johnsson. <br><br><em>“If we find on Mars evidence for a second genesis, that changes everything,”</em> Johnsson added. <br><br> A debris flow takes place when liquid water soaks through debris lying on an incline to the point that it becomes saturated and heavy, causing it to descend down the incline. <br><br> On earth, debris flow can result in material destruction and sometimes casualties, depending upon their severity. <br><br> When the flow stops, new landforms are made, including lobate deposits and paired levees. It is these that Johnsson has identified on the planet. <br><br><em>“Gullies are common on Mars, but the ones which have been studied previously are older, and the sediments where they have formed are associated with the most recent ice age. Our study crater on Mars is far too young to have been influenced by the conditions that were prevalent then,”</em> Johnson said. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155204-ukraine-protesters-tv-station/</guid><title><![CDATA[Anti-govt protesters seize TV station in eastern Ukraine, call for own channel]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155204-ukraine-protesters-tv-station/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e4/40/00/000_par7864681.jpg" title="Activists stand guard outside a regional television station after it was seized by pro-Russian separatists, in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on April 27, 2014.

Itar-Tass reports that some Russian TV channels have resumed work in Donetsk. </p><p> <em>“Their experts are now setting up equipment on our frequency to broadcast Russian TV channels,”</em> TV station CEO Oleg Dzholos told Ukraine’s Channel 5, Interfax-Ukraine reported. </p><p> One of the protesters has told the news agency that “Russia 24” channel is already broadcasting instead of local “Channel 27”. </p><p> Protesters have left the building, but still left their security there. </p><p> <em>“Nobody freed the TV station – protesters left, but there is our security there as well as our technicians and the station’s crew,”</em> an unnamed man told Interfax-Ukraine. </p><p> </p><p> It has also been reported that pro-Russian protesters held talks with the TV center's executives to begin broadcasting the “Donetsk People's Republic” television channel. </p><p> <em>“There were many demands.

There were experts and they understood me. The following demand was – not a demand, an ultimatum – to switch on, if I am not mistaken, Russia-24 TV channel,”</em> Dzholos said. </p><p> So far, all Ukrainian TV channels continue their broadcast. </p><p> Protesters entered the TV station late Sunday afternoon, saying they were unsatisfied with the way the situation in the region was covered in local news and shows. Protesters demanded that Ukrainian channels be blocked. </p><p> They have taken down the Ukrainian flag from the TV station’s office and hoisted the flag of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. It was also taken down later. </p><p> </p><p> Protesters brought satellite antennas and other equipment and placed guards at the entrance to the television center, Itar-Tass reported. </p><p> Prior to taking control of the TV station, over 3,000 people gathered at Donetsk's central Lenin Square.

Amid massive protests, when a number of government building were stormed and seized by anti-government activists, Kiev launched an “anti-terrorist” military operation targeting rallying civilians. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155176-mers-spread-saudi-arabia/</guid><title><![CDATA[MERS spreading: Saudi Arabia registers 26 more cases after Egypt discovers first patient]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155176-mers-spread-saudi-arabia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e2/80/00/000_nic6315648.jpg" title="Saudi women leave the emergency department at a hospital in the center of the Saudi capital Riyadh.

On Sunday the country confirmed a further 26 cases, bringing the number to 323. </p><p> <br> On Sunday, eight more deaths were reported. One-hundred-and-two of all MERS cases in the country have so far been fatal. The death rate for the illness stands at approximately 40 percent, and since the beginning of April cases have spiked with a 65 percent jump – 143 cases have been announced this month alone. <br><br> On Saturday, a 27-year-old Egyptian man was discovered to have contracted the disease. He had recently returned from Saudi Arabia and is currently being treated at a Cairo hospital, and is reportedly in a stable condition. <br><br> Shortly after the case was reported, a WHO spokesman stated that it was <em>“concerned”</em> about the rising numbers of people suffering from the disease. <br><br> Last Tuesday, it was reported that Greece’s first confirmed MERS patient was in critical condition, according to doctors. The same day, Saudi Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabiah was sacked shortly after visiting a hospital in Jeddah – the main gateway to the Islamic holy city of Mecca, in the country’s west – which he was visiting in order to alleviate heightened public fear over the virus. Many Saudis have been expressing heightened concern on social media. </p><p> Three centers have now been set up by Saudi Arabia to deal with the outbreak of the disease. </p><p> <em>“This step comes as part of an emergency plan aiming to contain the spread of the virus,”</em> acting Health Minister Adel Faqih, said on Saturday, according to Saudi Press Agency. </p><p> The centers are reportedly located in the Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Hospital in Riyadh, King Abdullah Medical Complex in Jeddah, and Dammam Medical Complex in the Eastern Province, <br><br> MERS is a SARS-like disease which kills approximately one-third of people that become infected. There is currently no cure for it. <br><br> While the illness is compared to SARS, it is still in the process of being researched by experts. SARS exploded across Asia in 2003, infecting 8,273 people – nine percent of whom died. MERS is thought to be deadlier but more difficult to transmit. A February study suggested that camels are the major source of the disease, although previous studies said that it originated in bats. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155196-bahrain-police-killing-sentences/</guid><title><![CDATA[Bahrain hands down life sentences to 8 activists over policeman’s killing]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155196-bahrain-police-killing-sentences/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e3/c0/00/000_ts-nic6320929.jpg" title="A Bahraini protestor throws a tear gas canister back at riot police during clashes following a protest condemning the death of Ahmed Al-Mosajen and Ali Abbas, in the village of Al-Maqsha, west of Manama, on April 25, 2014.

The men were found guilty of planting a homemade bomb close to where police usually set up checkpoints during protests. They were then accused of setting tires ablaze and blocking the road to lure security forces to the area. </p><p> One policeman was killed and four others were wounded in the ensuing blast, the prosecutor said. </p><p> The men were also found guilty of illegally taking part in anti-government protests in the northern village of Dair in August 2013. </p><p> The defendants, however, said they had made their confessions under torture. </p><p> In late March, 13 Bahrainis, some of them teenagers, were also jailed for life after being found guilty of attempting to kill policemen by attacking their vehicle and for taking part in an illegal protest in the Shiite village of Bilad al-Qadeem, just outside the capital, Manama. </p><p> Last week, 26 Bahrainis were sentenced to 10 years in jail each after being convicted of attacking a police station with petrol bombs and iron rods in Sitra in Bahrain's northeast in April 2012. A policeman was allegedly wounded in the incident. </p><p> Following sentencing on Sunday, Bahrain's main opposition group, al-Wefaq, said on its website that detainees were regularly subjected to torture and forced to make confessions and that the courts were ignoring human rights violations committed by the security forces, Reuters reports. </p><p> The Bahrain government says it has attempted to curb violence committed by security forces by dismissing officers who cross the line, and installing security cameras at police stations to monitor potential abuses. Activists say the measures have not helped. </p><p> Bahrain has been beset by massive street demonstrations since 2011. The opposition has demanded the establishment of a constitutional government in the Shia-majority state, which is ruled by a Sunni monarchy. On the eve of the three-year anniversary of the Arab Spring-inspired protests this past February, Lese-majeste became a crime punishable by up to 7 years in prison. </p><p> The US has been reluctant to criticize the small island country, which hosts its strategically vital Fifth Fleet. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155200-mi5-hiring-russian-experts/</guid><title><![CDATA[MI5 hiring: British Secret Service looking for intel experts on Russia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155200-mi5-hiring-russian-experts/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e4/00/00/rtrdluo.jpg" title="The MI5 headquarters in central London (Reuters / David Bebber)"/><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e4/00/00/rtrdluo.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK’s MI5 has decided to beef up its team with more experts on Russia amid the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine.

We are doing this because we have a longstanding alliance partner [the Philippines]. They are interested in stepping up our military-to-military,”</em> Evan Medeiros, Obama’s top advisor on Asia, was cited as saying by AFP. <br><br> Filipino negotiators previously said that the deal wouldn’t allow the US to establish military bases in the country, or position nuclear weapons there. <br><br> But Medeiros still called the document <em>“the most significant agreement that we [the US] have concluded with the Philippines in decades.”</em> <br><br> The treaty runs for 10 years, which is shorter than Washington was originally asking for, but it can be prolonged if both sides see it necessary, two senior US officials told Reuters. <br><br> Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and US ambassador Philip Goldberg will put their signatures under the deal on April 28, just a few hours before President Barack Obama arrives to the Philippine capital, Manila, as part of his week-long Asian tour. <br><br> The United States is expected to gradually deploy combat ships, a squadron of F18s or F16s and maritime surveillance aircraft to the Philippines under the deal, a military source told Reuters. <br><br><em>“We are considering bases in Northern Luzon like Clark and Subic, and Fort Magsaysay, to accommodate the US forces. We will set aside space in those bases for their troops,"</em> the source said. <br><br> Clark and Subic were the two military bases maintained by the US military northwest of Manila until 1992, when the Philippines Senate voted to evict American troops from the country. <br><br> However, eight years later, the Senate approved an agreement allowing for temporary visits by US forces and joint military drills between the armies of the two states. <br><br> A total of 149 US Navy vessels visited the Philippines last year – almost a two-fold increase in comparison with 68 ships in 2012. <br> Manila has been seeking greater military and diplomatic support from the US in recent years, due to a territorial dispute with China. <br><br> Beijing, which claims most of the resources-rich South China Sea, has seized control of Scarborough Shoal in 2012 despite the island being situated far closer to the Filipino landmass than the Chinese. <br><br> The Chinese refused to participate in the UN tribunal on the validity of its territorial claims, which the Philippines imitated, saying that the move “seriously damaged” bilateral relations. <br><br> In March, Chinese vessels tried to block ships, which were bringing supplies to a Philippine military outpost on a tiny reef also claimed by Beijing. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155188-abbas-holocaust-heinous-crime/</guid><title><![CDATA[Palestinian president calls Holocaust 'most heinous crime' in modern history]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155188-abbas-holocaust-heinous-crime/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e3/40/00/000_nic6320965.jpg" title="Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

(AFP Photo / Abbas Momani)" /> <p> The message, delivered in Arabic and English, was timed to coincide with Israel's annual remembrance day for the mass murder of 6 million Jews during World War II. </p><p> The Holocaust, he said, represents the <em>"concept of ethnic discrimination and racism which the Palestinians strongly reject and act against."</em> </p><p> Abbas further called on the international community to stamp out racism and inequality <em>"to bring justice and equity to the oppressed people wherever they are."</em> </p><p> <em>"The Palestinian people are suffering from injustice, oppression and denied freedom and peace. We are the first to demand to lift the injustice and racism that befell on people subjected to such crimes,"</em> Abbas said. </p><p> Abbas also implored Israel to pursue a peace deal and allow Palestinians to have an independent state, just days after faltering peace talks collapsed. </p><p> The Palestinian leader had promised to issue such a statement at a meeting last week in Ramallah with Michael Schneier, former vice-president of the World Jewish Congress and head of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, Haaretz reports. </p><p> <em>"I heard what was said about Abbas' attitude toward the Holocaust, but was surprised to hear how clear he was on this issue when meeting me,"</em> Schneier told the daily. </p><h2> ‘It’s either us or them’ </h2><p> Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Abbas of forming an alliance with a <em>“Holocaust-denying terrorist organization that wants to kill more Jews.”</em> </p><p> <em>"Hamas denies the Holocaust while trying to create another Holocaust by destroying Israel,"</em> Netanyahu said in public remarks at the weekly meeting of his cabinet, the Jerusalem Post reports. <em>"It is with this Hamas that Abu Mazen chose to create an alliance last week…I hope he will escape this covenant and return to the path of real peace."</em> </p><p> A spokesman told Reuters Netanyahu's comments were not a direct response to Abbas's statement, but the Israeli leader was aware of what the Palestinian president had said. </p><p> On Wednesday, Hamas and Fatah leaders signed a reconciliation agreement following seven years of division. Under the deal, Abbas will form an interim unity government within five weeks, followed by elections in six months. The future of Hamas's security forces, which were formed in 2007 after the Islamist group first won elections in the Gaza Strip, then forced out Fatah’s security forces, remains unclear. </p><p> Prior to the reconciliation, Netanyahu had said Abbas would have to choose between peace with Israel and peace with Hamas. </p><p> <em>"You can have one but not the other. I hope he chooses peace; so far he hasn't done so,"</em> he said. </p><p> Several senior Israeli officials, including Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Strategic and Intelligence Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, have recently accused Abbas of being anti-Semitic and a Holocaust denier over his book, <em>“The Other Side: the Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism.”</em> </p><p> The book, based on Abbas' 1980s doctoral thesis from the University of Moscow, questioned the number of Jewish Holocaust victims and claimed cooperation between parts of the Zionist movement and Nazi Germany prior to the Holocaust. Abbas has since retracted those claims. </p><p> Many Arab leaders have refrained from making sweeping statements condemning the Holocaust even after striking peace accords with the Jewish state. </p><p> In September, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani acknowledged the Holocaust after years of denials by his predecessor, who had referred to it as a <em>“taboo item”</em> and a <em>"fairy tale."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155180-india-long-range-interceptor/</guid><title><![CDATA[India successfully test-fires long-range interceptor missile]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155180-india-long-range-interceptor/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e2/c0/00/rtx4gsu.jpg" title="FILE photo.

An advanced air defence interceptor missile is launched from Wheeler Island off the Dhamra coast in the eastern Indian state of Orissa. (Reuters / Indian Military)" /> <p> India’s Advanced Air Defence (AAD) interceptor missile on Sunday successfully intercepted an incoming surface-to-surface ballistic missile fired from a ship off the coast in the Bay of Bengal. <br><br><em>"The test was successful,"</em> test range director M.V.K.V. Prasad told IANS. <em>"It is the first time that we have successfully conducted the test of an exo-atmospheric interceptor,"</em> he said. <br><br> The test is part of double-tiered missile defense system that India’s military hopes will provide a multi-layered defense system against any potential ballistic missile strike. </p><p> <em>“It is a system to intercept enemy missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers,”</em> Avinash Chander, the director-general of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), said last week. <em>“The missiles will get intercepted at range of more than 100 kilometers away, so that damage to our cities can be prevented.”</em> </p><p> DRDO has already successfully tested six interceptor missiles, both in endo-atmosphere (within 30 km altitude above sea level) and exo-atmosphere stage (above 30 km altitude). <br><br> The Prithvi Air Defense interceptor missile has already demonstrated its killing capability at an altitude of 50 km and 80 km, while the AAD interceptor has successfully neutralized targets at an altitude of 15 km to 30 km. <br><br> The next step for Indian military technicians is to be able to destroy targets at an altitude of above 100 km, defense sources told Reuters. </p><p> The test moves India closer to membership in a small group of countries – the United States, Russia and Israel – which possess anti-ballistic missile technologies. <br><br> At the same time, the test will arouse suspicion among regional powers China and Pakistan, neighboring nuclear powers that in the past have experienced military confrontations with India. <br><br> At least part of the region’s militarization is related to aggressive moves on the part of the United States, which has moved the bulk of its naval forces into the Pacific region. This decision has triggered something of a domino effect, as heightened Chinese apprehension has prompted Beijing to beef up its capabilities, thus putting pressure on India and Pakistan. <br><br> Indeed, due to the geopolitical shakeup, there has been political pressure for India to rethink its nuclear doctrine that states New Delhi would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in any future theoretical confrontation. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155140-afghanistan-foreign-detention-facilities/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Several 'illegal foreign detention facilities' uncovered in Afghan govt probe]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155140-afghanistan-foreign-detention-facilities/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e0/40/00/000_dv1390902.jpg" title="This picture taken on December 11, 2012 shows a general view of some accommodation at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan's Helmand Province (AFP Photo / John Stillwell)"/><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 13:02:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/e0/40/00/000_dv1390902.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Several "unlawful" prisons run by coalition forces in Afghanistan have been uncovered at Camp Bastion and Kandahar airfield in an investigation commissioned by President Hamid Karzai.

In the course of the investigation the team surveyed number of prisoners and the conditions they were kept in. </p><p> Further details and evidence will be released after a full report is made to President Karzai. The issue at Camp Bastion, otherwise known as <a href="http://rt.com/news/uk-prisoners-afghanistan-gitmo-936/" target="_blank">'British Guantanamo'</a>, had not been addressed in the past when the British stood accused of transferring prisoners to facilities where they knew torture was taking place. But it was not made clear in Dadras’s report whether these are the same facilities as the ones he described. </p><p> Similarly, according to the NY Times, the Kandahar case raises questions, as it’s not clear whether Dadras was referring to the regulation which prohibits the detention of an Afghani for a period longer than 96 hours, before handing them over to local forces, or if the team found evidence of a facility that is illegally holding locals. </p><p> </p><p> News of the probe has received a quick response from Washington. Lt. Col. J. Todd Breasseale, a Defense Department spokesman, told the NY Times in an e-mail that <em>“every facility that we use for detention is well known not only by the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, but also by the ICRC.”</em> (The Red Cross has a strict policy of neutrality in matters of conflict.) </p><p> ISAF, the coalition armed forces command, also released a statement Saturday to say that it was <em>“aware of [the Afghan] investigative team looking into the detention facilities in Kandahar and Helmand,”</em> adding that ISAF is <em>“cooperating fully with the investigation on this matter.”</em> </p><p> The Americans then accused Karzai of trying to slander Western tactics in Afghanistan to garner political favor. </p><p> This is the latest in a string of accusations on the issues of detention between the government of outgoing president Karzai and Washington. Earlier this year, Karzai released from the US-run Bagram prison a number of Afghans captured by coalition forces for allegedly killing American troops – another move that stunned the West, who’ve been seeing Karzai’s moves as standoffish, while the leader increasingly accused the United States and Great Britain of gross human rights violations in their treatment of locals. </p><p> The souring relations that, according to the US, complicate cooperation on fighting terrorism have among other things been marked by the Afghan leader’s refusal to sign a bilateral security agreement with Washington regarding the scale of the American operation in Afghanistan after the upcoming military withdrawal in late 2014. </p><p> Although Karzai has been seen by coalition forces to be difficult to deal with, these latest allegations of potential secret torture sites are nothing new in the Western Middle East campaign. Similar revelations were made in 2011 about the Bagram Air Base, where US elite special operations had reportedly held detainees for weeks, US officials revealed to the AP. </p><p> </p><p> Up until that point, Washington denied the existence of any such facilities in Afghanistan, despite evidence and testimony by former detainees and rights groups pointing to the contrary. The Pentagon then said that those were simply temporary holding cells where prisoners were not kept longer than 14 days, but the US officials the AP had spoken to said that this could go up to nine weeks. </p><p> The Joint Special Operations Command at Bagram Air Base was said to run a total of 20 such rendition sites. This is despite President Barack Obama’s criticism of the Bush administration’s handling of the region and its methods for extracting information. </p><p> Also in 2011, it was also <a href="http://rt.com/news/uk-torture-inquiry/" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the British were prepared to use any means necessary for extracting information out of Afghan prisoners, but that inquiry faced big problems before even taking off, and there were complaints from rights groups that the results were heavily doctored. </p><p> After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the CIA’s worldwide network of facilities for the enhanced rendition of Iraq and Afghani terror suspects caused much division even within the agency itself. </p><p> An early April report also reveals cases where CIA officials <a href="http://rt.com/usa/cia-interrogation-senate-legal-040/" target="_blank">requested</a> that torture methods continue, despite analysts’ view that prisoners had no information to offer. This was all in line with the US push to extract information by any means necessary. And the report also found that a number of CIA officials lied to the government about how they attained some of the information, as well as altering a lot of the details to make a solid case for continuing. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155168-us-eu-sanctions-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[US failing to push economic sanctions against Russia through EU allies]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155168-us-eu-sanctions-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/e2/00/00/rtr3mrnr.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during joint news conference at the Perdana Putra Building in Putrajaya, April 27, 2014.

(Reuters / Larry Downing)" /> <p> G7 members agreed Friday to roll out a third round of anti-Russian sanctions over the Ukrainian crisis. But those would be an extension of the previous two rounds of sanctions, which targeted 33 individuals in Russia and Ukraine and a Russian bank, which the Western government deemed responsible for the crisis in Ukraine or close enough to President Vladimir Putin to have leverage on him. </p><p> <em>"What we will hear about in the coming days, what we will agree ... is an expansion of existing sanctions, measures against individuals or entities in Russia,"</em> UK Foreign Secretary William Hague told Sky News on Sunday. </p><p> The new round will slap travel bans and asset freezes on 15 more people, according to numerous insider reports. But it’s unlikely that they would have any greater effect on Russian policies than the sanctions already in effect. If anything, so far sanctions against the officials have only resulted in mocking calls from Russian MPs, politicians and ordinary citizens to add their names on the blacklists. </p><p> Imposing sanctions on some sectors of the Russian economy, which could actually hurt the country, remains an elusive goal for Washington. At the same time America, whose economic ties with Russia are mediocre at best compared to Europe’s, is unwilling to act alone. Otherwise, it would appear that there is conflict between Russia and the US, not Russia and the world, a narrative that Washington is struggling to promote. </p><p> <em>"We're going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified and the United States and Europe is unified rather than this is just a US-Russian conflict,"</em> US President Barack Obama told reporters on Sunday. </p><p> But Europe has much to lose from imposing economic sanctions on Russia, and Obama said he sees how US-only sanctions won’t work. </p><p> <em>“If we, for example, say that we are not going to allow certain arms sales to Russia, but every European defense contractor backfills what we do, then it’s not very effective,”</em> he said. </p><p> </p><p> With Russia being a major supplier of raw materials and buyer of European goods, the EU governments are far from being eager to shoot themselves in the foot with economic sanctions. </p><p> <em>“At the moment there is no consensus among the EU members on which economic measures against Russia would be acceptable, or even if they are needed at all,</em>” a European diplomatic source told Itar-Tass. </p><p> The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said only an open military invasion of Ukraine or irrefutable proof of Russian clandestine military presence in Ukraine would tip EU’s stance toward economic sanctions. So far every piece of evidence that Kiev and Washington made public of alleged involvement of Russian agents in Ukraine was either inconclusive or simply false. </p><p> The US and the EU are accusing Russia of stirring up anti-government protest in eastern Ukraine and failing to fulfill its obligations under last week’s Geneva statement. They want Moscow to publicly denounce the protesters holding governmental buildings in Ukraine in defiance of a military crackdown launched by Kiev. </p><p> Russia insists that it is the post-coup Ukrainian government, which is not making necessary steps to deescalate the violence. Moscow says Kiev must disarm radical nationalist groups, particularly the Right Sector, which toppled the previous Ukrainian government, and start negotiations with the protesters instead of threatening them with tanks and multiple rocket launchers. </p><p> If Kiev choses to escalate the crackdown on the protesters by using heavy arms against them Russia says it reserves the right to use its own military to stop bloodshed. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
