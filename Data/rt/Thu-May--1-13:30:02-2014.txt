The UN body warned that if the plan is not revised, the Reef's World Heritage status could be downgraded.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1c/40/00/unesco-barrier-reef-dumping-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Australia's Great Barrier Reef (AFP Photo)" /> <p> The <a href="http://rt.com/news/barrier-reef-coal-mud-448/" target="_blank">decision</a> to allow three million cubic meters of dredge waste to be disposed of in the Barrier Reef was made in January by an Australian government agency overseeing the area. The waste comes from the earlier approved expansion of the country’s port of Abbot Point – to make way for extensive coal shipments. <br><br> In its first comment on the issue, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) expressed “<em>concern</em>” and “<em>regret</em>” at the decision, which it believes was premature. It was taken before a thorough analysis of the impact it might have on the World Heritage site. <br><br> “<em>Indeed, this was approved, despite an indication that less impacting disposal alternatives may exist,</em>’’ UNESCO said on Thursday in a draft report on the reef's World Heritage status to the World Heritage Committee. <br><br> The body has urged the government to reconsider the dumping plan and in case it proves to be the least damaging option, submit evidence proving the point. <br><br> UNESCO has on the whole noted “<em>serious decline in the condition of the Great Barrier Reef, including in coral recruitment and reef-building across extensive parts of the property</em>." <br><br> It expects Australia to come up with a new report on its efforts for preserving the Great Barrier Reef by February 1, 2015. If that one fails to convince the UN body that the country is doing enough in challenging the World Heritage site’s deterioration, the Great Barrier Reef could be placed on an “<em>in Danger</em>” list, the draft report warns. <br><br></p><p> </p><p> The UN body’s criticism of the dredge waste dumping plan has been welcome by environmentalists. <br><br> "<em>UNESCO'S concern is shared by thousands of Australians and hundreds of leading scientists, and we call on the federal government to ban dumping of dredge in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area prior to the World Heritage Committee meeting in June</em>," WWF Australia spokesman, Richard Leck, said in a statement. <br><br> Government officials, both federal and those in Queensland (where the controversial port expansion is to take place) have produced optimistic comments on the UNESCO report, saying that they will not allow the downgrading of the Reef. <br><br> "<em>I'm very confident that between the work we're doing as a state and the work we're doing with our federal counterparts, we will not see the Reef listed 'in danger'</em>," Queensland's Environment Minister Andrew Powell said, as cited by ABC. <br><br> Once implemented, the project for the creation of a multi-billion-dollar coal port near the Great Barrier Reef would allow for yearly exports of 120 million tons of coal. <br><br> This has also been a matter of concern for environmentalists, who have criticized the project for doubling shipping traffic in the area. <br><br> UNESCO declared the Great Barrier Reef a World Heritage site in 1981. The area, covering some 350,000 square kilometers, is nearly the size of the US state of Montana. It is home to over 2,000 fish species, with new ones being discovered each year. There are also around 4,000 species of coral in the area. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155920-radical-islam/</guid><title><![CDATA[The gravest threat to stability in the Middle East?

It is growing. It is spreading across the world. It is destabilising communities and even nations. It is undermining the possibility of peaceful co-existence in an era of globalisation. And in the face of this threat we seem curiously reluctant to acknowledge it and powerless to counter it effectively."</em> </p><p> In the very same speech, however, Blair reveals that cognitive dissonance is a psychological condition common to Western ideologues such as himself. He said: <em>“We call for the regime to change in Syria, we encourage the opposition to rise up, but then when Iran activates Hezbollah on the side of Assad, we refrain even from air intervention to give the opposition a chance.”</em> </p><p> The opposition Blair refers to in Syria is primarily made up of the very radical Islamists he describes as the greatest threat to the Middle East and, by extension, the world. He can’t have it both ways. He can’t be against radical Islam on the one hand, yet call for those governments and peoples that are engaged in a life and death struggle against radical Islam to be defeated on the other. </p><p> But Tony Blair also has to answer for his own role in radicalising Muslims. Not only did the wars he advocated and participated in as UK Prime Minister result in chaos and carnage on a biblical scale in the Arab and Muslim worlds, they have led directly to the proliferation of the regressive ideology he now sees fit to rail against. The war in Iraq left the country devastated and has led inexorably to a society polarised along sectarian lines, with extreme violence a daily occurrence over a decade on. Blair’s role in the continuing controversy over the legality of the war has seen his political credibility torn to shreds, with repeated calls for him to face war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court in The Hague following him wherever he goes. </p><p> Yet rather than demonstrate any regret over his role in the disaster of Iraq, it has reached the stage where no drumbeat to war would be complete without the former prime minister banging the loudest. This was confirmed by his response to the vote taken by Parliament in the UK to exclude Britain from any military action against Syria in 2013. Like that embarrassing uncle who ruins every family social gathering with his propensity for saying and doing the most outrageous things, offending everyone in the process, up popped the former prime minister in an interview with the BBC lamenting Britain's historic break from Washington's coattails on the matter of military intervention for the first time in a generation. </p><p> For a man who has made a career, both in and out of British politics, as a proponent of might is right, this was tantamount to sacrilege. And for someone imbued with the belief that Britain's influence in the world is in direct proportion to its willingness to hurl cruise missiles at wherever Washington wants them hurled, it marked nothing less than the nation's ruin. </p><p> </p><p> At least Blair admitted in the BBC interview that the decision taken by the UK Parliament – an institution he treated with such naked contempt whilst Prime Minister - on Syria was heavily influenced by Iraq, the foreign policy disaster which he co-authored and pushed through with George W Bush. </p><p> You might think that even the hint of a lesson from this disaster may have been learned. But, no, the former prime minister’s only regret was over how it had made Britain <em>"hesitant"</em> to repeat it with regard to Syria. </p><p> This to be sure reveals the skewed outlook of a man so occluded from reality in the rarefied world of private jets, corporate boardrooms, and luxury homes and hotel suites he now inhabits, he no longer knows his political arse from his elbow. Not that he ever did, of course, but when prime minister he at least tried to give the impression that his feet were situated somewhere in the vicinity of Planet Earth. </p><p> For let us be under no illusion what the proposed military intervention in Syria would have involved. It would have involved the West entering into a de facto military alliance with – wait for it – radical Islam, given that various radical Islamist armed groups were by then dominating the opposition forces fighting in Syria. </p><p> Moreover, the justification for this proposed military action against the Syrian government at the time - i.e. humanitarian intervention bypassing the UN - would have constituted a breach of international law. No provision exists within the Fourth Geneva Convention<a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5"></a> for one state or any constellation of states to take aggressive military action on this basis. <em>‘Humanitarian Intervention’</em>, it should be noted, is a concept out of the Tony Blair handbook. It was first rolled out to justify NATO’s 1999 air war against the Serbian people in the former Yugoslavia. </p><p> In truth the gravest threat to stability in the Middle East and the world in general is not radical Islam but the Tony Blairs of this world: men who practice statecraft like gangsters, dividing up and policing their territories, smashing every obstacle in their way, interested only in power, wealth, and status. The legacy of Tony Blair is written in the blood of the untold thousands of men, women, and children slaughtered as a direct result of his messianic thirst for Western domination and hegemony. </p><p> Rather than giving speeches to handpicked audiences of the rich, justice demands that Tony Blair be forced to account for his crimes in the dock at the International Criminal Court. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156088-nsa-spies-americans-russians/</guid><title><![CDATA[NSA spies on more US citizens than Russians – Snowden]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156088-nsa-spies-americans-russians/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1b/80/00/nsa-spies-americans-russians.jpg" title="US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden (AFP Photo / Wikileaks)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 09:20:21 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1b/80/00/nsa-spies-americans-russians.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​The NSA gathers more data on American citizens than it does about foreigners, Edward Snowden has said.

He was greeted by a standing ovation from the audience when he received the Ridenhour Award for <em>“Truth-Telling."</em> </p><p> <br> During his speech, the whistleblower said he leaked thousands of classified government documents, detailing the NSA’s mass surveillance programs because <em>“it was the right thing to do, and now I see I’m not the only one who felt that way.”</em> <br><em><br> “I thought the most likely outcome would be spending the rest of my life in prison,”</em> said Snowden. <br><br> He also criticized the Senate and the House Intelligence committees for their lack of oversight on the NSA and the intelligence community. Leveling criticism at the NSA’s director, James Clapper, Snowden blasted him for his <em>“famous lie”</em> during a speech last year. <br><br> In a testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee last March, Clapper stated that the NSA did <em>“not wittingly gather any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.”</em> It was later revealed in Snowden’s documents that the agency does collect metadata indiscriminately from American telephone and internet companies. This prompted Clapper to go back on his statement, admitting it was <em>“erroneous”</em> in an apology letter to Congress. </p><p> <em>“When Clapper raised his hand and lied to the American public, was anyone tried? Were any charges brought?”</em> Snowden asked. <em>“Within 24 hours of going public, I had three charges against me.”</em> <br><br> The 30–year-old former CIA contractor-turned whistleblower is currently residing in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum last year after he fled the US. In response to the massive security leaks, Washington filed for Snowden’s extradition and charged him with theft, <em>“unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person”</em> under the Espionage Act. <br><br> Snowden’s visa will expire this June, but the whistleblower’s lawyer, Jesselyn Radack, says they are confident his visa will be extended for another year. <br><br><em>“Obviously, he misses America and would like to be able to come home,”</em> his attorney, Jesselyn Radack, told Reuters. <em>“We just don’t see that happening in the near future.”</em> <br><br> Radack added that Snowden was open for negotiation with the US Justice Department, but he will not be returning home <em>“to be prosecuted for espionage.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156124-turkey-protests-gas-cannon/</guid><title><![CDATA[Turkish police clash with May Day protesters in Istanbul]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156124-turkey-protests-gas-cannon/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1d/c0/00/turkey-protests-gas-cannon.jpg" title="A protester uses a slingshot while others take cover during a May Day demonstration in Istanbul May 1, 2014 (Reuters / Umit Bektas)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 09:06:37 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1d/c0/00/turkey-protests-gas-cannon.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A massive police operation has cracked down on May Day protests in the Turkish city of Istanbul.

Some activists threw Molotov cocktails and fireworks at police officers, who retaliated with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. </p><p> <em>“I have already seen a few people injured,”</em> said RT correspondent Sara Firth, who was caught in tear gas and water cannon fire whilst trying to film on the streets of Istanbul. <em>“It shows no signs of letting up at the moment.”</em> </p><p> <a class="video-link-autoprocess" href="/files/news/26/1d/c0/00/sara_web_480p.mp4">Video: /files/news/26/1d/c0/00/sara_web_480p.mp4</a> </p><p> The tear-gassing was so intense in the Besiktas district that some families were forced to evacuate their homes, reported Turkish news agency Hurriyet. At least 138 people have been detained by police and 51 people have been injured during the protests, according to information from the Progressive Lawyers Association. </p><p> </p><p> Istanbul’s authorities have taken special measures to ensure protesters do not gain access to Taksim Square, which has become a symbol for the city’s anti-government protest movement. Local press reports that at least 30 special operations units have been deployed around Gezi Park - adjacent to Taksim Square – as well as armored vehicles. </p><p> In addition, the Turkish police have also deployed specially designed, portable, steel walls for the first time. The barriers are equipped with cameras and spray tear gas automatically when they are pushed against. </p><p> Elsewhere, in the Turkish capital of Ankara, police dispersed dozens of protesters with tear gas and water cannon. </p><p> Istanbul Governor’s Office warned that Taksim Square would be off limits to the public on Wednesday, citing intelligence reports that <em>“illegal terrorist groups”</em> had plans to attack security forces. Local media also reported that almost 40,000 police had been deployed throughout the city to prevent May Day Protests. </p><p> </p><p> Prime Minister Taiyyip Erdogan, who has been the target of many anti-government protests, told citizens they should <em>“give up hope”</em> of gaining access to Taksim Square on May 1. However, Turkey’s main trade unions issued a statement on Wednesday calling the ban <em>“irrational”</em> and <em>“illegal”</em> and pledged to hold demonstrations on the square. <br><br><em>“All roads will lead to Taksim on May Day, and our struggle for labor, equality, freedom, justice and peace will continue,"</em> the main unions said in a joint statement on Wednesday. </p><p> Many of the demonstrators took to the streets to commemorate protesters who died in last year’s unrest. </p><p> Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has condemned the protest movement, dismissing demonstrators as <em>“terrorists”</em> and <em>“riff raff.”</em> The Turkish leader has come under fire for what his opposition regard as heavy-handed measures prior to his reelection this March. <br></p><p> </p><p> Following the dissemination of leaked conversations between government officials in social media, Erdogan ordered Twitter and YouTube to be blocked on March 21. <br><br> In the leaks, government officials discuss a possible plan for military intervention in Syria. <br><br> The Turkish government was obliged to lift a ban on Twitter on March 26 following a Constitutional Court ruling that called the site blockade unconstitutional. YouTube, however, remains blocked in the country. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156128-afghanistan-drugs-usa-heroin/</guid><title><![CDATA[Heroin production hits record levels in Afghanistan - study]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156128-afghanistan-drugs-usa-heroin/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1e/00/00/afghanistan-drugs-usa-heroin.jpg" title="An Afghan policeman destroys poppies during a campaign against narcotics in Kunar province, April 29, 2014 (Reuters / Parwiz)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 09:04:23 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1e/00/00/afghanistan-drugs-usa-heroin.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />America’s war on drugs is failing in Afghanistan, with opium production at record levels, despite spending $7.5 billion to tackle the problem. Over 200 thousand hectares is used to grow opium, an increase of 36 percent, according to a US report.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1e/00/00/afghanistan-drugs-usa-heroin.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="An Afghan policeman destroys poppies during a campaign against narcotics in Kunar province, April 29, 2014 (Reuters / Parwiz)" /> <p> The report, which was commissioned by <a href="http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/quarterlyreports/2014-04-30qr.pdf" target="_blank">SIGAR</a>, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction makes grim reading, with opium poppy cultivation increasing by over a third, while the country now has about 1.3 million heroin users. This is a ten-fold increase compared to 2005, when around 130,000 people were using the drug. </p><p> Afghanistan is responsible for about three-quarters of the world’s heroin production, with much of it being cultivated in the Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the south of the country. However, the US has concentrated most of its efforts in the east of Afghanistan, which has relatively little poppy production, as it is safer than working in the south. </p><p> Attempts to limit production and seize heroin have not been helped due to a downscaling of operations by the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force). In 2013, coalition forces managed to seize 41,000 kilograms of opium out of the 5.5 million kilograms produced in Afghanistan. </p><p> <em>“Drug labs, storage sites, and major trafficking networks are concentrated in rural areas that are increasingly off-limits to Afghan forces due the ISAF drawdown and declining security in these areas,”</em> the report found. </p><p> Since NATO began its ‘War on Terror’ in 2001, heroin production in Afghanistan has increased <a href="http://rt.com/news/afghanistan-election-drugs-production-753/" target="_blank">40-fold</a>, according to the head of Russia’s Federal Drug Control Service. <em>“Afghan heroin has killed more than 1 million people worldwide since ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ began, and over $1 trillion has been invested in transnational organized crime from drug sales,”</em> <a href="http://rt.com/news/nato-afghanistan-anti-narcotics-085/" target="_blank">Viktor Ivanov</a> said earlier at a conference on the Afghan drug problem in 2013. </p><p> Moscow has repeatedly pushed for the eradication of poppy fields in Afghanistan as the simplest solution. NATO, however, seems to have no intention of doing so. </p><p> In 2013, the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics reported that just 7,300 hectares of poppy fields had been destroyed, which was only three percent of the total opium fields in the country. The US has spent $7.5 billion since 2002 trying to combat the problem of opium production. However, despite these vast sums very little impact has been made on the amount of heroin appearing on the world market. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156132-florida-prison-gas-explosion/</guid><title><![CDATA[2 dead, 100-150 injured in explosion at Florida prison - police]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156132-florida-prison-gas-explosion/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1e/40/00/florida-prison-gas-explosion-1.jpg" title="Escambia County Jail facility (Image from google.maps.com)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 08:50:07 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1e/40/00/florida-prison-gas-explosion-1.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />At least 2 people have been killed and 100 injured in a gas explosion at a jail in Pensacola, Florida, according to a spokeswoman.

They also reported that while the noxious mist was distributed over such a wide area by 30 mph winds, no wildlife was impacted. </p><p> BP spokeswoman Dawn Patience said the company is “<em>still assessing repairs”</em> and will soon know what, if any, long-term effects the spill could have. </p><p> The Prudhoe Bay region, like elsewhere in the North Slope, is home to a great number of migratory birds and caribou, as well as other animals, such as a massive porcupine herd. Clean-up efforts are expected to be complete before birds pass through the region again in the coming weeks. </p><p> The company was at fault in at least two oil spills in the same region since 2006. That year, an estimated 267,000 gallons of oil seeped through a quarter-inch sized hole in a corroded BP pipeline. That accident went unnoticed for five days, until an oil worker smelled the aroma of crude when driving through the area, according to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/04/30/3432602/bp-oil-spray/" target="_blank">Think Progress</a>. </p><p> The company spent $500 million on upgrading 16 miles of pipeline that transported oil into a processing facility dubbed Gathering Center 2. </p><p> Instead of acting as a warning to the company, though, the 2006 spill only served as a preview for a 2009 spill that sent approximately 14,000 gallons from a pipeline into the tundra and wetlands of Prudhoe Bay. </p><p> “<em>The 2009 spill vividly demonstrates that BP has not adequately addressed the management and environmental compliance problems that have plagued it for many years</em>,” US government lawyers said in a court filing that sought to levy steep fines onto BP, as quoted by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-29/bp-pipeline-rupture-may-force-company-to-pay-more-for-2006-spill.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>. </p><p> “<em>This rupture was the result of a predictable and preventable freezing of produced water within the pipeline that caused the pipe to over-pressurize and burst. Eerily similar to the 2006 spill, BP ignored alarms that warned of the pipe’s eventual rupture and leak</em>.” </p><p> Officials made the most recent finding less than a week after a report from the US National Research Council (NRC) announced that regulators are not prepared to effectively respond to an Arctic oil spill. The 198-page assessment authored by scientists at the request of the American Petroleum Institute and the Coast Guard found that while more research still needs to be done, the current situation is bleak. </p><p> “<em>The lack of infrastructure in the Arctic would be a significant liability in the event of a large oil spill,</em>” the report stated, as quoted by the <a href="http://fuelfix.com/blog/2014/04/23/report-us-ill-prepared-to-tackle-arctic-oil-spills/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>. “<em>It is unlikely that responders could quickly react to an oil spill unless there were improved port and air access, stronger supply chains and increased capacity to handle equipment, supplies and personnel</em>.” </p><p> Most of the information regulators have gathered on how to respond to oil spills comes from warmer areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico – the site of another massive BP oil spill in April 2010. Yet the drilling areas far to the north remain largely isolated from the resources in the Gulf, with the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest deep water port. </p><p> As such, the NRC recommended the US quickly institute “<em>a comprehensive, collaborative, long-term Arctic oil spill research and development program</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/156080-ukraine-gas-debt-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia reaches $3.5 bn]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/156080-ukraine-gas-debt-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1b/00/00/ukraine-gas-debt-russia.jpg" title="Reuters / Stringer"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 03:12:07 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1b/00/00/ukraine-gas-debt-russia.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia has hit $3.5 billion, according to preliminary data released on Wednesday, a Gazprom official told reporters.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1b/00/00/ukraine-gas-debt-russia.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Stringer" /> <p> The new data includes Ukraine’s Naftogaz order as of April 30 and those volumes that were already supplied this month, Sergey Kupriyanov stated. </p><p> Ukraine's energy minister, Yury Prodan, responded, stating that Ukraine does now agree with Russia’s gas debt estimate of US$3.5 billion, UNN news agency reported. Prodan added that Ukraine continues to insist on the price of $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters for Russian gas. </p><p> Last week, Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said that Ukraine’s growing gas debt may lead to the failure of the country’s <a href="http://rt.com/business/155100-ukraine-gas-debt-eu/" target="_blank">transit</a> obligations and the reduction of gas supplies to southeastern Europe. </p><p> The debt may force a situation where not enough gas will be pumped into Ukrainian underground storage facilities, which may create the risk of non-performance by Ukraine of its transit obligations and of an undersupply of gas to southeastern Europe, the minister stated. </p><p> In December, Russia provided Ukraine with a $3 billion loan, which was part of a larger $15 billion aid package agreed the same month. Moscow also offered a 33 percent gas price discount that would have saved more than $7.5 billion. </p><p> In April, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that Russia cannot continue to <a href="http://rt.com/business/putin-ukraine-economy-gas-353/" target="_blank">prop up</a> Ukraine’s faltering economy. </p><p> <em>“The Russian Federation doesn’t recognize the legitimacy of the authorities in Kiev, but it keeps providing economic support and subsidizing the economy of Ukraine with hundreds of millions and billions of dollars. This situation can’t last indefinitely,”</em> Putin said. </p><p> Ukraine has not paid for Russian gas since the beginning of 2013, and with all discounts withdrawn it is now charged $485 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156076-rob-ford-break-crack/</guid><title><![CDATA[Toronto Mayor Rob Ford to take leave of absence following new crack video]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156076-rob-ford-break-crack/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1a/c0/00/rob-ford-break-crack.jpg" title="Rob Ford (Reuters / Mark Blinch)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 02:07:04 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1a/c0/00/rob-ford-break-crack.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Toronto Mayor Rob Ford says he will take a leave of absence from his job and re-election campaign to address his substance abuse problem.

Once it was more widespread among the Cuban population, it would introduce political content that would attempt to inspire Cubans to <em>"renegotiate the balance of power between the state and society.”</em> </p><p> Despite the State Department’s assertions that the program was not used to influence political leanings, AP reported Wednesday that cell phone users were categorized in databases as being <em>“pro-revolution,” “apolitical,”</em> or <em>“anti-revolutionary.”</em> </p><p> One young contractor working on the project was Paula Cambronero, whose first job out of college was working on how Cubans interacted with ZunZuneo messages carefully – and quietly – sent from Spanish phone numbers. The contractor asked Cambronero to communicate with staff over encrypted channels, and emails were sent from a domain name “not publicly linked” to the contractor. </p><p> Her employer – not named by AP – told her that she would be dealing with a <em>"considerable amount of sensitive information that must be safeguarded to protect critical operations of the Project."</em> USAID even established a dummy company in the Cayman Islands to cover any money trail associated with ZunZuneo. </p><p> Cambronero’s responsibility was to build a database of unsuspecting Cuban cell phone users that responded to ZunZuneo messages, using classifications like gender, age, location, <em>“receptiveness,”</em> and <em>“political tendencies.”</em> She would analyze how users reacted to overtly political messages written by a hired Cuban satirist that poked at the nation’s leaders. </p><p> Cambronero did not respond to AP’s request for comment. The State Department had no comment to AP on Wednesday. </p><p> </p><p> On Tuesday, USAID spokesman Matthew Herrick told AP that the agency had reviewed the project and offered congressional investigators the selection of messages sent to Cubans. </p><p> Herrick claimed the 249 different messages focused on sports, technology, world news, and trivia, and that the messages <em>"were consistent with the objective of creating a platform for Cubans to speak freely among themselves."</em> </p><p> The political messages crafted by the satirist were sent <em>“under a grant that pre-dated the ZunZuneo project,”</em> Herrick said. </p><p> Yet documents reviewed by AP show that USAID considered the grant a <em>“test phase”</em> of the network that would become ZunZuneo. </p><p> Overall, Cambronero collected more than 700 responses to text messages, analyzing them by two variables: the level of interest in the received messages and the political content of a response. </p><p> She found that 68 percent of responses exhibited mild interest in the ZunZuneo texts. Many responses – 210 total – wanted to know who was sending the anonymous message. </p><p> <em>"Explain your point better because I don't understand and remember that if you haven't done anything you shouldn't fear anything, at least tell me your name if you're not a coward,"</em> said one respondent. </p><p> Others asked for help in obtaining birth certificates of Spanish ancestors, a prerequisite for acquiring a Spanish passport to leave Cuba. </p><p> Only 59 responses were analyzed for political content. Cambronero found 10 that did have <em>“political character,”</em> AP reported, <em>“of which two were counter-revolutionary.”</em> </p><p> In her notes, Cambronero recommended that <em>"messages with a humorous connotation should not contain a strong political tendency, so as not to create animosity in the recipients."</em> </p><p> Upon the ZunZuneo revelations, the Obama administration quickly came under attack and promptly denounced allegations that it covertly plotted to disrupt Cuban politics. </p><p> Condemnation of the program continues to emerge. In Costa Rica, where ZunZuneo was reportedly developed by American officials, the nation’s foreign minister Enrique Castillo <a href="http://rt.com/usa/154624-costa-rica-cuban-twitter/" target="_blank">said</a> last week that not only does he think it was <em>“inappropriate”</em> for the US to use his country to conduct the project, but that he previously warned officials not to involve his Central American country in the endeavor due to fears it would strain Costa Rica’s own relationship with Cuba. </p><p> <em>"I think it's inappropriate to use an embassy in Costa Rica for this type of operation that harms a third country,"</em> Castillo told the AP. <em>"We're not filing a complaint. The point is that embassies accredited in Costa Rica don't have to submit their plans or programs for the Costa Rican government's approval."</em> </p><p> Costa Rica’s minister of communications, Carlos Roverssi, said Wednesday that it will fall on the country’s recently elected government to deal with the matter from here on out. </p><p> <em>"It seems to me that the issue is now public and the next government should follow up on the issue, without a doubt,"</em> he said. </p><p> The US State Department has begun a review of the program, saying it would be <em>“troubling”</em> if ZunZuneo involved political messaging. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156060-lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut/</guid><title><![CDATA[Advocates decry transfer of transgender teen to adult male prison]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156060-lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/c0/00/lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut.jpg" title="Reuters / Dario Pignatelli"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 01:06:32 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/c0/00/lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A judge’s decision to send a troubled 16-year-old transgender teen to a Connecticut prison for adults has alarmed her lawyer and advocates who say the girl, charged with no crime, should be placed in the hands of a caring family.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/c0/00/lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Dario Pignatelli" /> <p> Identified only as Jane Doe, the youth identifies as a female. She has been under the care of the state since the age of five, when social workers removed her from her family’s home – her father was in jail and her mother was battling an addiction to crack, heroin, and alcohol. </p><p> She was brutally abused multiple times while in the care of the Department of Children and Families (DCF). In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1113035-4-14-14affidavit-redacted-reduced.html" target="_blank">court papers</a> filed this month, she claims that she was repeatedly raped while having her life threatened by being punched, kicked, and bashed in the head by family members for playing with dolls. </p><p> “<em>At about age 12 I was placed by DCF at a residential facility in Eagleton School in Massachusetts, where a worker named [redacted] used to show the other children pornographic magazines, and on two occasions I was in his office and he had me perform oral sex on him</em>,” she said, among other heinous incidents. </p><p> Authorities said the teen was removed from the care of DCF after attacking a staff member in an assault that left the employee temporarily blinded and with a broken jaw. Despite filing no charges against the girl, the state transferred her to a women’s prison in East Lyme, Connecticut, where she has been kept in her cell for 22 to 23 hours a day in a wing for mentally ill inmates. </p><p> “<em>We are sensitive to the traumatic and difficult experiences the youth has encountered over her life</em>,” said a DCF statement issued earlier this month. “The judge who issued the transfer order heard evidence over a six-day period in which there was ample evidence provided by numerous witnesses stating under oath that the youth has propensity for violence. </p><p> “<em>The youth has an extensive history of violence, including targeting female staff at several programs as well as other girls in the program</em>,” the statement went on. </p><p> Advocates disagreed with that decision, saying that if the allegations of assault are indeed correct, it’s only natural for such a troubled youth to react in unpredictable ways. </p><p> “<em>This is a youth that has not been convicted of an adult crime in an adult court that is now being placed in an adult correctional facility</em>,” Connecticut state child advocate Sarah Egan told <a href="http://wnpr.org/post/transgender-teen-sent-connecticut-adult-prison" target="_blank">WNPR</a> radio. “<em>This is a tremendously unusual and concerning action by the state against a 16-year-old</em>.” </p><p> The situation has struck some observers as curious because the DCF recently opened the Solnit Center in Middletown, Connecticut, a home for girls with serious emotional issues. The DCF commissioner told WNPR that residents there “<em>have been the victims of trauma; they have been abused; sexually abused, whatever the circumstances are, and they need that much more of an intensive-based treatment</em>.” </p><p> Earlier this month, Aaron Romano, the girl’s attorney, pressed for a court order that would have made the situation even worse. Romano told the <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-transgender-juvenile-sent-to-prison-20140409,0,6060233.story?page=1" target="_blank">Hartford Courant</a> there is a risk that the transgender teen could be transferred to the Marion Correctional Institution, a prison for males under 21 years of age. </p><p> “<em>This is really an embarrassment for DCF and the state on several levels</em>,” he said. “<em>Had DCF followed through in its child-protection mandate, this child would now be at Middletown juvenile facility</em>.” </p><p> The American Civil Liberties Union and GLAAD (formerly known as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) have spoken out against the possible transfer. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156068-revived-silk-road-bigger/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Revived’ illicit online bazaar Silk Road ‘bigger than ever’ as Feds fail to keep up]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156068-revived-silk-road-bigger/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1a/40/00/silk-road.jpg" title="Image from the Digital Citizens Alliance report"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 01:06:14 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1a/40/00/silk-road.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The notorious website Silk Road – which served as a middleman that allowed its customers to anonymously buy drugs, weapons, and criminal software – is more popular than ever, despite the arrest of its founder six months ago, says a new report.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1a/40/00/silk-road.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Image from the Digital Citizens Alliance report" /> <p> “<em>Approximately 13,648 listings for drugs are now available on Silk Road compared to the 13,000 that were listed shortly before the FBI arrested Ross William Ulbricht and shut down the site. The Darknet drug economy as a whole contains 75 percent more listings for drugs,</em>” claims a newly published <a href="https://media.gractions.com/314A5A5A9ABBBBC5E3BD824CF47C46EF4B9D3A76/5f8d4168-c36a-4f78-b048-f5d48b18dc0a.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the Digital Citizens Alliance, a public group dedicated to reducing online crime. <br><br> Though US authorities have charged Ulbricht with conspiracy to distribute narcotics, for designing and operating the website that allowed users to buy anything apart from child pornography and weapons of mass destruction, his website has been reopened with an identical interface to reassure loyal buyers. <br><br> Even Ulbricht’s alleged moniker, Dread Pirate Roberts, has been appropriated by another administrator, who users refer to as DPR2. <br><br> February’s theft of users’ virtual currency bitcoin – worth more than $2.6 million – only seems to have “<em>reassured</em>” users. The administrators of the site have promised to repay the money instead of shutting off services and disappearing as others have done on the so-called 'Darknet' – an unregulated part of the internet accessed through anonymous software. <br><br> The detentions of three more people possibly connected to the operation, and rumors of further arrests, have not dampened interests, either. <br><br> “<em>The last six months have tested the wherewithal of the Darknet Marketplaces. Arrests, site seizures, scams from small to massive, and an ever-increasing amount of paranoia have challenged those who buy and sell illicit goods online. The Marketplaces have proven resilient and as one closes or disappears, several others pop up to take its place</em>,” alleges the report. <br><br> An appendix provided with the report shows that every single one of the most popular traders on the original Silk Road site either continues to trade there, or has moved onto other services. <br><br> The report's authors say they are not only worried about drugs, but also the general platform that Silk Road provides. <br><br> “<em>While the brazen sales of heroin and crystal meth attract attention, the real money is in underground financial transactions...The true value of Silk Road in the criminal underground is more than drugs; it is the further enabling of secret illicit activity.”</em> <br><br> The Digital Citizens Alliance has chided legislators and government agencies for being unable to keep up with the criminals. <br><br> “<em>The government in general struggles with developing any internet policy, and the cryptonet debate seems even more fraught with apathy,</em>” states the report. <br><br> But few solutions seem apparent. <br><br> “<em>The policy development areas for [anonymizer software] Tor, bitcoin, and Darknet Marketplaces are wide open. US states may see the need to create their own policies or recommend federal ones. States may see the need to regulate bitcoin exchanges in their own jurisdictions or require internet service providers to block Tor use locally, regardless of how technically implausible it might be. This is a brave new world of policy analysis,</em>” the report states. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156048-gary-johnson-us-politics-today/</guid><title><![CDATA[US involvement in Ukraine is like ‘Russia getting involved in Puerto Rico’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156048-gary-johnson-us-politics-today/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/00/00/1gary-johnson-us-politics-today.jpg" title="Gary Johnson"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 00:29:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/00/00/1gary-johnson-us-politics-today.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Though Republicans hold a majority of seats in the House of Representatives and Democrats hold a majority of seats in the Senate, a majority of Americans say that neither party represents them.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/00/00/1gary-johnson-us-politics-today.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Gary Johnson" /> <p> According to a new national survey by Rasmussen, 53 percent of likely US voters think that neither political party truly represents the American people. The poll shows that the two-party system is losing ground with Americans – six months ago, in October, only 46 percent of questioned voters said that neither party represents Americans. </p><p> RT’s Lindsay France spoke with 2012 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson about Americans’ lack of representation in the halls of political power. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Now let’s talk about this lack of representation. Seventy-two percent say it would be better if the country didn’t elect the incumbents to Congress this year in November. If they don’t trust either party, the incumbents or the new guys, what’s the alternative? </p><p> <strong>Gary Johnson:</strong> Well, first of all, I agree with the poll. I think this is what we’re all witnessing. I think term limits would really be a silver bullet, the notion that people would get in, do the right thing and get out. And then, Lindsay, you know, a couple of issues of late that really left all the politicians behind: the marriage equality, nobody was standing up for that; the marijuana legalization, the state of Washington, the state of Colorado moving ahead of all politicians; and then if you look at Libya and Syria, the president’s ready to go in militarily, Congress is ready to dot the i’s and cross the t’s on how to do that and, lo and behold, 80 percent of Americans don’t want to do that. Well that’s a good thing. I just wish that Congress would catch up to the fact that this spending is not sustainable and, if they don’t fix this, we’re going to find ourselves in a monetary crisis. We’re going to find ourselves without a country. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about government trust among young voters, those between the ages of about 18 and 29. A new poll surveying young Americans’ political attitudes released by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics [on] Tuesday, found that the millennials’ 'composite trust index,' it’s called, which is the level of trust, on average, in six different public institutions: the presidency, the US military, the Supreme Court, the federal government, and the United Nations, it’s dropped dramatically in just two years...from 39 two years ago down to 31 in mid-April...How do politicians come back from this sort of a drop? We’re talking about the young generation, the young voters here. </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Lindsay, I know you have statistics there on young voters, but I believe that it isn’t just young voters. I think that they are the canary, though, in the coal mine, and that, if politicians don’t get in touch with this, that, really, we’re going to find ourselves...I do already think we’re in a catastrophe of sorts in that we’re not being represented. Of course, having run for the Libertarian nomination for president, I can tell you that whether you’re a Libertarian, whether you’re a Democrat, whether you’re a Republican, you have baggage whether you have that baggage or not. We’re suing the Presidential Debates Commission right now to say if mathematically you are a party that can conceivably be elected president of the United States with enough electoral votes, then shouldn’t you be included in the debates? Just give another voice out there, and the more voices we have with input on where this country should go, I suggest we’ll all be a lot better off. But it is a two-party system, and it’s very exclusionary. I found that out face-to-face. It’s not a good thing. More voices, the better. And I’m not being hypocritical here. As governor of New Mexico, I made it as easy as, I signed legislation making it as easy as possible for third parties to be able to run. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about these other voices. You know, even after the midterm elections, President Obama’s got a while left in the White House. He’s facing <a href="http://rt.com/usa/155720-obama-approval-lowest-of-term/" target="_blank">very low approval ratings</a> right now – extremely low, embarrassingly low. What does this midterm election look like? Can it change things? Will new voices, depending on who makes it in through the midterm elections, change his approval ratings? Will they be able to steer him away from some of those bad decisions? </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I don’t place blame on Obama, I do place blame on the system that is very status quo oriented, that more than anything politicians are concerned with getting reelected, as opposed to doing the right thing...When people don’t vote, it’s a, you know, that’s not a good thing. And maybe we’ll see some huge voter turnout. I have no optimism whatsoever that anything changes in Washington as a result of these midterm elections. Look, I think that the president should be a leader and that he should be controversial and that he should press the things that he wants to do. And Republicans, they should be leading on the issues that they should be strong on, and that would be spending and that would be the deficit. And then both parties, they ought to come together on issues that everybody cares about. I think the majority of Americans – speaking with a broad brushstroke – are fiscally responsible and socially liberal. I always tell people I’m as conservative a politician as you’ve ever met when it comes to dollars and cents, and I’m a flaming liberal when it comes to civil liberties. The militarization of our police forces, this is happening under the guise of both political parties watching this. I mean, it’s getting so bad. One-hundred-and-ten million Verizon users are being monitored by the NSA. This is happening under the eyes of both political parties. There just doesn’t seem to be any hope out there. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about our foreign involvements, which most people will say have been numerous lately. As the saying goes, “Go big or go home.” Well, we’ve gone big, and now it appears it’s time to go home. According to nearly half of the respondents from an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 47 percent of them say the US should become less active in world affairs. Now if you look at what’s going on: US involvement in Ukraine, the Iraq debacle, troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, trying to go into Syria, Libya before that, what is the way forward for those who want votes this election season, with all of the concern Americans feel on these issues? </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Well, the way politicians address this of course is to get tough, drop bombs. I mean, Republicans are all about who’s going to drop the first bomb? What about the notion of free trade? Gosh, is China really an enemy when they’re, you know, our second biggest trading partner? I don’t think so! We should be looking at trade with other countries first and foremost...You don’t go to war against trading partners. But yet we’re always talking about sanctions, and sanctions just don’t work. And when you look at Ukraine right now, I think that would be analogous to Russia getting involved in Puerto Rico. They’re not going to do it. We shouldn’t get involved in Ukraine. There are unintended consequences as a result of our military interventions. I’m going to suggest that we have hundreds of millions of enemies to this country because of our military interventions. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about Ukraine for a minute. Obviously it’s a hot spot in world topics...How should the US approach the crisis in Ukraine? Should the US do more or less? </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Well, less! Look, don’t get involved in Ukraine! It would be like Russia getting involved in the affairs of Puerto Rico. They’re not going to do it! We shouldn’t be involved in Ukraine! There’s no national security interest here at stake. And I know you’ll hear politicians beating their chests, arguing the opposite. Well, I’m going to argue that there is no national security interest here at risk, and the government has an obligation to protect us against foreign governments that might do us harm – this is not one of those situations. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156036-one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘One nation under Allah’: FL conservatives push for anti-Sharia legislation]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156036-one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/40/00/one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria.jpg" title="Rocky Mountain High School, Colorado (Image from 999thepoint.com)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 22:46:21 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/18/40/00/one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Florida conservatives, evidently alarmed by changing social and income demographics, are pushing legislation to combat what they say is the attempted indoctrination of American students with Islamic ideology.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/40/00/one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Rocky Mountain High School, Colorado (Image from 999thepoint.com)" /> <p> Lawmakers are currently considering a so-called “<em>anti-Sharia bill</em>” which passed through the state Senate with a 24-14 vote on Monday. Sharia, which varies between cultures, is the basic path which devout Muslims try to follow. The rules, while strict by Western standards, often stretch past the confines of a mosque and regulate aspects of secular law, including crime, public policy, sex, diet, and economics. </p><p> “<em>Those people who want to come to America, we welcome them, but when you come to America, you are going to be governed under American laws, when you come to Florida you are going to be governed by Florida laws, and we ought not to apologize for that</em>,” Sen. Alan Hays, a Republican, told the <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/blogs/political-pulse/sfl-state-senators-advance-controversial-antisharia-bill-20140428,0,4912559.post" target="_blank">Orlando Sentinel</a> after the bill passed through the state Senate. </p><p> While the bill will now move to the state House of Representatives for approval, members of the Senate were still wondering who, exactly, is trying to impose Islamic restrictions on the mostly Christian Florida population. According to a <a href="http://religions.pewforum.org/maps" target="_blank">recent analysis</a> from the Pew Research Center, a mere one percent of Florida's population is Muslim, compared to the 66 percent of Floridians who practice some form of Christianity. </p><p> “<em>There is no record of Sharia law being implemented in the courts of Florida or any other state</em>,” Sen. Eleanor Sobel, a Democrat who opposed the bill, told the Sentinel. </p><p> Officials were similarly confused when educators, in an apparent attempt to break down cultural barriers, came under attack from members of their community who were trying to do the opposite. </p><p> A controversy erupted in Volusia County, Florida in November when a student brought her social studies textbook home to her parents, who found that the curriculum dedicated a specific section to the history and beliefs of Islam. Experts told the Daytona News Journal that the rest of the book was full of references to Christianity and Judaism, but the first complaint blossomed into a contingency of parents who felt that their rights were somehow being infringed upon. </p><p> “<em>We hope that the School Board will respect our voices in the process of education and reject voices of intolerance and censorship</em>,” a petition calling on administrators to replace the book read. The document failed to explain how an education based on the knowledge of various religions equated to censorship. </p><p> Conservatives in Colorado were equally upset when a Muslim student led the rest of the school in the Pledge of Allegiance while replacing the traditional “<em>under God</em>” with “<em>under Allah</em>.” The pledge was adopted in US schools in 1942 at the height of World War II but was only amended to include “<em>under God</em>” a decade later, as a way for Americans to differentiate themselves from the Soviet Union’s atheism policy during the Cold War. </p><p> Colorado’s Cultural Arms Club, which advertises its mission to “<em>destroy the barriers, embrace the cultures</em>” that exist throughout the region, organized the “<em>under Allah</em>” pledge at Rocky Mountain High School. It quickly came under fire from parents who felt that it would be unpatriotic to utter the pledge in any form other than the traditional one. </p><p> “<em>These students love this country</em>,” school principal Tom Lopez told <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/school-recites-pledge-in-arabic-one-nation-under-allah.html" target="_blank">Fox News</a> at the time. “<em>They were not being un-American in trying to do this. They believed they were accentuating the meaning of the words as spoken regularly in English</em>.” </p><p> The problem, Lopez said, was not that the school was trying to be more inclusive, but that a vocal fraction of the community was so up in arms. </p><p> “<em>I’ve been shocked with prejudicial statements that have been made,”</em> he continued<em>. “I’ve been shocked with the lack of seeking understanding. There’s definitely some suspicion and fear expressed in these people’s minds. There’s some hate</em>,” he said. </p><p> Like Principal Lopez, a growing number of pundits and lawmakers have called for more information on Islamic culture and beliefs. Even now, more than a decade after religious tension heightened in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, nearly two-thirds of Americans asked about other world faiths admitted they had “<em>little or no knowledge</em>” about what Muslims believe, according to New York University professor Jonathan Zimmerman. </p><p> “<em>To live together as citizens of a nation, we need to understand each other’s fundamental assumptions and beliefs about the world</em>,” Zimmerman wrote in the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/give-kids-muslim-holidays-teach-religious-history-schools-article-1.1767687" target="_blank">New York Daily News</a>. “<em>And we can’t do that without understanding religion, which remains the basic wellspring of those beliefs for many of us</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156052-sinn-fein-adams-murder/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams detained over notorious 1972 murder]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156052-sinn-fein-adams-murder/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/40/00/sinn-fein-arrest-murder.jpg" title="Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams (Reuters / Neil Hall)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 21:46:31 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/40/00/sinn-fein-arrest-murder.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Northern Ireland police have detained and questioned Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in connection with the 1972 abduction and murder of Jean McConville by the IRA, his party said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/40/00/sinn-fein-arrest-murder.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams (Reuters / Neil Hall)" /> <p> McConville, a widowed mother of 10, was abducted from her home in west Belfast and shot by the IRA amid fierce sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. She was wrongly accused of being an informant. </p><p> Adams, 65, said in a statement that he was <em>“innocent of any part”</em> of McConville’s death, Reuters reported. Her body was recovered from a beach in County Louth in 2003. </p><p> The Police Service of Northern Ireland said in a statement that a man had “presented himself” to authorities Wednesday evening, but they did not name the suspect. </p><p> Sinn Fein said in a statement: <em>“Last month Gerry Adams said he was available to meet the PSNI about the Jean McConville case. That meeting is taking place this evening."</em> </p><p> Last month, Ivor Bell, a leader in the Provisional IRA in the 1970s, was charged with aiding and abetting McConville’s murder. Other arrests have recently been made in connection with the murder. </p><p> Bell’s case was based on an interview which he allegedly gave to researchers at Boston College in the United States. A series of candid, confessional interviews with former loyalists and republican paramilitaries was taped in an effort to provide an oral history of the Troubles. </p><p> Interviewees were told that the tapes would not be released to the public until after their deaths, but a series of court cases in the US resulted in some of the content being handed to law enforcement. </p><p> An investigation by the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman cleared McConville of accusations that she was an informant. According to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR), McConville was one of 16 people known as the <em>'Disappeared'</em> – those abducted, murdered, and buried in secret by republicans during the era of the Troubles. </p><p> The IRA admitted in 1999 that it murdered and secretly buried nine of the Disappeared. The other seven have yet to be found. The ICLVR is aimed at locating the remains of those still missing. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156056-imf-approves-ukraine-aid/</guid><title><![CDATA[IMF gives green light for $17 bn Ukraine aid package]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156056-imf-approves-ukraine-aid/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/80/00/imf-approves-ukraine-aid.jpg" title="The International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters building is seen in Washington, DC (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 21:18:47 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/80/00/imf-approves-ukraine-aid.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The International Monetary Fund has approved a two-year $17.1 billion loan package for Ukraine.

More than half of that money will be dedicated to supporting the country's budget. </p><p> The package will open up loans from other donors totaling around $15 billion. The goal is for Ukraine to use the money to stabilize its economy. </p><p> <em>"The authorities' economic program supported by the Fund aims to restore macroeconomic stability, strengthen economic governance and transparency, and launch sound and sustainable economic growth, while protecting the most vulnerable,</em>" the IMF said in a statement. </p><p> IMF managing director Christine Lagarde commented on the aid package, stating that the plan may come with geopolitical and implementation risks. </p><p> <em>"On the implementation front, we are taking all the precautions we can in order to mitigate those risks,"</em> Lagarde told reporters on Wednesday. <em>"On the geopolitical front, clearly the bilateral international support, and the cooperation of all parties, will be extremely helpful to reinforce the position of the economy of Ukraine.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> <em>"We believe that Ukraine has an opportunity to seize the moment, to break away from previous practices, both from the fiscal, from the monetary, and from the governance point of view,”</em> Lagarde added. </p><p> Ukraine’s crisis was exacerbated after months of anti-government protests and Crimea’s referendum to join Russia. </p><p> The country's economy is forecasted to contract by three percent due to the chaos and lack of order, according to Ukrainian authorities. The nation's output dropped 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014. </p><p> The ongoing protests, especially in the east of the country, are not helping the nation get its economy back on track. In fact, Ukraine’s acting President Aleksandr Turchinov said on Wednesday that Kiev’s government <a href="http://rt.com/news/155856-ukraine-alert-president-army/" target="_blank">cannot control</a> the situation in the east of the country, and called to speed up the creation of regional militias loyal to Kiev. </p><p> Lagarde noted that further sanctions against Russia may harm Ukraine's economy even further, as its neighboring country is a key export market for Ukraine. </p><p> <em>"Clearly on the front of sanctions, anything that undermines the economic situation of the country will jeopardize the implementation of the program, which is why we very strongly encourage the parties to negotiate, to come to terms,"</em> Lagarde said. </p><p> </p><h2> 'Bold program of reforms' </h2><p> Lagarde argued that Ukraine has already shown its ability to undertake <em>“comprehensive reforms,”</em> listing a few of the sacrifices that have been made. </p><p> <em>“Whether it was a question of letting the exchange rate float, whether it was a question of reforming the procurement law, whether it was a question of modifying the price of gas to customers or to corporate. They’ve (Ukrainian government) done all these things to demonstrate their determination to endorse a very bold program of reforms,”</em> Lagarde stated. </p><p> The IMF money comes with stringent terms, asking for various cuts and economic reforms. In the case of Ukraine, the requirements include a 50 percent increase in the price of gas for households, as well as a quick pension reform and lower government spending. </p><p> The World Bank <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-imf-consumption-decrease-576/" target="_blank">warned</a> on April 10 that the loan terms set by the IMF would cut 2014 consumption in Ukraine by 8 percent, as well as erode capital investment. </p><p> The increased cost of household gas and district heating <em>“will affect purchasing power and limit the government’s ability to boost capital spending this year. Thus, in 2014, we expect to see a decline in both consumption and fixed investment,”</em> the World Bank said in a statement. </p><p> </p><p> Earlier in April, Ukraine’s finance minister, Oleksandr Shlapak, said that <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-imf-debt-russia-864/">paying off</a> debt to Russia would not be a top priority for Ukraine when it secured its first tranche of International Monetary (IMF) bailout cash. </p><p> Ukraine’s total debt to Russia, including the $2.2 billion bill for gas, now stands at $16.6 billion, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. </p><p> Back in December, before the Ukrainian protests turned into a nationwide crisis, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian government would essentially <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-15-billion-gas-381/" target="_blank">buy</a> $15 billion in Ukrainian debt by investing in Ukrainian bonds, using money from Russia's National Welfare Fund. The announcement came after a meeting with then-President Viktor Yanukovich in Moscow. </p><p> The deal included a 33 percent discount for natural gas, which could have save the country $7 billion in 2014. The agreement was hailed by then-Prime Minister Azarov as saving Ukraine from economic ruin. </p><p> Protests in Kiev began in November when Ukraine backed out of a trade negotiation deal with the EU in favor of a debt deal with Russia – a move interpreted by Ukrainians as a decisive step away from integration with the EU. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156040-michael-flynn-dia-leaving/</guid><title><![CDATA[US Defense Intelligence Agency director reportedly being forced out]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156040-michael-flynn-dia-leaving/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/80/00/michael-flynn-dia-leaving.jpg" title="Defense Intelligence Agency director U.S. Army Lt.

General Michael Flynn (Reuters / Gary Cameron)" /> <p> United States DIA Director Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn announced to Pentagon staff that he is walking away from that role a year earlier than anticipated. </p><p> The news came via a joint statement made by Flynn and the agency's deputy director, David Shedd, who will also be vacating his post. </p><p> <em>"We are proud of the legacy of sustained superb performance of the thousands of men and women we have served alongside throughout these many years,"</em> they <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_DEFENSE_INTELLIGENCE?SITE=TXMID&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" target="_blank">said</a>. </p><p> According to Washington Post reporters <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/head-of-pentagon-intelligence-agency-forced-out-officials-say/2014/04/30/ec15a366-d09d-11e3-9e25-188ebe1fa93b_story.html" target="_blank">Greg Miller and Adam Goldman</a> the director’s unexpected announcement is the result of increased pressure coming from the likes of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and others who reportedly did not agree with Flynn’s managerial style. </p><p> <em>“His vision in DIA was seen as disruptive; he’s not a guy to take the agency forward in a coordinated and comprehensive manner,”</em> one former Pentagon official told the Post of Flynn, a former colleague. </p><p> Flynn, the source said, wanted to push DIA analysts and operators <em>“up and out of their cubicles into the field to support war fighters or high-intensity operations.”</em> </p><p> Critics of Flynn, the journalists wrote, considered his management style to have <em>“sowed chaos, setting aggressive plans for changes without adequate follow-through”</em> within the agency. </p><p> <em>“I’m not sure DIA sees itself as that,</em>” their source said to the paper. </p><p> According to Miller and Goldman, the decision to take Flynn out of his DIA role comes in the midst of other major changes within both the US intelligence community and military, both of which have been shaken up in recent months after former government contractor Edward Snowden began releasing a trove of sensitive material to the media. </p><p> <em>“I think if I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries,”</em> Flynn said of Snowden during a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/03/07/287037148/transcript-interview-with-lt-gen-michael-flynn" target="_blank">NPR</a> interview that aired last month. </p><p> Previously, Flynn served in the US Army and participated in tours that brought him to Grenada, Haiti, Afghanistan and Iraq.

If absolutely baseless notations towards Russia will continue, if there are attempts to pressure us with economic leverage, then we may reevaluate the situation.”</em> </p><p> Lavrov has advised the US to “<em>discipline those whom they brought to power in Ukraine</em>” instead of sanctioning Moscow. </p><p> </p><p> He stated that despite declaring themselves “<em>winners of the democratic revolution</em>,” the current government in Kiev is based “<em>on a coalition which includes candid radicals and extremists, condemned even by the EU back in 2012 when the Svoboda party first made it to parliament.”</em> <br></p><p> <br> “<em>But now the Europeans are shyly forgetting about that and cooperate with those same people</em>,” Lavrov added. <br><br> The minister stressed the need to establish a direct dialogue between the coup-imposed Ukrainian authorities and protestors in the nation's southeast in order to solve the crisis in the country. <br><br> “<em>The role of Russia, the US, and Europe, or any other interested state, isn’t about blanching one of sides of the Ukrainian conflict,</em>” he said. </p><p> Lavrov also stated that Moscow has made an attempt to establish a dialogue by proposing a ‘round table’ discussion between Kiev and representatives of the southeastern regions within the framework of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). <br><br> “<em>However, the US and EU representatives have blocked this initiative,”</em> he stressed. “<em>This is sad. We’ll continue to call for the full implementation of the Geneva Declaration, which our partners are trying to distance themselves from.”</em> <br><br> As for the OSCE observers who are still being held by anti-Kiev protesters in the town of Slavyansk, Russia is “urging for them to be released,” Lavrov said. </p><p> </p><p> “<em>But we cannot decide for the self-defense forces</em>,” he added. “<em>Those people live under a constant threat coming from Kiev that the military and armored vehicles will be used against them; under constant threat from the extremists.”</em> <br><br> Southeastern Ukraine has been gripped by ongoing protests, with the majority of its Russian-speaking population refusing to recognize the new authorities in Kiev, who took the reins via a military coup powered by far-right radicals. <br><br> Activists in Donetsk, Lugansk, and other regions have seized government buildings and are demanding a referendum on federalization. <br><br> Despite failing to provide any proof, Washington continues to blame Moscow for masterminding the uprising in Ukraine's southeast. <br><br> The US and its allies have already imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia, targeting individual politicians and businessmen, as well as several companies. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156012-oklahoma-botched-execution-review/</guid><title><![CDATA[Oklahoma governor orders review of botched execution]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156012-oklahoma-botched-execution-review/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/c0/00/oklahoma-botched-execution-review.jpg" title="Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin (Reuters)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:30:35 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/16/c0/00/oklahoma-botched-execution-review.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Oklahoma Gov.

I believe the death penalty is an appropriate response and punishment to those who commit heinous crimes against their fellow men and women,”</em> the Republican governor said at a press conference Tuesday night. <em>“However, I also believe the state needs to be certain of its protocols and its procedures for executions, and that they work.”</em> </p><p> Clayton D. Lockett, 38, was <a href="http://rt.com/usa/155764-controversial-oklahoma-execution-wrong/"> scheduled to be executed</a> at 6pm local time Tuesday with a combination of lethal drugs, details of which were kept secret despite a flurry of court challenges and commentary from Oklahoma lawmakers in the weeks leading up to Lockett’s death. <a href="http://rt.com/usa/oklahoma-lethal-execution-drugs-905/">The state said in advance</a> it would use a combination of the sedative midazolam, the muscle relaxer pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride in the lethal injection procedure. </p><p> But the execution by lethal injection soon went wrong. The execution officially began at 6:23pm, but was cancelled because Lockett was still moving at 6:37 and looked up to say, <em>“Something’s wrong.”</em> </p><p> Department of Corrections officials said at a press conference immediately following the would-be execution that Lockett had blown a vein and that they are not sure where the drugs went in his body, or how much of the injection his body absorbed. Lockett died of a heart attack moments after his convulsion began. </p><p> The independent review will look into Lockett’s cause of death, whether or not the Department of Corrections followed the current protocol for executions and develop recommendations to improve execution protocols for the Department of Corrections, Fallin said at the press conference. Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Thompson will head up the investigation, which will also employ an independent pathologist to determine the cause of death. </p><p> Lockett was convicted of the 1999 kidnapping, rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman, who had been buried alive, MSNBC reports. Charles Warner, who was also scheduled to be executed Tuesday night, was convicted of raping and killing his girlfriend’s 11-month-old daughter in 1997. Fallin granted Warner a stay of execution until at least May 13. </p><p> <em>“I have not given Commissioner Thompson a deadline to complete the review. If he has not completed the review by May 13, an additional stay will be issued at that time,”</em> Fallin said. <em>“If there are adjustments that he needs to make or that need to be made to the state’s execution protocols, those adjustments will be made.”</em> </p><p> She went on to add, <em>“Charles Warner also had his day in court. He committed a horrible crime: physical abuse, rape and murder of an 11-month-old baby. His fellow Oklahomans have sentenced him to death, and we expect that sentence to be carried out as required by law.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156000-fcc-wheeler-blog-franken/</guid><title><![CDATA[FCC chairman stands by proposed net neutrality rules]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156000-fcc-wheeler-blog-franken/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/00/00/net-neutrality-figh.jpg" title="U.S. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler (Reuters / Jason Reed)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:12:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/16/00/00/net-neutrality-figh.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The chairman of the United States Federal Communication Commission is continuing to stand by a proposal concerning the future of the so-called “Open Internet” this week despite ongoing criticism.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/00/00/net-neutrality-figh.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler (Reuters / Jason Reed)" /> <p> In the midst of a cloud of negative attention surrounding a draft Open Internet Notice of Proposed Rulemaking document being considered by the FCC, the agency’s chairman, Thomas Wheeler, again attempted to quell concerns. </p><p> According to a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/blog/finding-best-path-forward-protect-open-internet" target="_blank">blog post</a> authored by Wheeler published on the FCC’s official blog on Tuesday, the chairman is committed to making sure proposed open internet rules won’t drastically erode the concept of net neutrality as critics have suggested. </p><p> Skeptics have voiced concerns that, if adopted, the draft document’s rules would let Internet Service Providers transmit data to end-users more quickly if the applicable content producers pay more to the ISPs. </p><p> Such concerns, Wheeler wrote on Tuesday, miss the point. <em>“The proposed rule is built to ensure that everyone has access to an Internet that is sufficiently robust to enable consumers to access the content, services and applications they demand, as well as an Internet that offers innovators and edge providers the ability to offer new products and services,”</em> he wrote. </p><p> Approval of these guidelines would not create a “<em>fast lane</em>” for the web as some have suggested, Wheeler wrote, and any attempts to do as much would be “<em>shut down</em>” by the FCC. </p><p> <em>“At the heart of the proposed NPRM is the assurance that it won’t be possible for an Internet provider to degrade the service available to all,”</em> Wheeler wrote. <em>“Let me re-emphasize that: the Internet will remain like it is today, an open pathway. If a broadband provider (ISP) acts in a manner that keeps users from effectively taking advantage of that pathway then it should be a violation of the Open Internet rules.”</em> </p><p> On Wednesday, Wheeler told the audience at the annual meeting of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association in Los Angeles that “<em>reports that we are gutting the Open Internet rules are incorrect</em>,” according to <a href="http://time.com/82409/wheeler-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">TIME</a>. </p><p> <em>“If you read some of the press accounts about what we propose to do, those of you who oppose net neutrality might feel like a celebration was in order,”</em> Wheeler said. <em>“Reports that we are gutting the Open Internet rules are incorrect. I am here to say ‘wait a minute.’ Put away the party hats.”</em> </p><p> <em>"Let me be clear. If someone acts to divide the Internet between 'haves' and 'have-nots,' we will use every power at our disposal to stop it,"</em> Wheeler insisted. </p><p> In the midst of a wave of criticism that erupted last week, Wheeler responded at the time that, <em>“To be very direct, the proposal would establish that behavior harmful to consumers or competition by limiting the openness of the Internet will not be permitted.”</em> </p><p> First, however, the five-person FCC board will have to decide if they want to move forward with the guidelines presented to them last week. Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/29/us-usa-internet-fcc-idUSBREA3S18W20140429?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews" target="_blank">reported</a> that the agency will vote on May 15 on Wheeler’s proposed rules. In the meantime, though, the FCC will likely see criticism only continue to mount up: earlier this week, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minnesota) became the latest American lawmaker to oppose Wheeler’s proposal, and wrote in a letter to the chairman that his plan to let companies pay for preferential access to ISPS and ergo internet customers would “<em>destroy</em>” the concept of net neutrality. </p><p> "<em>Your proposal would grant Verizon, Comcast, and other ISPs the power to pick winners and losers on the Internet, which violates core Net neutrality principles that you have publicly supported in the past. Although you claim that this proposal is not a ‘turnaround,’ it is difficult to understand how it does not flatly contradict your own Commission's Open Internet Order</em>,” Franken wrote, according to <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/franken-says-fcc-net-neutrality-would-destroy-open-internet/" target="_blank">CNET</a>. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/156028-russia-sues-eu-energy/</guid><title><![CDATA[Russia sues EU over ‘Third Energy Package’ - report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/156028-russia-sues-eu-energy/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/c0/00/russia-sues-the-eu-over-the-__third-energy-package__.jpg" title="Reuters / Yury Maltsev"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:11:17 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/17/c0/00/russia-sues-the-eu-over-the-__third-energy-package__.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Russia has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the EU's so-called 'Third Energy Package,' according to media reports.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/c0/00/russia-sues-the-eu-over-the-__third-energy-package__.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Yury Maltsev" /> <p> <em>“This procedure is provided for in the rules of the Organization,” a source said, adding that “Russia sent a note to the EU Mission at the WTO and notified the WTO Secretariat thereof,”</em> Itar-Tass news agency reported. </p><p> A second news agency, Interfax, stated that a <em>“source close to WTO”</em> spoke of <em>“the start [of a] court examination.”</em> The agency said it obtained confirmation from the director of the Ministry of Economic Development’s department of trade negotiations, Maksim Medvedkov. </p><p> Signed in 2007, the Third Energy Package outlines a set of rules regulating the European gas and electricity market. The European Commission insists the Third Energy Package was aimed at increasing competition on the energy market, allowing other players to join the sector and liberalizing energy prices. </p><p> One of the core elements prohibits a single company from both owning and operating a gas pipeline and contains rules on third party access to the natural oil transportation grid. </p><p> <em>“These and other elements of the Third Energy Package, in the opinion of Russia, contradict the obligations of the EU in WTO on basic principles of non-discrimination and market access...the Third Energy Package creates serious obstacles to ensure a stable supply of Russian gas to the EU, including a threat to the construction of new transport infrastructure, for example, in the framework of the ‘South Stream,'”</em> Medvedkov told Interfax. </p><p> Moscow broke ground on the South Stream project after securing agreements with intergovernmental agreements with all countries which the pipeline would pass through: Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, and Croatia. </p><p> The Third Energy regulation mandates 50 percent of the pipeline can be operated by Russia's Gazprom, but the other 50 percent must be operated by a third party, a condition Russian energy ministers do not accept, as Gazprom is the only company that has the right to export gas via pipeline. </p><p> Russian President Vladimir Putin previously stated that the "Third Energy Package" and other documents “should not be backdated to the contracts that were signed before the decision on the Third Energy Package came into force.” </p><p> Medvedkov has stressed that Russia has unsuccessfully tried to solve <em>“emerging problems”</em> on a bilateral level. </p><p> Now, under WTO rules, Russia and the EU have 60 days to hold joint consultations. If no solution is found during this time, Moscow can demand the right to initiate the creation of a group of independent arbitrators to look into the case. </p><p> However, Medvedkov has not ruled out the possibility of Russia and the EU reaching an agreement during consultations. </p><p> <em>“We do not aim to have legal proceedings with Brussels for the sake of the judicial process, we want to ensure predictable conditions for export to the EU under WTO rules,”</em> he said. </p><p> The Third Energy Package is a set of regulations for an internal gas and electricity market in the European Union. Its purpose is to further expand the gas and electricity markets in the European Union. The package was proposed by the European Commission in September 2007 and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in July 2009. It entered into force on September 3, 2009. </p><p> In late 2013, Russia filed a lawsuit against the EU over energy adjustments. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155996-half-americans-polluted-air/</guid><title><![CDATA[Nearly half of Americans live in areas with heavily polluted air]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155996-half-americans-polluted-air/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/c0/00/air_pollution_levels_are_unhealthy_to_breathe.jpg" title="Smoke is released into the sky at the ConocoPhillips oil refinery in San Pedro, California (Reuters/Bret Hartman )"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 19:24:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/15/c0/00/air_pollution_levels_are_unhealthy_to_breathe.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Up to 150 million people – almost half of all Americans – live in areas where air pollution levels are unhealthy to breathe, the American Lung Association has revealed in its newest report.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/c0/00/air_pollution_levels_are_unhealthy_to_breathe.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Smoke is released into the sky at the ConocoPhillips oil refinery in San Pedro, California (Reuters/Bret Hartman )" /> <p> According to the health organization’s 15th annual 'State of the Air' report, a total of 147.6 million people across the US live in counties with <em>“unhealthful levels of either ozone or particle pollution.”</em> This figure is almost 16 million more than in the 2013 report, in which the organization analyzed pollution levels from 2009, 2010, and 2011. </p><p> State of the Air 2014 focused on the nation’s air quality between 2010 and 2012. </p><p> California towns occupied the top five metropolitan areas with the highest air pollution, with Los Angeles being among the “leaders” in all three categories – by ozone (the most widespread air pollutant), year-round particle pollution, and short-term particle pollution. </p><p> Los Angeles remained the city with the worst ozone pollution problem, and had slightly more days of high ozone levels in 2010-2012. </p><p> These pollutants, the report stresses, remain a <em>“pervasive health threat.”</em> Studies show that particle pollution (a mixture of tiny solids and liquids in the air) and dangerous levels of ozone lead to an increased risk of heart disease, lung cancer, and asthma attacks. </p><p> Though America's overall air quality has improved compared to previous years, levels of ozone (smog) are much worse, the American Lung Association said. </p><p> <em>“Twenty-two of the 25 most ozone-polluted cities in the 2014 report – including Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago – had more high ozone days on average when compared to the 2013 report,”</em> it was revealed in the report. </p><p> Houston, Washington-Baltimore, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Philadelphia are also among those cities with the worst ozone problems. </p><p> The organization links the rise in ozone levels with a changing climate and warmer temperatures during those years. </p><p> <em>“Weather played a factor,"</em> the report said. <em>"The warmer summers in 2010 and 2012 contributed to higher ozone readings and more frequent ozone days. Sunlight and heat create conditions that increase the risk of high ozone levels."</em> </p><p> There are, however, four cities in the US where the air was clean of ozone and short-term particle pollution. They were also on the list of the cleanest cities for year-round particle pollution. According to the report, the cleanest cities are Bangor (ME), Bismarck (ND), Cape Coral-Fort Myers (FL) and Salinas (CA). </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156016-lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail/</guid><title><![CDATA[Huge fire erupts in Virginia following train derailment (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156016-lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/00/00/lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail.jpg" title="Screenshot from youtube.com/channel/UCGuTdI5_Zv0CLDXLJcYrlEw"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 19:18:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/17/00/00/lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A train derailed in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia Wednesday afternoon, causing a major fire to erupt at the scene of the accident.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/00/00/lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Screenshot from youtube.com/channel/UCGuTdI5_Zv0CLDXLJcYrlEw" /> <p> Local ABC affiliate WSET News reported that the derailment occurred at around 2 p.m. in the afternoon adjacent to the James River, and eye-witnesses say that before long the area was cloaked in heavy black smoke and flames extending as high as 80-feet into the air. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YA4Mir-Wo9E" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> Lynchburg’s News and Advance paper reported that the train did not contain passenger cars, but was rather a tube car train, potentially carrying chemicals, according to city fire marshal Thomas Goode. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Wow.

Wall Street Journal reporter Kristine Peterson <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/04/30/gop-senators-push-for-tougher-response-to-putin/" target="_blank">added</a> Wednesday morning that the military aspect of the proposal, if approved, would require the White House to substantially increase US and NATO support for the armed forces of allied Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, as well as accelerate implementation of missile defense in Europe. </p><p> On Monday this week, the White House imposed additional sanctions on Russia. Those sanctions targeted seven Russian government officials and 17 companies closely tied with Russia’s Pres. Vladimir Putin. </p><p> <em>“Since April 17, Russia has done nothing to meet its Geneva commitments and in fact has further escalated the crisis,”</em> White House press secretary Jay Carney <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/04/28/statement-press-secretary-ukraine"> said</a> on Monday this week. <em>“Russia’s involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable.”</em> </p><p> <em>“The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally; the goal is to change his calculus, to encourage him to walk the walk, not just talk the talk</em>,” Obama said. </p><p> <em>“I think what is happening now shows us who really was mastering the process from the beginning,”</em> Pres. Putin <a href="http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/">said</a> in response this week<em>. “But in the beginning, the United States preferred to remain in the shadow.”</em> </p><p> The Kremlin fired back at first, and said Russia would not be hurt by the sanctions. Now just days later, conservative members of Congress are saying it’s time for Uncle Sam to up the ante. </p><p> <em>“What we’ve seen from the administration is a lot of rhetoric,”</em> Sen.Bob Corker(R-Tennessee) said Wednesday morning, according to the Journal. </p><p> <em>"Until Putin feels the real pain of sanctions targeting entities like Gazprom, which the Kremlin uses to coerce Ukraine <a href="http://www.reuters.com/places/ukraine?lc=int_mb_1001"></a>and other neighbors, as well as some significant financial institutions, I don't think diplomacy will change Russian behavior and de-escalate this crisis,"</em> he said in a statement. </p><p> Sen. Dan Coats (R-Indiana) added in his own remarks that <em>“The lack of a forceful, effective response by the administration and Western leaders has given Putin little reason to expect that further aggression will be punished."</em> </p><p> <em>“We are introducing tough diplomatic, economic and financial sanctions, and I am hopeful that President Obama will support our effort,”</em> Coats said. </p><p> Washington has blamed Moscow for encouraging a recent uprising in eastern Ukraine and the nearby peninsula of Crimea that has displaced several local governments and imposed pro-Russian officials in their place. The recent Geneva treaty was signed with the goal of relaxing tensions in the region ahead of upcoming elections in Ukraine being held to replace the country’s recently ousted president Viktor Yanukovych, both leaders in both the US and Russia have accused one another of failing to abide by those terms. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156004-georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare/</guid><title><![CDATA[Georgia to demand drug tests for welfare recipients]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156004-georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.jpg" title="Georgia Governor Nathan Deal (Reuters / Tami Chappell)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 18:49:29 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed a bill on Tuesday that requires drug testing for some welfare applicants – and makes them foot the bill as well.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Georgia Governor Nathan Deal (Reuters / Tami Chappell)" /> <p> According to local NBC affiliate WXIA, the new law will place the fate of a welfare/food stamp applicant in the hands of state employees, who will determine whether or not a drug test is necessary. Generally, this decision would be made by taking into account an individual’s police record, demeanor, reasons for termination from employment, and any missed appointments. </p><p> On Monday, the day before Deal signed the legislation into law, the governor described the challenges facing the proposal that ultimately won his signature. </p><p> <em>"You're trying to balance two competing forces,”</em> he told WXIA. <em>“First is the right of the individual if they qualify to be given assistance in terms of food stamps. On the other hand, the right of the taxpayer not to be putting money in the hands of those abusing drugs. So it's a delicate balance of social issues.”</em> </p><p> The bill has been dubbed <em>“the toughest in the nation when it comes to public assistance”</em> by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, but supporters claim that it ensures anyone receiving taxpayer money is doing so fairly. </p><p> <em>“We passed a bill that simply insists on some level of personal responsibility of people who receive public funds for their support and livelihood,”</em> said state Speaker of the House David Ralston (R). </p><p> Opponents, however, argue that since the state increasingly uses the internet and the phone to manage applications, officials don’t have the kind of in-person interaction necessary to validate claims of reasonable suspicion that require a drug test. </p><p> Additionally, the bill forces applicants to pay for their drug exam – regardless of whether or not they test positive for anything – and places what opponents see as yet another obstacle in the way of the state’s poorest residents. </p><p> <em>"It's a badly flawed bill,"</em> Debbie Seagraves of Georgia’s American Civil Liberties Union said to Reuters. <em>"It will be challenged.”</em> </p><p> <em>"It's one thing for a judge, or district attorney, or police officer to judge what's reasonable suspicion,”</em> added Sen. Vincent Ford (D) to WXIA. <em>“But giving it to an overworked bureaucrat? I think it is bottom line, unfair.”</em> </p><p> As noted by Reuters, other states have tried to implement like-minded bills only to see them fall by the wayside. Last year, a federal judge struck down a similar bill, ruling it violated applicants’ constitutional rights against unreasonable search. Meanwhile, the Republican governor of North Carolina vetoed a drug-testing bill in 2013, arguing it had generated no tangible benefits in other states. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155984-stop-search-police-uk/</guid><title><![CDATA[UK Home Secretary urges ‘illegal’ stop and search practice overhaul]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155984-stop-search-police-uk/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.jpg" title="Reuters/Andrew Winning"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 18:15:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK Home Secretary Theresa May has called for an overhaul of police stop and search powers, telling the House of Commons that as many as 250,000 illegal stop and searches may have been undertaken last year.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Andrew Winning" /> <p> May announced plans to change the law, suggesting a review of all stop and search training, and making officers undertake an assessment of their awareness of the practice rules. </p><p> She added that if the number of stop and searches taking place did not drop then she would start making calls for a change to the law. </p><p> <em>“Nobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police,”</em> May told MPs. </p><p> Black people are seven times more likely to be stopped by police than white people. Additionally, only 10 percent of searches actually result in arrest, according to a recent study by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. </p><p> Police are presently allowed to stop somebody only if there are reasonable grounds upon which to suspect that an individual is carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property, or something which could be used to commit a crime, e.g. a crowbar. </p><p> May demanded clarity on what constituted ‘reasonable grounds,’ as well as the opening of records for public scrutiny and <em>“unconscious bias awareness training”</em> to reduce the risk of discrimination. </p><p> As evidence of the necessity for a reform package, May cited the recent study by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. Its conclusions showed that with 27 percent of stop and search records examined, there were no reasonable grounds upon which to search people, despite a supervisor having given the green light for searches to take place. </p><p> <em>”If the HMIC sample is accurate, that means more than a quarter of the million or so stops carried out under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act last year could have been illegal,”</em> stated May. </p><p> The Labour Party said that May’s plans do not go far enough. </p><p> Her opposition counterpart, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper asked her: <em>“Why aren't you banning the use of targets given to police officers to stop and search a certain number of people?”</em> Cooper also questioned why the guidance on race discrimination didn’t have a statutory basis and why there was no insistence that all forces abide by case law instead of just “some.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155980-fidel-salinas-anonymous-indicted/</guid><title><![CDATA[FBI may put alleged Anonymous member behind bars for 440 years]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155980-fidel-salinas-anonymous-indicted/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/c0/00/fidel_salinas.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Raul Arboleda"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 17:19:30 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/14/c0/00/fidel_salinas.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A man accused of being a member of the amorphous hacktivist movement Anonymous now faces a total of 44 charges after federal investigators announced on Tuesday the filing of second superseding indictment against Fidel Salinas of Donna, Texas.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/c0/00/fidel_salinas.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Raul Arboleda" /> <p> Salinas, 27, was first charged last October with one count of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act after a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas said he intentionally tried to hack into the computer system of Hidalgo County practically two years earlier. A superseding indictment was unsealed earlier this month on April 2 and introduced 15 additional counts against Salinas, but this week the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that even more charges have since been brought. </p><p> The FBI <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/sanantonio/press-releases/2014/alleged-anonymous-computer-hacker-charged-with-18-counts-of-cyberstalking" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on Tuesday that Salinas now faces a total of 44 charges due to his supposed role in attempting to hack computer systems belonging to Hidalgo County, the La Joya Independent School District and The Monitor newspaper of McAllen, TX, as well as the computer of an unnamed female victim he is alleged to have cyber-stalked at least 18 times in December 2011. </p><p> Authorities say that Salinas conspired with members of the internationally-dispersed hacktivist collective Anonymous to coordinate these attacks, and spent at least six months conversing with others in a chat room affiliated with the group’s Operation Anti-Security, or Antisec, faction. </p><p> Salinas pleaded not guilty in October 2013 to the single-count indictment related to the Hidalgo County hack and was scheduled to stand trial in March, but proceedings were continuously put on hold until earlier this month when the first superseding indictment was unsealed on April 2 and he was further accused of 15 new counts involving the county computer system, the school district and The Monitor. Salinas again pleaded not guilty to all counts at an arraignment on April 10, but authorities have now confirmed that additional charges have been introduced in a second superseding indictment. </p><p> In Tuesday’s statement, the FBI said: <em>"Salinas faces up to 10 years in federal prison on each of the charges, upon conviction."</em> If correct, then prosecutors could seek upwards of 440 years. </p><p> The FBI's announcement was absent specific details about the latest charges, but those were made public on Wednesday afternoon when the newest indictment was uploaded to the PACER court records site. </p><p> <em>“According to the allegations, between Dec. 23-29, 2011, Salinas had the intent to harass and intimidate a female victim. Allegedly, he repeatedly e-mailed her, attempted to gain unauthorized access to her website, made submissions through a contact form on that site and tried to open user accounts without her consent,</em>” the FBI said in Tuesday’s statement. </p><p> <em>“The indictment lists his alleged attempts to stalk her and hack into her website. According to the indictment, he repeatedly did so late at night and early in the morning, with his stalking attempts or messages sometimes occurring less than one minute apart from each other. He allegedly did so as part of a conspiracy or agreement with at least one other person, according to the charges.”</em> </p><p> Earlier this month, legal counsel for Salinas told the Associated Press that prosecutors wouldn’t be able to persevere in court. </p><p> <em>“They can’t make a case against my client,”</em> attorney Alma Garza told the <a href="http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2014-04-10/south-texas-man-accused-hacking-attempts" target="_blank">AP</a>, adding that the case against Salinas has dragged on for two years. </p><p> Indeed, the trove of court documents that is accessible suggests that the authorities have been pursuing charges against Salinas for some time already. The first document in Salinas’ criminal docket is dated September 11, 2013 and consists of a criminal complaint filed by FBI Special Agent Truoung Nguyen containing allegations about alleged hacks from early 2012. </p><p> <iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/221201246/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="undefined" id="doc_16902" name="doc_16902" frameborder="0" height="600" scrolling="no" width="100%"></iframe> </p><p> According to Special Agent Nguyen, authorities narrowed in on their target that January after investigators linked an attempt to breach the site of Hidalgo County with a computer within a residence where Salinas was staying. Salinas <em>“made over 14,000 attempts to log into their website server,”</em> Nguyen charged, in turn slowing down the system for administrators and visitors alike and eventually requiring the county to hire tech specialists. In all, the hack is alleged to have cost Hidalgo County $10,620.32, according to the Sept. 2013 complaint. </p><p> Nguyen said the IP address of the computer used by Salinas was responsible for those thousands of attempted intrusions, and a search warrant executed a week after the hack occurred ended with the FBI seizing his laptops and recovering forensic evidence that linked him to the attacks. </p><p> Salinas was interviewed by FBI Special Agent Christopher Wallingsford several months later in September 2012 and admitted during that meeting and at a later one that he used a program on his computer to attempt to gain administrative access to the site, but that his efforts were to test the network’s security. </p><p> <em>“Salinas claimed that he was not trying to do anything illegal but thought that if he gained access [he] would passed on that information to the Hidalgo County Network Administrator as a courtesy,”</em> the complaint alleged. </p><p> Days after the Hidalgo breach landed him in handcuffs and the loss of his computers, Salinas authored an angry diatribe on his Facebook page believed to be directed at Hidalgo. </p><p> <em>“Fuck you corrupt officials and politicians,”</em> Salinas wrote. <em>“When someone tries to give you advice that your servers aren’t secure and said person doesn’t modify, access or download and ‘redistricted’ information. I believe you say thank you instead of being afraid of what you don’t know by getting an invalid warrant, arresting and wrongfully hijacking all his electronics.”</em> </p><p> Salinas, authorities say, ended the diatribe with a phrase commonly used within Anonymous: “<em>We do not forgive, we do not forget.”</em> </p><p> When the first superseding indictment was unveiled earlier this month, the FBI accused Salinas of 15 additional counts related to that hack and others, and introduced an overt fact to that charges: On or about June 6, 2011, Salinas entered the AntiSec chatroom affiliated with Anonymous. The hacktivist group’s name is otherwise absent from the indictment, except to note that Salinas joined a separate chatroom associated with the group six months later. </p><p> The FBI’s announcement this week did not blame Anonymous for the hacks per se, but instead acknowledged just that <em>“Salinas is allegedly linked to the computer-hacking group Anonymous.”</em> According to first superseding indictment, Salinas conducted a method of hack know as a SQL-injection against the targeted sites starting in November 2011. </p><p> With regards to the latest charged pertaining to alleged counts of cyber-stalking, authorities say Salinas did so with the aid of another party, but whether they believe those events were associated with Anonymous is not clear. The forensic examination of his computers seized in early 2012 reportedly contained logs from Anonymous-related chatrooms dating back to mid-2011, however, but reference to Salinas’ alleged role with AntiSec raises one other issue of note: authorities say Salinas began conversing with other AntiSec members on June 6, 2011 — hours before authorities arrested the Anonymous hacker responsible for that faction, Hector Xavier Monsegur, and recruited him as a federal informant. Monsegur is expected to be sentenced next week in New York City, but half-a-dozen hearings have previously been adjourned due to his ongoing cooperation with investigators. </p><p> The indictment made public on Wednesday now combines all charges against Salinas as found by the grand jury: counts one and two pertain to attempting to breach the county, school district and newspaper sites; count three alleges he conspired with others to use a computer “to cause emotional distress” to the female victim, identified only as “Y.V.”; count four involves an attempted hack of Y.V’s computer; counts five through 22 allege Salinas attempted to distress the victim multiple times over the internet on his own; 33 through 37 relate to the allege attempts to hack the woman’s computer; counts 38 through 43 pertain to attempting to hack the three other sites between November 2011 and January 2012 and count 44 accuses Salinas of attempting to recklessly cause damage to the Hidalgo County sight. </p><p> Counts one, two, four and 23 through 44 are all violations of the federal CFAA hacking law. Salinas is now scheduled to be arraigned on May 8 before Magistrate Judge Peter E. Ormsby. </p><p> <iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/221197449/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-a2zvhepxdcxdo17v7cp&amp;show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.772922022279349" id="doc_32174" name="doc_32174" frameborder="0" height="600" scrolling="no" width="100%"></iframe> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155968-us-economy-grow-snail/</guid><title><![CDATA[US economy grows at snail’s pace in first quarter, expands 0.1%]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155968-us-economy-grow-snail/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/00/00/us-economy-grow-snail.jpg" title="Reuters / Enrique Castro-Mendivil"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 17:05:41 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/14/00/00/us-economy-grow-snail.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The US economy came to a near standstill in the first quarter of 2014, growing at one of its weakest paces since 2012.

Exports fell at a rate of 7.6 percent in the first quarter – the biggest fall since the recession ended. The frigid weather could be to blame for less consumer spending, which only increased at a rate of 0.4 percent. <br><br> The slowdown is in stark contrast to the 3.4 percent economic expansion that the US enjoyed in the second half of 2013. <br><br> “We’ve been living in sub-3 percent land, and people have gotten used to that as the new normal. But it's not. It's anemic,” Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, told The New York Times. <br><br> America's economy slowed drastically in the first quarter of 2014, as wintry weather depressed corporate spending and housing sector activity. Smaller additions to inventories by farmers and businesses also held back growth. <br><br> Business spending dropped 2.1 percent between January and March, as companies spent less on buildings, equipment, and intellectual property. <br><br> Federal spending is set to grow in 2014, which could help offset the lackluster first quarter growth. Most economists are predicting an overall growth of between 2.5 and three percent. <br><br> Later on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will finish its two-day meeting and will likely announce another $10 billion in monthly bond purchases as part of its planned 'tapering’ of stimulus spending. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155992-iraq-elections-winner-corrupt/</guid><title><![CDATA[Iraqi elections: 'Most corrupted one will be the winner']]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155992-iraq-elections-winner-corrupt/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/15/80/00/iraq-elections-winner-corrupt.jpg" title="Photo by Nadezhda Kevorkova"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:39:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/15/80/00/iraq-elections-winner-corrupt.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The one who stole more Iraqi money is in a position to use the election and probably he will win, Muhavad Husam al Dine Al Bayati, Head of the Prime Minister office, told RT’s Nadezhda Kevorkova.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/15/80/00/iraq-elections-winner-corrupt.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo by Nadezhda Kevorkova" /> <p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>Who will be the winner in the parliamentary elections?</em> </p><p> <strong>Muhavad Husam al Dine Al Bayati</strong>: The most corrupted one will be the winner. I do not know who exactly will win. But I can judge that the one who stole more Iraqi money is in position to use the election and probably he will win. And the one who controls the army and the power will win. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>So if the block of the prime minister will win he will be such a person?</em> </p><blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> On April 30 Iraq is holding its first parliamentary elections since the withdrawal of US troops. Sectarian tension in the country is extremely high, while Iraq itself is a fragmented state, and it affects the ongoing voting. Though security was increased significantly, two days before the elections were overshadowed by a wave of deadly attacks. </p> </blockquote><p> <strong>MB</strong>: As you know the corruption in this country is very huge. And there is a lot of money in the hands of some politicians not necessary only from the block of prime minister. There are so many other blocks that stole so much money from the country. They can buy votes and support from IHEC [the Independent High Electoral Commission which approved the voting system and the counting method for 2014 parliamentary elections]. The results will not be very clear. </p><p> We do not have foreign observers or people who are watching the elections. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>People say that 65 American observers came to Iraq especially for the elections, is it so?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: What can these 65 do? Can they work on the street? Can they go to the governorates? Can they go to the election boxes and see how people vote and how their votes are counted? No, they cannot. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>What does it mean, this absence of interest to the first Iraqi elections? Does it mean that the US wants to change Iraqi authorities once more?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: We cannot be sure. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>What will happen after the elections? Will the tension and frequency of terroristic attacks start to grow or not?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: I think there will be a new government; there will be new leaders who will be able to start reconciliation in the country and forget about the past, forget about the revenge going on now in this country which we can’t stand. We need some leaders in the cabinet and in the Parliament who can start real reconciliation. Also there must be real reorganization of the army to contain all Iraqis but not only one sect as it is now. And also we need the reorganization that is related to the economy of the country, so that we can make our economy effective and promote other sectors apart from oil to provide income for the country. Then the economic situation will change. Now we are depending only on oil. And if other sectors do not participate in the economy, this country can collapse. Over 92% of the income of Iraq comes from oil. In 70-80s around 35% of its income came from agriculture. So we are a one-sided economy now. This should not continue. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>Why are people in Iraq saying that during the American presence the situation was better than now?</em> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: Because people are getting harder. They lost their homes. When people lose their homes they go to be extremists. You know they tried to talk to 6 governorates one year in a civilized and peaceful way, but they didn’t pay any attention to them. So they went to be extremists. They used their arms instead of acting in a peaceful way (the demolishing of Iraqi refugees camps in Anbar province in Dec 2013 – RT). This is complicating the situation. Plus there is no real balance in the government organization among the different sects. This made an impression on the Sunnis that they are oppressed and neglected. The distance between al Maliki and the Sunni community became too big. There is no communication and detention started from that. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>Iraqi Christians are running away from Iraq, nobody knows the percentage of Christians in the country now, but some experts think that it is less than a tenth of this community in the past, is it so and is it only one-way ticket for them?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: Even more Sunnis are leaving the country than Christians. I cannot see Iraq without Christians. Iraq was the best place for Christians in the region before the American war. They were treated as real Iraqis. Now because of the terrorist activity, security and neglect by the government they left their homes, but I am sure that when the security is improved all the Iraqis will come back including the Sunnis. I know how much they love Iraq, especially the Christians. Even the Jewish people that left the country – all people who remember the bread of Iraq they never can forget it and they want to come back to see the place where they were born. Now it is a sectarian government, but when it will be civilized government all people will come back. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>What is the role of Iran?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: Iran is one who brought this government in – Maliki’s government. It has huge influence. Their influence here is much stronger than even the American one. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>If so who supports terrorists in Iraq if the role of Iran is so big?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: The support is coming from all over the world, from independent people, probably some organizations but not the governments. </p><p style="text-align: right;"> <em>Nadezda Kevorkova, Baghdad</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155988-colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules/</guid><title><![CDATA[Colorado trying to come up with new rules for edible marijuana]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155988-colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/40/00/colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules.jpg" title="Reuters/Jason Redmond"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:26:22 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/15/40/00/colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Following two recent deaths in Colorado believed to be linked to edible marijuana, state officials have decided to examine and rework regulations related to products such as pot cookies and brownies.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/40/00/colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Jason Redmond" /> <p> According to USA Today, officials will meet on Wednesday to <em>"discuss and consider reasonable amounts of active THC in retail marijuana products in proportion to product serving size."</em> </p><p> Currently, Colorado law states that 10 mg of THC – marijuana’s active ingredient – is equivalent to one serving of the drug, but edible products are not required to be sold in a single serving, nor does the law require pot producers split the package up into separate servings. As reported by the Associated Press, a single package of pot-infused food – sometimes as small as a piece of candy – could contain up to 10 servings of THC. </p><p> <em>"Basically, we are trying to figure out how to come up with a reasonable THC concentration or amount in edibles in proportion to product safety size,"</em> Dr. George Sam Wang of Children's Hospital Colorado told the AP. In the past, Wang has treated children who’d become sick after ingesting pot. </p><p> Earlier this month, NBC reported that a Denver man who shot and killed his wife was reportedly found to have eaten pot candy beforehand, though police said other medication could have been in his system. Police stated the man’s wife was on the phone with 911 asking for help since her husband was <em>“totally hallucinating”</em> and <em>“talking about the end of the world.”</em> By the time police arrived at the house, the wife had been killed with a shotgun. </p><p> In March, meanwhile, a 19-year-old college student from Wyoming died after jumping off the balcony of his hotel room. The student had reportedly eaten an entire pot cookie containing 65 mg of THC – more than six times the recommended dosage in a single serving. According to NBC, the store clerk who sold the cookie suggested breaking it into pieces instead of eating it all at once. </p><p> <em>"Coloradans are used to eating a whole cookie.

Another could be to mandate food to be individually wrapped by serving size. </p><p> So far, marijuana advocates are onboard the effort to take another look at regulations. </p><p> <em>"All of us want to make sure people are safe,"</em> Meg Collins of the Denver-based Cannabis Business Alliance, as well as a member of the task force, told the AP. <em>"The industry is stepping up and is looking at the best ways to educate and communicate to its customers safe ways to recreate with marijuana."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155948-mit-bitcoin-free-experiment/</guid><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin field day: MIT freshmen to get free cryptocurrency]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155948-mit-bitcoin-free-experiment/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/c0/00/mit-bitcoin-free-experiment.jpg" title="Reuters/Jim Urquhart "/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:04:52 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/12/c0/00/mit-bitcoin-free-experiment.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Over 4,500 undergrads will each get $100 worth of bitcoin for free once they come back to school this fall as two MIT students plan to conduct the world's largest experiment with the virtual currency.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/c0/00/mit-bitcoin-free-experiment.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Jim Urquhart " /> <p> <em>"We decided to announce this project now to give students lead time,"</em> Dan Elitzer, founder and president of the MIT Bitcoin Club, said in the <a href="http://bitcoin.mit.edu/announcing-the-mit-bitcoin-project/" target="_blank">release</a>. <em>"We want to issue a challenge to some of the brightest technical minds of a generation: When you step on to campus this fall, all of your classmates are going to have access to bitcoin; what are you going to build to give them interesting ways to use it?"</em> </p><p> The MIT Bitcoin Project, as it is called, became possible after Elitzer, who is also an MBA student at MIT's Sloan School of Management, and Jeremy Rubin, 19, - he studies electrical engineering and computer science - raised more than $500,000 in commitments from about 25 donors, MIT alumni. </p><p> Should this experiment go ahead, it will make the MIT campus the first place in the world where it will be possible to have widespread access to bitcoin. </p><p> The project is aimed at building up an ecosystem for digital currencies. However, the two enthusiasts have no clue of how their fellow students – a total of 4,528 undergraduates - will use the bitcoin they will receive this fall. </p><p> It is hoped that such an experiment will spur academic and entrepreneurial activity within the university and give students and researchers a chance to develop bitcoin-related applications. </p><p> <em>“Giving students access to cryptocurrencies is analogous to providing them with internet access at the dawn of the internet era,”</em> said Rubin. </p><p> In the time left to the start of the experiment, Elitzer and Rubin plan to begin preparing the bitcoin ecosystem at MIT, which will involve <em>“working with members of the MIT Bitcoin Club to educate merchants around campus and help them set up to accept bitcoin payments.”</em> </p><p> The fall launch date is intended to give students the summer to work on bitcoin-related projects, Rubin explained. </p><p> <em>“What I’m hoping is that infrastructure gets sufficiently built around MIT that bitcoin actually becomes a useful commodity to have,”</em> Rubin said as cited by the Tech. <em>“I think that MIT should be absolutely the center of the bitcoin universe. As a school that’s a leader in technology and science fields … it’s kind of a shame that we’re not already at this point,”</em> he added. </p><p> The concept of the giveaway bitcoin, reportedly, was initially Rubin's idea that he shared with Elitzer in March. </p><p> The two have been working together to expand it. They originally wanted to give bitcoin to a control group. But Elitzer insisted that every single undergraduate student should take part in the experiment. </p><p> This is not the first bitcoin-related project for both Elitzer and Rubin. </p><p> In 2013, Rubin worked with three other undergraduates on a bitcoin-related project called Tidbit. That experiment, however, ran into trouble: it was subpoenaed by the New Jersey attorney general as part of a consumer fraud investigation. MIT has sent a letter to the New Jersey attorney general in support of Rubin, who is still fighting for the subpoena to be withdrawn. In fact, Rubin and Elitzer met in the fallout of the Tidbit subpoena. </p><p> As for Elitzer, he got interested in bitcoin after working at a non-profit organization, when he saw a potential for cryptocurrencies in countries where people may not have bank accounts. </p><p> Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and completely digital money. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. </p><p> Today, $5.6 billion dollars of bitcoin exist and are traded every day without a central bank, paper currency, or physical security. On April 30, one bitcoin amounts to $443.05. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155944-google-mining-education-app/</guid><title><![CDATA[Google no longer mining student Gmail accounts for targeted ads]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155944-google-mining-education-app/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/80/00/2google-mining-education-app.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Damein Meyer"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:51:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/12/80/00/2google-mining-education-app.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Google will no longer scan student and teacher Gmail messages or use data from Education apps for use in advertising following a legal firestorm that the policy violated privacy rights.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/80/00/2google-mining-education-app.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Damein Meyer" /> <p> The policy shift was first announced by Bram Bout, director of Google for Education, in a <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/protecting-students-with-google-apps.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Wednesday. According to Bout, Google has removed a toggle to enable and disable ads in the Apps for Education Administrator console. He noted that without the toggle, ads in the Apps for Education suite are now automatically turned off, and administrators will not be able to turn them back on. </p><p> The Mountain View, California-based tech giant company had been automatically blocking the ads unless administrators changed the controls. </p><p> Bout also noted that similar changes are being made <em>“for all our Google Apps customers, including Business, Government and for legacy users of the free version, and we’ll provide an update when the rollout is complete.”</em> </p><p> On Thursday, at 16:00 GMT, Bout will co-host a <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GoogleforEducation/posts#+GoogleforEducation/posts" target="_blank">Google hangout</a> to discuss the changes and answer questions. <br> Apps for Education is used by primary and secondary schools worldwide, delivering free online applications including Gmail, Docs, and Spreadsheet, among others. Around 30 million students, teachers and administrators use the service today, according to Google. </p><p> While none of those 30 million users were actually shown ads as a result of the service key word scans, their personal information was still collected by Google so that it could be employed for targeted marketing elsewhere online. </p><p> Although Apps for Education users are now free from such intrusive forms of marketing, everyday Gmail users will still see their emails scanned by an automated system for the sake of ads, customization and security. </p><p> Under its recently revamped terms of service, Google state that <em>"our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.”</em> </p><p> Students and other Gmail users sued Google last year in California, claiming the email scanning violated federal and state wiretap laws. According to the Wall Street Journal, that case spurred Google’s policy change. </p><p> During the litigation, Google admitted to scanning emails sent and received by students who attended schools using Apps for Education. Week magazine reported that such practices may violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a law which protects educational records. </p><p> The nine plaintiffs had hoped to file a “class action” suit to gain financial compensation for Gmail users, as well as to force the company to be more open about its policies. In March, however, US District Judge Lucy Koh rejected the move, which would have allowed the plaintiffs to pool their resources, exposed Google to billions of dollars of potential damages, and given them greater leverage to push for a settlement. </p><p> Instead, email users might have to file suit individually or in small groups, lowering claims and increasing the financial burden of pursuing legal action. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155900-superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Devastating’ implications of drug-resistant superbugs now a reality – WHO]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155900-superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/c0/00/superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance.jpg" title="Reuters/Leonhard Foeger"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:41:34 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0f/c0/00/superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Deadly antibiotic-resistant superbugs are a ‘serious threat’ to world health and no longer merely a prediction for the future, according to a new report by the World Health Organization (WHO). Previously treatable illnesses can now once again kill.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/c0/00/superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Leonhard Foeger" /> <p> <em>“The world is headed for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill,”</em> said Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's assistant director-general for health security. </p><p> The new resistance has the capacity to strike anyone, of any age, on a global scale according to the WHO <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/" target="_blank">report</a>, entitled ‘Antimicrobial resistance: global report on surveillance’, released on Wednesday. It’s the organization’s first ever global report on antibiotic resistance. </p><p> <em>“The implications will be devastating,”</em> stated Fukuda. </p><p> Data spanning 114 different countries was utilized in the study and superbug resistance was found in all regions of the world. The infections were even resistant to a class of antibiotic which fall into a category known as carbapenems – a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic considered one of the last resorts in the treatment of infectious bacterial diseases. </p><p> </p><p> Resistance to last-resort treatments for potentially deadly hospital infections caused by the common Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria have been found in all parts of the world, as has resistance to the most common drugs to treat urinary tract infections caused by E.coli, as well as last resort gonorrhea treatment in 10 developed countries – among them the UK. </p><p> One of the best knows superbugs is MRSA – a staph infection – which is estimated to kill some 19,000 people every year in the US and an equal number in Europe. A new <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/mrsa-spreads-in-households-1.15080" target="_blank">study</a> released last week showed that MRSA, commonly found in hospitals, has settled in a new stronghold – that is US homes, which are a “major reservoir” of a strain called USA300. </p><p> Experts have suggested that the resistance of superbugs stems from the overuse or misuse of antibiotics and <em>“threatens the achievements of modern medicine.”</em> </p><p> Antibiotic resistance is when bacteria adapt and change so that antibiotics no longer work in the treatment of the diseases. </p><p> </p><p> While it has been a prominent 21st century public health concern, the worries have previously remained confined to the realm of predictions rather than actual commentary on present conditions. Resistance was nil when drugs were first introduced to combat such diseases in the 1980s. However, there are now countries where drugs have no impact whatsoever in more than half of all patients. </p><p> <em>“Unless we take significant actions to improve efforts to prevent infections and also change how we produce, prescribe and use antibiotics, the world will lose more and more of these global public health goods and the implications will be devastating,”</em> Fukuda said. </p><p> In response to the WHO report, campaign group Antibiotic Action <em>“specifically”</em> called for steps to be taken. <br> They called for the <em>“establishment of a fully funded global mandatory surveillance program and global/region specific action plans to monitor and contain antimicrobial resistance,”</em> along with advocating strategies to counter the broad global availability of antibiotics. </p><p> <em>“The world needs to respond as it did to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. To do this, we need to be ambitious to succeed – moves such as a fully funded mandatory global surveillance program will document the size of the problem and funded public education will help minimize use – but these are just starting points,”</em> Laura Piddock, director of the group stated. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155976-storm-flooding-florida-alabama/</guid><title><![CDATA[Deadly storms cause massive flooding in Florida and Alabama (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155976-storm-flooding-florida-alabama/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/80/00/storm-flooding-florida-alabama.jpg" title="Photo from Twitter/@IndianaWxOnline"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:27:20 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/14/80/00/storm-flooding-florida-alabama.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />As a deadly weather front continued to make its way across the Southern United States late Tuesday and early Wednesday, both Florida and Alabama were struck with severe flooding that’s left at least one person dead.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/80/00/storm-flooding-florida-alabama.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo from Twitter/@IndianaWxOnline" /> <p> According to the Associated Press, rainfall in the Florida Panhandle – especially the area around Pensacola – and the coast of Alabama has been relentless, dropping well over a foot of rain in both states.

It would take the position the US has held since 1872.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/40/00/china-overtake-us-economy.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Kevin Lamarque" /> <p> Previous studies have suggested China could become the world's biggest economy by 2019. </p><p> Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese economy has contributed a quarter of total global growth. Between 2011-2014, China’s economy will account for 24 percent, according to IMF estimates. </p><p> In comparison the US economy will only show an increase of 7.6 percent over the same period. </p><p> The predictions are hard to calculate as the latest estimates are based on purchasing power parity. The index attempts to assess the size of an economy based on the assumption that prices of non-tradable goods and services are a lot lower in poorer countries, says the Financial Times (FT). </p><p> The evaluation process of the service may differ, as a haircut in China may cost much less than in the US, however its quality may differ as well. </p><p> The same problem touches upon the quality of tangible goods. A DVD player bought in China may be way cheaper than a US one, however there is no warranty that it will last longer than several months. Besides US goods are sold with far more consumer protection laws, which through more scrutiny and inspection, delivers a better product. </p><p> Another barrier in measuring the true size of the economy is the availability of trusty data, as China is controlled by a secretive authoritarian government that sometimes manipulates data for political purposes. </p><p> It has a huge amount of illegal and unaccounted for ‘shadow’ income sourced from corruption, a sex industry, numerous illegal street vendors, and other services sectors that are not counted in official statistics. Therefore the ‘shadow’ economy could be more than 20 times bigger than official figures report. </p><p> The Chinese economy may be 20 percent larger than official figures show, this it may have overtaken the US several years ago, says the FT. </p><p> Meanwhile the living standards of the average Chinese citizen are still far lower than those in many developing countries. </p><p> According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s economy ranked 93 in per capita purchasing power parity terms. That was just ahead of Turkmenistan and Albania but well behind Libya, Azerbaijan and Surinam. </p><p> That means that on average China’s 1.36 billion people are unlikely to catch up with Western living standards for many decades to come. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155960-presenting-lies-facts-propaganda-exposure/</guid><title><![CDATA[Who's really 'presenting lies as facts'?

(...) Consider the way RT manipulated a leaked telephone <strong><u>call involving former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.</u></strong> Through selective editing, the network made it <strong><u>appear that Tymoshenko advocated violence against Russia.</u></strong> Or the <strong><u>constant reference to any Ukrainian opposed to a Russian takeover of the country as a "terrorist."</u></strong> Or the <strong><u>unquestioning repetition of the ludicrous assertion last week that the United States has invested $5 billion in regime change in Ukraine.</u></strong> <strong><u>These are not facts, and they are not opinions</u></strong>. They are false claims, and when propaganda poses as news it creates real dangers and gives a green light to violence.” </p><p> How many FACTS does Mr. Stengel attempt to deny? Let us count: </p><p> - Yulia Tymoshenko herself has <a href="http://rt.com/news/tymoshenko-calls-destroy-russia-917/">confirmed</a> the authenticity of the conversation that included the following statements: “This is really beyond all boundaries. It's about time we grab our guns and kill those damned Russians together with their leader.” And “I would have found a way to kill those a***es. I hope I will be able to get all my connections involved. And I will use all of my means to make the entire world rise up, so that there wouldn't be even a scorched field left in Russia.” While there was indeed some controversy about a small portion of the recording being altered, Ms. Tymoshenko herself pointed to the source of the tape, not RT, as the guilty party, and the statements quoted above were not in question. Bottom line: if it appears that Ms. Tymoshenko is advocating violence against Russia and Russians – it’s because she blatantly is. </p><p> - Forgetting for a second the absolutely ludicrous supposition, even in theory, of a Russian “takeover” of Ukraine, RT refers those supportive of the current authorities in Kiev as “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGfCLpjEUzk&amp;feature=youtu.be">anti-autonomy,” “pro-unity protesters</a>” and “<a href="http://rt.com/news/155224-ukraine-football-fans-clashes/">pro-Kiev activists</a>.” But you know who is keen on throwing around the “terrorist” moniker? Why, that would be the newly-minted, US-supported Ukrainian government, applying the term <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27035196">to its own people</a> (source: BBC News), as it sends tanks against the anti-government protesters – something that even President Yanukovich, for all his faults, refused to do. </p><p> - Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was the one to <a href="http://youtu.be/U2fYcHLouXY">publicize</a> the $5 billion “investment” in Ukraine’s “European future,” framing it in terms of the United States’ support of Ukraine achieving preconditions for “its European aspirations.” Interestingly enough, that “European future” and those “European aspirations” by definition blatantly ignored and/or rejected the aspirations of the 37 percent of Ukrainians who desired closer relationship with Russia via a trade union, as opposed to the 39 percent in favor of <a href="http://kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=204&amp;page=2"> joining the EU</a> (source: Kiev International Institute of Sociology). How much of that $5 billion went to support the institutions that aided <strong><u>their</u></strong> interests and how much support did Ms. Nuland et al. lend to the <strong><u>democratically</u></strong>-elected president who represented them? Right. Not that anyone is particularly surprised. Wouldn't be the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/04/03/the-big-problem-with-the-cuban-twitter-plan/"> first time</a> that the US benignly “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/bolivias-president-expels-us-aid-agency/2013/05/01/a290899e-b28b-11e2-baf7-5bc2a9dc6f44_story.html">invested</a>” in “democracy” (sources: Washington Post). </p><p> </p><p> Now, how does <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c6HQpH7zWQ">throwing Molotov cocktails</a> (source: Sky News), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkzi6-zz55M">savagely beating officers</a>, and <a href="http://rt.com/news/police-officer-savaged-ukraine-865/">refusing medical aid</a> to the injured while taking over government buildings fit into your definition of “peaceful protesters”? There was indeed brutality on both sides of the barricades (which RT thoroughly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhBk8V-6seo">documented and aired</a>), but you have admit – police officers don’t die by the hand of peaceful demonstrators. </p><p> How is RT behind the “protesters hired snipers” assertions if those concerns were brought to light by the famous leaked (and confirmed <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/05/world/europe/ukraine-leaked-audio-recording/"> authentic</a> – source: CNN) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEgJ0oo3OA8">Ashton-Paet call</a>, by quoting a Maidan medic whose credibility they went to pains to establish? The statement that “there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition” came not from RT but the Estonian minister. </p><p> And why is the far-right, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SBo0akeDMY">neo-Nazi</a> threat in Ukraine being so flippantly dismissed despite being <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/178013/ukrainian-nationalism-heart-euromaidan"> documented</a> by dozens of Western mainstream media <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/svoboda-ministers-ukraine-new-government-far-right"> outlets</a> (sources: BBC Newsnight, The Nation, Channel 4 UK)? </p><p> The reason you’re seeing citations of sources right here, in the text, is so that it cannot be labeled as another “propaganda” piece full of RT’s own “false” reporting. Or does Mr. Stengel consider all media organizations that report inconvenient facts that challenge his reality to be propaganda outlets? It is very disappointing that a person of his position knows so very little of the reality of the situation in Ukraine, but it certainly explains a lot about the state of US foreign policy. </p><p> Facts are facts, Mr. Stengel. It’s too bad you can’t get your own straight. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155932-elections-in-iraq-blasts/</guid><title><![CDATA[The first post-occupation election in Iraq started with explosions]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155932-elections-in-iraq-blasts/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/11/c0/00/elections-in-iraq-blasts.jpg" title="Sheik Qais Khazaali, leader of the militant group Asaib Ahl Haq, shows his ink-stained finger as he votes during a parliamentary election in Baghdad April 30, 2014.

(Reuters)" /> <p> Five polling stations in Baghdad, Sadr City and Mosul came under attack with varying consequences. The Iraqi Ministry of Interior reported six people killed and 24 injured, but the figures quickly changed to two dozen dead. </p><p> In the morning, the main polling station where security forces vote was crowded. No terrorist can make his way in here. It is in the government quarter close to the Green Zone, separated by concrete walls from the rest of the world. Since 2003, when the Baghdad municipality was destroyed by heavy bombardment, there have been only two ways to get around here: you either walk or you drive a tank. </p><p> For some reason, you are not allowed to take pictures of the graphic scars left by the US bombardment. In fact, the entire system of bans in Iraq is highly contradictory. The current authorities seem to have inherited the disposition for paradoxical prohibitions from the Saddam era. For example, many people would tell you that it was perfectly fine to go for a walk in this area and take any pictures you like. </p><p> Military officers did not look particularly alert or shocked by the deaths of their colleagues. Possibly, it is just not that easy to shock people in Iraq after all they have been through. Under US occupation, 180,000 Iraqis were killed, 150,000 were widowed, 120,000 were orphaned. Even the most pro-American Iraqis think that the lists kept by activists at <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/" target="_blank">database</a> are accurate. In fact, everybody who trusts this organization and uses their figures would tell you that the death toll is actually ten times higher – and this is really scary. </p><p> </p><p> Notepads, cameras and chargers are the things that interest security personnel the most in a journalist’s bag. When I turned my spare battery on and a blue LED light began to blink, a fully veiled female guard searching me ran out of the tent to get the senior officer. When we explained to her that it was only a battery, she immediately stopped hollering and began to apologize with as much zeal. </p><p> Soldiers and officers from different units and in different uniforms kept coming in small groups, taking pictures of each other, taking pictures with me and asking for my Facebook account in order to become Facebook friends with me and post the photo. </p><p> At every checkpoint, they <em>“check”</em> your papers. My green international ID card worked fine in every instance. When I went into the polling station, they wrote down my name in a thick register and gladly demonstrated the voting procedure to me. </p><p> The polling station is set up in a school building. There were long lines to each of the classrooms, and senior officers waited in them just like ordinary soldiers. There was no segregation; on the contrary, there was an atmosphere of camaraderie. After voting, each platoon would take a group picture showing their inky index fingers. </p><p> Contrary to expectations, not all the military voted for the ruling bloc. They were more than willing to explain why they voted for the candidates they voted for. </p><p> What was even more contrary to the view dominating the media is that there were Sunnis among the military who voted for the bloc of the Shiite leader al-Sadr. </p><p> Rayad is not just a Sunni; he is a Sunni from Fallujah, which is currently seized by terrorist groups – al Qaeda and ISIS, Iraqis say. Rayad is the only Sunni in his unit, and he has Shiites under his command. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“The reason I vote for Sadr is not just because he is a good man. He protects everybody regardless of which group they belong to,”</em> Rayad tells me. Most of the people in his police squad vote for al-Sadr, not for al-Maliki’s ruling Shiite bloc. </p><p> The bloc of Muqtada al-Sadr who started a Shiite rebellion against US occupation in Najaf in 2004 runs against the ruling bloc of al-Maliki. It has 40 seats in the parliament and 6 ministerial positions in the government. </p><p> Rayad tells me about his hometown, Fallujah, which is famous for rebelling twice against US occupation in 2004. Now it has been seized by the radicals fighting <em>“infidels,”</em> as they refer to Shiites. </p><p> <em>“Those terrorist groups started their raids seven months ago. They use hit-and-run tactics. There are people from all over the world among them – Syria, Turkey, even Tunisia. I’ve never seen them myself but I know people who have. They quickly move around the city, and they have plenty of weapons. Most residents, including my family, have moved to Baghdad. They just left one man from each family to take care of their houses but it is impossible for the families to remain there,”</em> Rayad says. </p><p> Golsham Kamal Ali, the head of the PR department of the Independent High Electoral Commission, says that the terrorists attacked five polling stations where the servicemen voted. Other than that, she believes, the voting has begun well, and the servicemen are prepared for these attacks in any case. </p><p> A police unit wearing a different kind of uniform walks into the school yard. They have all voted for al-Maliki. <em>“I think he’s the right person for the job, he deserves it. He always acts sensibly, and I respect him”</em>, one of the policemen readily explains. </p><p> </p><p> His fellow policemen are all from Baghdad. They all say their families voted for al-Maliki as well. One of the policemen protests and says he voted for al-Sadr. Many Iraqis are particularly enthusiastic about the elections, because no one makes them cast their votes and they can vote against the ruling regime. They don’t really think about what they’ll get from that. </p><p> <em>“We may be certain that al-Maliki wins and stays in office. He suits both Americans and Iraqis, and these are the two groups that determine everything in Iraq now”</em>. This sentiment has now been repeated by everyone who’s so enthusiastic about the election process that they aren’t even hoping for any kind of change. </p><p> On Tuesday morning a curfew was imposed in some of the Bagdad districts, and access to the city will be restricted before the main voting day on April, 30. </p><p> This is the first post-occupation election in Iraq. There are about 9,000 candidates, one quarter of them women, running for 325 seats in the Parliament. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155868-europe-exports-china-military/</guid><title><![CDATA[EU states strike lucrative military contracts with China overriding embargo - report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155868-europe-exports-china-military/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0d/c0/00/europe-exports-china-military.jpg" title="Helicopters fly past the Chinese Jiangwei II class naval frigate &quot;Luoyang&quot; (Reuters/Guang Niu)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 14:14:26 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0d/c0/00/europe-exports-china-military.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Europe is powering the military rise of China, approving multi-million dollar deals for the transfer of weapons and dual-use technology – despite an arms embargo stemming from the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, AFP reveals.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0d/c0/00/europe-exports-china-military.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Helicopters fly past the Chinese Jiangwei II class naval frigate "Luoyang" (Reuters/Guang Niu)" /> <p> China is the world’s second largest military spender and the fastest growing military market, with Beijing setting aside $132 billion in defense spending. While they are yet to touch the US’ massive $495.6 billion defense budget, China recently announced they would increase military spending by 12.2 percent for 2014. </p><p> <em>“It will take China a long, long time before its budgets will effectively alter the military balance with the US,”</em> Jonathan Holslag of the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China Studies, recently told Stars and Stripes. </p><p> <em>“But that’s not the main concern. While the US still has some scope to respond, neighbors are getting much more nervous… Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines all know that they could be the first victim if the balance of power shifts at America’s detriment.”</em> </p><p> Although Western partners in the East are skittish about China’s rise, Europe seemingly cannot resist the allure of Beijing’s billions. </p><p> </p><p> French designed helicopters bolstering China’s air force, British jet engines driving fighter bombers and anti-ship strike aircraft, German and French engines providing the rudder to the Chinese navy – the role European exports play in China’s military is undeniable. </p><p> <em>“Without European technology, the Chinese navy would not be able to move,"</em> Andrei Chang, editor of the Hong Kong-based Kanwa Asian Defense Review, told AFP. </p><p> EU weapons manufactures received licenses to export equipment worth three billion euros ($4.1 billion) to China in the decade to 2012, annual EU reports on trade reveal. </p><p> The most recent document said arms exports totaling 173 million euros were given the green light in 2012, 80 percent of which were issued by France. A French parliamentary report said the country delivered arms to China worth 104 million euros. </p><blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> The PLA consists of four main service branches: the Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps. The total PLA forces hovers at just under 2.3 million. Currently, the Chinese nuclear stockpile is estimated at between 50 and 75 land and sea based ICBM's. The country is believed to have approximately 9,150 tanks. They also are in possession of an estimated 4,788 armored fighting vehicles and 1,770 multiple-launch rocket systems. The country’s air power consists of 2,788 aircraft, including 1,170 fighters, 885 fixed-wing attack aircraft, and 856 helicopters. China has 76 Sukhoi Su-27 air superiority fighters, another 73 Sukhoi Su-30MKK multirole fighters, and 165 domestically manufactured Shenyang J-11 air fighters. China also boasts 1 aircraft carrier, a 520 vessel strong navy including 45 frigates, 24 destroyers, 9 corvettes, and 69 submarines. </p> </blockquote><p> <em>“Already, cynics claim that if the People’s Liberation Army went to war tomorrow, it would employ an arsenal filled with equipment from Germany, France and Britain,"</em> Emil Kirchner, an EU policy expert at Britain's University of Essex, told said. </p><h2> Are exports legal with embargo in place? </h2><p> The European Union imposed an arms embargo on China following the killing of hundreds, if not thousands of protesters during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Analysts, however, say EU states have free will to interpret the embargo as they choose, a reality which has generated tension with the United States. </p><p> An EU spokesman said in a statement that <em>"the final decision to authorize or deny the (arms) export is the responsibility of EU member states."</em> </p><p> The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which monitors arms transfers, estimates that France, Britain and Germany account for 18 percent of Chinese military imports. Russia still provides the bulk of military hardware exports to China. </p><p> At the heart of China’s military modernization is its powerful new submarine fleet, which relies on state-of-the-art diesel engines designed by MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH of Friedrichshafen, Germany. </p><p> For Western states, these exports can impact the security of their allies. In January 2013, tensions nearly boiled over after a Jiangwei-class Chinese frigate locked fire-control radar on a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense destroyer and a helicopter near the disputed Senkaku/ Diaoyu Islands. </p><p> Military experts believe the ship relies on diesel engines produced by German firm MTU, AFP reports. </p><p> Another Chinese ship, a Jiangkai-class vessel, uses engines made by SEMT Pielstick, a French diesel engine manufacturer owned by German firm MAN Diesel and Turbo, according to analysts and specifications posted on Chinese military websites. </p><p> </p><p> MAN told AFP that its Chinese licensees have supplied about 250 engines to China's navy. MTU said it <em>"acts strictly according to the German export laws,</em>" without elaborating. </p><p> Meanwhile, in March Airbus Helicopters and China’s Avicopter – the helicopter business unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) – penned a joint agreement for the production of 1,000 new generation EC175/AC352 rotorcraft at the Elysée Palace in Paris. Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Francois Hollande were present for the signing. </p><p> Citing the co-production deal signed in France, Chang said: <em>"China uses the name of civil purchase to purchase French helicopter engines, and they shift those engines into military helicopters.</em> </p><p> <em>If (China) knows how to design the middle-sized EC175, they will know how to design a middle-sized military transport helicopter.”</em> </p><p> Meanwhile, the Netherlands is also behind 18 million euros' worth of "vessels of war" or their accessories and components, while the acquisition of a British-made Airborne Early Warning (AEW) platform for the latest Chinese surveillance aircraft has provided a boost to the People’s Liberation Army Air Force. </p><p> The Chinese defense ministry has previously said reports of the People’s Liberation Army dependence on foreign arms technology are exaggerated. <em>"According to international practice, China is also engaged in communication and cooperation with some countries in the area of weaponry development,"</em> the ministry said in a statement responding to this series. <em>"Some people have politicized China's normal commercial cooperation with foreign countries, smearing our reputation."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155904-ukraine-economy-crisis-q1/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pain for Ukraine: Economy loses 1.1 percent in Q1]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155904-ukraine-economy-crisis-q1/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/00/00/2ukraine-economy-crisis-q1.jpg" title="Reuters/Gleb Garanich"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:52:15 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/10/00/00/2ukraine-economy-crisis-q1.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine’s economy contracted 1.1 percent in the first three months of 2014, Ukraine’s Statistical Service reported Wednesday. This poor performance puts the economy on track to slow 4 percent overall in 2014.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/00/00/2ukraine-economy-crisis-q1.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Gleb Garanich" /> <p> The preliminary estimate compares to a 1.2 percent drop in the same 3-month period in 2013, and a 2 percent GDP fall in the fourth quarter, data also provided by Ukraine's <a href="http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/Noviny/new2014/zmist/21_u.htm" target="_blank">Statistics Office</a>. There was zero growth in 2013, and the IMF has forecast a 4 percent contraction in 2014. </p><p> The past few months have been tumultuous times for Ukraine, which has been the epicenter of violent protests that reveal the deep political divide between the West and East. In February, a provisional government took control of Kiev in the course of events viewed as a coup in Russia. Presidential elections will be held May 25. </p><p> But Ukraine’s economy had been headed towards default long before Maidan protests began in November 2013 when then-President Viktor Yanukovich refused to sign a trade agreement with the European Union. </p><p> Gold and foreign exchange reserves are quickly depleting, and currently stand at $12 billion. In February, before the coup-appointed government took power, reserves had reached a critical level of $18 billion. In 2013, more than $4 billion in international reserves were wiped out. </p><p> Reserves are nearly gone because Ukraine’s Central Bank has spent billions on currency intervention to prop up the sinking hryvnia, which has depreciated 28 percent against the dollar this year. </p><p> The sliding hryvnia is also adding pressure on government solvency, as over a half of Ukraine’s debt is denominated in foreign currency. </p><p> Inflation is expected to continue to rise, with the IMF predicting 12 percent in 2014. </p><p> The Ukrainian Central Bank is also tapping into the country’s reserves to pay off the country’s fast-accumulating debt. </p><p> Finance Minister Vitaliy Lisovenko said the government has $9 billion in foreign-currency debt payments this year. </p><p> The country owes at least <a href="http://rt.com/business/gas-war-ukraine-russia-845/" target="_blank">$2.2 billion</a> to Russia’s Gazprom, but says this obligation will not be a priority. State-owned Naftogaz is on the brink of bankruptcy, because it has been selling gas domestically for only a fraction of the import price. </p><p> A Eurobond sale could help stabilize the financial situation, Deputy Finance Minister Vitaliy Lisovenko said Friday April 25. The Eurobond sale would be under a US guarantee. </p><h2> ‘Help’ on the way </h2><p> Ukraine is waiting for a final loan figure from the International Monetary Fund, a package expected to be upwards of <a href="http://rt.com/business/imf-ukraine-financial-help-105/" target="_blank">$18 billion</a>. Details on the package are expected to be announced today. The first tranche will come in May. </p><p> An additional $750 million from the World Bank, 600 million euro from the European Union, and $100 million from Japan in aid will make its way to Kiev. The US has also promised <a href="http://rt.com/business/congress-approves-aid-ukraine-881/" target="_blank">$1 billion</a> in loan guarantees to help the collapsing Ukraine economy. However, so far these are just promises and no physical funds have been transferred to torn apart Ukraine. </p><p> <em>"Of course we need a fully fledged agreement with the IMF but the European Union is ready for macro-financial aid in the framework of the overall package. So we are ready to support Ukraine,"</em> European Council President Herman Van Rompuy told reporters Wednesday. </p><p> In December, Russia provided Ukraine with a <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-15-billion-gas-381/" target="_blank">$15 billion</a> ‘no-strings-attached’ loan, but so far, the West hasn’t delivered on any of its promises to help Ukraine. </p><p> Under the terms of the Russia-Ukraine deal signed in December, Ukraine's debt shouldn’t exceed 60 percent of GDP. This means that technically Russia has the right to demand the money back before the bonds are due in 2015. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155916-america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[US-Russia relations need a return to reason]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155916-america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/c0/00/america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Reuters)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:44:34 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/c0/00/america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The second wave of US sanctions against Russian officials and the heated rhetoric exchange between the leaders of both countries, with each side blaming the other, show without a doubt that US-Russia relations have bottomed out.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/c0/00/america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Reuters)" /> <p> It is time to abandon political posturing and introduce some rationality to the discussion. The stakes are too high to allow this confrontation between Washington and Moscow to continue, as the consequences are unpredictable. </p><p> The violent chaos spreading in Ukraine has the potential to spark a much wider conflict in Europe on a scale not seen since 1945. The expansion of NATO military hardware and personnel along Russia's borders and the threats of further devastating Western sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy are pushing us towards a nightmare scenario that neither the US nor its European allies are prepared to face. </p><p> A certain modicum of cynicism and hypocrisy is perhaps unavoidable in foreign policy, but choosing to overlook any of the interim Kiev government's wrongdoings, and blaming every instance of violence on Russian provocateurs exceeds these limits – or, to borrow from US President Barack Obama's parlance, crosses every red line. </p><p> It is true that some opposing views occasionally penetrate the Western media's wall of anti-Russian consensus, but their numbers are as few as those of Soviet-era dissidents in a KGB-dominated state. </p><p> The recent Geneva agreement was a step in the right direction, but it has not changed the untenable situation on the ground. The real question now is who is going to put it into effect? </p><p> For example, Kiev has not followed through on its promise to disarm illegally armed militant groups – such as the nationalist Right Sector paramilitary group – which was one of the vital points of the Geneva deal. Nor does it show any inclination that it will do so any time soon. </p><p> The greatest danger here is that Ukraine is edging closer and closer toward a full-scale civil war by the day. But there is an even greater danger of the conflict escalating into a direct military confrontation between US-led NATO forces and Russia, a scenario with the most horrific consequences for both sides. </p><p> A NATO intervention in Ukraine, followed by a reciprocal move by Russia, is not a desirable outcome. Therefore, as tensions rise and the conditions in Ukraine continue to deteriorate, policymakers in Washington and Moscow need to recognize the extremely urgent need to find a means of extricating themselves from this crisis. This should be done before it transforms from a regional crisis to a full-blown international conflagration. </p><p> During a recent interview, President Vladimir Putin offered Washington an opportunity to break this futile cycle of mutual accusation and ineffectual posturing. <em>"I think there is nothing that would hinder normalization and normal cooperation with the West. This does not depend on us, or rather not only on us. This depends on our partners,"</em> said Putin. In the same interview he welcomed the appointment of former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg as the next NATO secretary-general. </p><p> Regardless of your opinion of Putin, since first taking office 15 years ago he has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness and ability to constructively cooperate with the US on major issues. Even today, crucial US air supplies to the NATO-backed security forces in Afghanistan are made easier by Russia, which provides secure access via its Northern Air Corridor. Both nations share the same security concerns with regard to the spread of nuclear weapons and terror threats from radical Islamists. </p><p> To be sure, it is Washington that holds practically all the keys to a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. Not only has it helped to install the present government but, judging from the incessant visits of senior US officials to Kiev, it is they who are calling the shots. </p><p> Kiev's actions, paired with Washington's threat of additional sanctions and failure to push for a compromise by implementing the Geneva agreement, raise the fears that we are quickly moving toward a situation that both sides might end up deeply regretting. </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Edward Lozansky and Martin Sieff for RT</span></em> </p><p> <span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);"><em>Edward Lozansky is President of the American University in Moscow</em></span> </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Martin Sieff is a Senior Fellow of the American University in Moscow</span></em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155784-twitter-posts-132m-loss/</guid><title><![CDATA[Twitter’s $132bn Q1 loss sends shares tumbling more than 11%]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155784-twitter-posts-132m-loss/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/08/80/00/twitter-postsm-loss.jpg" title="Reuters/Brendan McDermid"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:43:54 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/08/80/00/twitter-postsm-loss.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Shares in the social network Twitter have fallen 11.1 percent on market opening in New York on Wednesday after the company announced disappointing first quarter results.

He also underlined the fact that those actions are accompanied by provocative statements by NATO’s Secretary General about the need to withhold Russia,”</em> the statement from the Defense Ministry said. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155912-us-sanctions-against-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Sanctions: The sanctimonious solution]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155912-us-sanctions-against-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/80/00/us-sanctions-against-russia.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama (Reuters/Larry Downing)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:05:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/80/00/us-sanctions-against-russia.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />As Moscow withdrew its troops from the border with Ukraine, President Obama announced further sanctions against Russian politicians and businessmen to a chorus of economists gleefully predicting the havoc to be wrought on the Russian economy.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/80/00/us-sanctions-against-russia.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama (Reuters/Larry Downing)" /> <p> Of course, there’s not much evidence that sanctions have every actually achieved anything beyond making life difficult for lesser or greater numbers of people. Furthermore, the entire idea runs counter to the creed of global market liberalization so openly embraced by the very people who support slapping sanctions on anyone who indicates that they may not be in complete accord with them on each and every topic under the sun. </p><p> The World Trade Organization (WTO), for example, was supposed to prevent nations from using their economies as a tool in the service of their own political interests. This has long served as the rationale for the WTO’s limited consideration of social rights or the environment when rendering its decisions. </p><p> In the world of international law, sanctions are therefore a bit passé, really. They may have sounded like a good idea 20 years ago, but we’ve all moved on since then. </p><p> Thus, the idea that the USA and Europe are somehow going to bludgeon Russia into submission using a tool that much-more-vulnerable Cuba has blithely held out against for over half a century, is at first glance, worth a laugh. After all, it’s an open secret that the only country the US has managed to isolate with its sanctions has long been itself. In fact, before Gaddafi was ousted in 2011, the United States was – thanks to the long-standing Pan-Am controversy – virtually the only country that wasn’t getting oil concessions out of Libya. </p><p> Much has been said about the overweening arrogance sanctioning Russia displays Max Keiser’s <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/155120-living-behind-cnn-curtain/" target="_blank">article</a> earlier this week was particularly interesting, especially since it hasn’t been possible to portray these sanctions as the usual punishment for not having a <em>‘democratic’</em> government. Are Western leaders really so out of touch that they think Russia will give in because it is being sanctioned by the US and Europe? </p><p> I doubt it. </p><p> There’s a deeper game here and it is as follows: 1) sanctioning Russia makes it look like Western leaders are actually doing something (thereby satisfying public opinion at home); 2) if I were a betting woman, I would put money on it coming out someday that these sanctions were laid down in a manner curiously advantageous to certain Western businesses; 3) as far as Western leaders are concerned it isn’t Russia that is the problem, it’s Putin. I think they’ve gotten the message that Putin is not the <em>‘caving in’</em> type. So rather than get him to back down, they’d probably rather just get rid of him. Hence the litany of complaints personally directed against Putin over the past several months. </p><p> It might surprise many Russians to learn that a large segment of the North American population believes that Vladimir Putin is an unelected dictator and that they are paranoid of being put under surveillance by him. I understand that you may need to read that twice to take it all in. Most people react to my telling them that I write for RT as if I have just announced that I have a license to kill. </p><p> But difficult as it is, try to see things from the point of view of your average Western power-broker. They can remember the good old times, when Yeltsin was in charge (using that term loosely) and Russia was an investment bonanza, a real <em>“free market”</em>, plentiful in crony capitalism with minimal social security and all the natural resources you can take. </p><p> They would like that back. </p><p> And after that, they would like a similar arrangement in China, please. </p><p> Once that is accomplished everyone will finally be on the same wavelength and the world will be remarkably conflict-free. It wouldn’t matter so much where Ukraine chose to make its political and economic alliances, because under this scenario the money would all be flowing into the same pockets, anyway and at a rate rapid enough to keep everyone satisfied. </p><p> </p><p> And Western leaders think that they have a certain chance of getting Part 1 of their policy taken care of, because they are hoping that if they can cause the Russian economy to tank, it will eventually, when the dust has settled, hit Putin’s popularity so hard as to hurt his chances of re-election. This is a basic tactic that is used a lot in international negotiations. It’s played by getting anyone you think is a tough negotiator removed from their job by spreading misinformation about them back to their home government or simply outright demanding that the home government sack them in order for negotiations to proceed at all. </p><p> You can see both of these tactics at play in regards to Putin at the moment. I’m all for a healthy dose of criticism in domestic politics, but Russia as spy state using covert operations to topple governments while simultaneously placing us all under surveillance sounds a lot like Western leaders just cobbled together everyone’s complaints about them and hurled them at the new/old arch-enemy. Classic misinformation. </p><p> Sanctions are an example of tactic two: I don’t like you so I’m not going to deal with you. If your country wants to talk to me they have to send someone with a better attitude, which means someone who thinks that the word ‘negotiation’ means that we do whatever I want. People sometimes wonder at the high proportion of idiots given government posts. Now you know. If you have a backbone, your survival chances decrease dramatically, because you get hit-listed. </p><p> Consider further that this kind of aggressive action is necessary for Western leaders, because their backs are already against the wall. Their own constituents are fed-up to levels that haven’t been seen since the 1960s, with inequality growing daily. The largest political parties have already decided that they are in the game for themselves, with few differences to speak of between their policies. Thus, they only have two choices – continue going with whatever policies suit their wealthy campaign backers or do an about-face and start compromising with <em>‘the people’</em>. </p><p> Needless to say, that would burn the bridge with campaign financiers, and since that relationship has been ongoing for a very long time, taking the plunge to change things around seems like a pretty big risk. So no one does it, and they just continue doing what they’ve done for the last 20 years, which is to try to steamroll everything in their path. </p><p> This is the real logic behind sanctions: an attempt to make the Russian leadership unpopular with its own businesses and citizens to the point that a more conciliatory party and leader are elected. No easy task, clearly, since imposing sanctions which exclusively hit Russia involves a fair bit of cherry-picking. </p><p> Western politicians seem determined to follow this course to the bitter end rather than acknowledge that their own political interests may not be the only ones on Earth or that we might be under some sort of obligation to negotiate with the elected leaders of other nations. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155908-ukraine-drills-kiev-military/</guid><title><![CDATA[State Guard, police hold night drill in Kiev (VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155908-ukraine-drills-kiev-military/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/40/00/ukraine-drills-kiev-military-.jpg" title="Ukrainian special troops of the national guard and the presidential regiment patrol during military exercises in the centre of Kiev early on May 1, 2014 (AFP Photo / Anatoly Stepanov)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 12:20:18 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://img.rt.com/files/news/26/10/40/00/ukraine-drills-kiev-military-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine’s State Guard and police units held a civil protection drill in Kiev on Wednesday night, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/40/00/ukraine-drills-kiev-military-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Ukrainian special troops of the national guard and the presidential regiment patrol during military exercises in the centre of Kiev early on May 1, 2014 (AFP Photo / Anatoly Stepanov)" /> <p> A <a href="http://kievcity.gov.ua/news/14504.html" target="_blank">short statement</a> was published on Kiev City Hall’s website early on Wednesday, warning <em>“residents and guests of the capital”</em> of a special tactical drill to <em>“be held in Kiev on the night of April 30 to May 1.”</em> <br><br> The announcement attracted huge attention from both the media and Kiev residents, as it promised <em>“columns of combat vehicles”</em> moving through the city during the exercise. <br><br> However, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry hurried to refute the claims by the mayor’s office, stating that the country's armed forces were not planning to hold any military drills in the capital. <br><em><br> “The announcement of a special tactical exercise, which was posted today – April 30 – on the official website of the Kiev city administration has nothing to do with the activities of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,”</em> a <a href="http://www.mil.gov.ua/index.php?lang=ua&amp;part=news&amp;sub=read&amp;id=34288" target="_blank">statement</a> on the Defense Ministry’s website said. <br><em><br> “The personnel and military vehicles of the city’s garrison remain at the place of their permanent location. Their deployment in the city’s center is not expected,”</em> the statement added. <br><br> Later on Wednesday, Kiev's Mayor Vladimir Bondareko appeared on Ukrainian television to clarify the situation. <br><br> He stated that only troops from the State Guard and Interior Ministry – not the army – would be taking part in the night drill. <br><br><em>"Today we are working with units...which must protect the population in case of certain events. So, today we’ll try to train the movement of these units. They will arrive in of Pechersk district (a historical neighborhood in central Kiev), where the government institutions are situated, and then return to their bases,”</em> Bondareko said. <br><br> The mayor explained that the exercises are vital due to the events taking place in southeastern Ukraine. Protests against the coup-imposed Ukrainian government are on the rise in the region, with anti-Kiev activists seizing administrative buildings and demanding a referendum on federalization. <br><br> "<em>We must be ready for everything, and Kiev’s city administration is doing all it can that if, God forbid, something happens, we’ll be able to hide in shelters and get water; so that we knew where to go for medical aid</em>,” he stressed. </p><p> Earlier Ukraine’s coup-appointed President Aleksandr Turchinov announced that the army is now in a state of high alert due to the "<em>real threat</em>" of a Russian military invasion. </p><p> At the same time he admitted that Kiev cannot control the situation in the east of Ukraine, where anti-government protesters are continuing to take over government buildings. </p><p> The clashes on Tuesday night happened between an ultra-nationalist Social-National Assembly, a faction of the Right Sector militant group and members of the Maidan self-defense militia, as the nationalists were holding a torch rally through central Kiev. </p><p> Many Ukrainian nationalists are appalled by the Ukrainian government’s failure to crackdown on the eastern Ukrainian protest. Some even call for another change at the top. </p><p> Some Ukrainian officials branded the torch rally as a provocation inspired by Russia, although no explanation was given as to how Russia could have any influence on that group. </p><p> Ukraine’s central authorities previously tried to use the military against the protesters in the east, but this proved to be inefficient. The morale of the troops is low, and there were cases of some soldiers defecting to the protesters instead of fighting against them. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155884-juice-news-israel-palestine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Juice News: Mid-East Peace malady (ft.

(AFP Photo)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What do you make of Kerry's taking back his comments on the apartheid character of Israel and what does it say about the US commitment to the peace process and two-state solution?</em> </p><p> <strong>Nabil Shaath:</strong> I think the US is committed to a two-state solution and it remains committed to some peace process, but they realize that it is very difficult to get anything done with the present Israeli government. The last 9 month were frustrating - the Israeli government today does not believe in any of the international commitments that it made before in the Oslo agreement, in the road map, in Napoli and many other places, starting in Madrid in 1991. Therefore it is very difficult really to reach the two-states solution when Israelis are eating up the occupied territory in the West Bank and they are really treating us [Palestinians] like the [black] South Africans were treated during the apartheid system. It is very difficult really to have a peace process. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong><em>What about US diplomacy that can’t be honest with its partner in trying to find a solution?</em> </p><p> <strong>NS:</strong> The US Secretary of State has his commitments and has his diplomatic language. Once in a while I think it becomes very frustrating, so he expresses the truth and then finds it very difficult to swallow. This is not the first time that it’s happened… if you recall in 1991 at the Madrid conference, President Bush, and Foreign Secretary James Baker took a harsh position against Mr. Shamir and in fact withdrew $10 billion of loan guarantees that the US committed to give to Israel in order to get Israel to move on the peace process and to go to the Madrid conference. I think it’s the responsibility of the US to do so… not only to put pressure on the Palestinians. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>A deal was struck recently among rival factions, Hamas and Fatah. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group. How can the peace process go forward with Hamas unwilling to recognize Israel?</em> </p><p> <strong>NS:</strong> It’s very ironic that Mr Netanyahu said this, while he has in his cabinet people like Naftali Bennett and others who totally negate the peace process, totally negate any commitment to the process and who very clearly declare their extreme positions on never accepting a Palestinian state. If you really look at the way the Israeli army has been dealing with our people and the settlers have been dealing with our people, during these negotiations 60 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli army or settlers. If Mr Netanyahu wants peace he has to accept the Palestinian people together, in one package, in one state. He has no the right to divide Palestinians. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>But if you struck a deal between Hamas and Fatah, then any sort of peace process will be delayed because of Israel’s reaction. Couldn’t those factions have postponed joining together?</em> </p><p> <strong>NS:</strong> No, we have to unite our people because the Israelis have been telling us we cannot negotiate with you if you do not represent Gaza, if you represent only the West Bank we cannot have peace with all the Palestinians. And now they say the contrary: <em>“If you have Gaza and the West Bank together, we don’t want peace with you.”</em> The unity we are seeking with Hamas is a democratic unity that will be based on elections and the Palestinian people will decide, and there are commitments that we have made that we will keep and there is the constitution of the PNA [Palestinian National Authority] that has made peace with Israelis that will be kept. But it’s the Palestinian people who will decide that in the elections. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155896-kerry-blames-eu-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Kerry rebuked EU for inciting Ukraine ‘tug of war’– report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155896-kerry-blames-eu-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/80/00/kerry-blames-eu-ukraine.jpg" title="Anti-government protesters detain a policeman (2nd L) during clashes in the Independence Square in Kiev February 20, 2014.

(Reuters/Yannis Behrakis)" /> <p> <em>“Some folks in Europe made mistakes, the association agreement became too much of an East-West tug of war. It shouldn’t have been,”</em> US Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly said at a private meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Washington last Friday. His words were quoted by the Daily Beast on Tuesday. </p><p> Russia has long insisted that the EU and the US sparked the political crisis in Ukraine last October. The EU Association Agreement, which President Viktor Yanukovich refused to sign after long deliberation, would require Ukraine to sever or downgrade many of its economic ties with Russia, which would hurt greatly its economy. Yanukovich’s decision triggered the protest in Kiev, which eventually escalated into an armed coup that deposed him. </p><p> European and American officials rejected Russia’s view of the ill-fated agreement, insisting it would not damage Ukraine’s trade with Russia. But apparently in private conversation American diplomats don’t follow the narrative. </p><p> The division between the US and the EU over Ukraine was highlighted earlier in February after a recording of a phone conversation between Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and American Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt <a href="http://rt.com/news/nuland-phone-chat-ukraine-927/" target="_blank">was leaked</a>. </p><p> They were discussing the foreign effort to help anti-Yanukovich opposition create what has now became the new Ukrainian government and expressed frustration at EU’s hesitance on the matter, culminated by the infamous “F**k the EU” exclamation from Nuland. </p><p> </p><p> Kerry’s private comment on the EU’s role in the crisis is just a small part of the Daily Beast report. The majority was focused on the alleged evidence that the US had of Russian agents acting in Ukraine to stir up protest. While the website initially implied that the evidence had been recorded by US intelligence, the State Department later clarified that the reported remarks were related to recordings produced by the Ukrainian government. </p><p> Kiev published a six-minute recording, which it said proved the presence of Russian secret agents in Ukraine, two weeks ago. This was one day after a disastrous attack on protester-held Slavyansk, in which then-head of the Anti-Terrorist Center of the Ukrainian Security Service was injured. However, the evidence was far from conclusively damning for Russia. </p><p> Another package of evidence Ukraine produced so far, which the US State Department endorsed, proved to be faulty. The alleged photo evidence case quickly collapsed, with the New York Times, which headlined it, having to publish a follow-up <a href="http://rt.com/news/154548-pictures-russian-troops-false/" target="_blank">admitting</a> its failure to properly verify it. </p><p> Following Kerry’s previous remarks on the alleged Russian involvement in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov <a href="http://rt.com/news/154832-russian-agents-ukraine-lavrov/" target="_blank">challenged</a> his counterpart to produce any real proof. </p><p> <em>“Kerry has many times mentioned that Ukrainian intelligence captured Russian agents,”</em> he said. <em>“So, show them to the people, have them on TV. Kerry says they don’t want to disclose the identities of those people who are engaged in the captures. This is not serious.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155832-elections-in-iraq-security-sectarianism/</guid><title><![CDATA[Iraq election could bring Sunni and Shia reconciliation]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155832-elections-in-iraq-security-sectarianism/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0b/80/00/elections-in-iraq-security-sectarianism.jpg" title="A fully-veiled woman shows her ink-stained finger at a polling station during voting for Iraqi parliamentary election in Baghdad April 30, 2014.

As a result, this political tension, even after the US intervention in 2003, has still found a way to permeate society and increase violence. The reason that the government is ineffective is because of long-term traditional problems within the sectarian communities and also because of US inability to bring political results after the post-2003 invasion. So a combination of the two – history and US intervention. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>You fought in the Iraq war. Do you think the invasion helped the country in any way, and what is your view on military interventions in general?</em> </p><div class="cont-wp advance-extra"> <blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> On April 30 Iraq is holding its first ever parliamentary elections since the withdrawal of US troops. However, the sectarian tensions in the country are extremely high, while Iraq itself is a fragmented state, and these facts do affect the ongoing voting. Though security level was increased significantly, the two days before elections were shaded by a wave of deadly attacks. </p> </blockquote> </div><p> <strong>JD:</strong> It’s funny to look at the modern security environment that Iraq faces, and Syria and Lebanon face…. it’s increasingly apparent that third party interventions are not working out for the benefit of Iraqis, Syrians, and Lebanese. These kinds of sectarian solutions need to come from within, they need to come from domestic political resolutions and they need to come from the international community, pushing this sort of thing through the UN and through the Security Council, but how it works in neo-imperial colonial style through coercion and force, it doesn’t seem to have worked so far very well in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria or other places. I don’t think that tradition is going to change in the very near future. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What impact has the civil war in Syria had on the security situation in Iraq?</em> </p><p> <strong>JD:</strong> Indeed. It’s interesting to see that the sectarian violence in Iraq bled over into Syria after the Bashar Al-Assad regime had its political squabbles. And as a result, Iraq has bled over Syria and rebels have increasingly gained the territory, and there is an increasingly porous border with Turkey that the Syrian civil war has then penetrated back into Iraq. Just to quote Muqtada al-Sadr, very famous Shia militant leader, he has said that Al-Qaeda, Al-Sham, and the Islamic State of the Levant are everywhere, in every corner of the street. Syria has bled over in Iraq, Iraq has bled over in Syria and the problem cannot be seen as an Iraqi problem or a Syrian problem. Now the problem of the Islamic State of the Levant and Islamic State of Al-Sham is a regional problem. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>A general election is coming up, what do you think the outcome will be?</em> </p><p> <strong>JD:</strong> The looming political elections going on in Iraq are going to bring two possible problems and two possible very good events. The first problem, that is the biggest problem, could be the increasingly sectarian tensions that would be further dividing society. The other problem is that Al-Qaeda could demonstrate itself as a power force by bombing election cycles, intimidating communities, and as a result, some groups may want to boycott the elections out of fear. This occurred in 2005 most prominently. The two good things to come, if in fact that it is a fair and relatively diplomatic election, you will see increasing cooperation between Sunni and Shia political leaders. The other positive thing that could occur is greater stability in the country. I definitely think that Al-Qaeda will make a stand, some people will be intimidated. So it’s likely that we are going to have some violence, it is likely there is going to be some corruption, but it is also likely that the political establishment in Iraq is going to try to stand for communities and not to be pressured by extremists. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
