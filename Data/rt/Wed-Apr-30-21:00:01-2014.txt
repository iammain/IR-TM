Nathan Deal signed a bill on Tuesday that requires drug testing for some welfare applicants – and makes them foot the bill as well.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Georgia Governor Nathan Deal (Reuters / Tami Chappell)" /> <p> According to local NBC affiliate WXIA, the new law will place the fate of a welfare/food stamp applicant in the hands of state employees, who will determine whether or not a drug test is necessary. Generally, this decision would be made by taking into account an individual’s police record, demeanor, reasons for termination from employment, and any missed appointments. </p><p> On Monday, the day before Deal signed the legislation into law, the governor described the challenges facing the proposal that ultimately won his signature. </p><p> <em>"You're trying to balance two competing forces,”</em> he told WXIA. <em>“First is the right of the individual if they qualify to be given assistance in terms of food stamps. On the other hand, the right of the taxpayer not to be putting money in the hands of those abusing drugs. So it's a delicate balance of social issues.”</em> </p><p> The bill has been dubbed <em>“the toughest in the nation when it comes to public assistance”</em> by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, but supporters claim that it ensures anyone receiving taxpayer money is doing so fairly. </p><p> <em>“We passed a bill that simply insists on some level of personal responsibility of people who receive public funds for their support and livelihood,”</em> said state Speaker of the House David Ralston (R). </p><p> Opponents, however, argue that since the state increasingly uses the internet and the phone to manage applications, officials don’t have the kind of in-person interaction necessary to validate claims of reasonable suspicion that require a drug test. </p><p> Additionally, the bill forces applicants to pay for their drug exam – regardless of whether or not they test positive for anything – and places what opponents see as yet another obstacle in the way of the state’s poorest residents. </p><p> <em>"It's a badly flawed bill,"</em> Debbie Seagraves of Georgia’s American Civil Liberties Union said to Reuters. <em>"It will be challenged.”</em> </p><p> <em>"It's one thing for a judge, or district attorney, or police officer to judge what's reasonable suspicion,”</em> added Sen. Vincent Ford (D) to WXIA. <em>“But giving it to an overworked bureaucrat? I think it is bottom line, unfair.”</em> </p><p> As noted by Reuters, other states have tried to implement like-minded bills only to see them fall by the wayside. Last year, a federal judge struck down a similar bill, ruling it violated applicants’ constitutional rights against unreasonable search. Meanwhile, the Republican governor of North Carolina vetoed a drug-testing bill in 2013, arguing it had generated no tangible benefits in other states. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155984-stop-search-police-uk/</guid><title><![CDATA[UK Home Secretary urges ‘illegal’ stop and search practice overhaul]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155984-stop-search-police-uk/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.jpg" title="Reuters/Andrew Winning"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 18:15:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK Home Secretary Theresa May has called for an overhaul of police stop and search powers, telling the House of Commons that as many as 250,000 illegal stop and searches may have been undertaken last year.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Andrew Winning" /> <p> May announced plans to change the law, suggesting a review of all stop and search training, and making officers undertake an assessment of their awareness of the practice rules. </p><p> She added that if the number of stop and searches taking place did not drop then she would start making calls for a change to the law. </p><p> <em>“Nobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police,”</em> May told MPs. </p><p> Black people are seven times more likely to be stopped by police than white people. Additionally, only 10 percent of searches actually result in arrest, according to a recent study by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. </p><p> Police are presently allowed to stop somebody only if there are reasonable grounds upon which to suspect that an individual is carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property, or something which could be used to commit a crime, e.g. a crowbar. </p><p> May demanded clarity on what constituted ‘reasonable grounds,’ as well as the opening of records for public scrutiny and <em>“unconscious bias awareness training”</em> to reduce the risk of discrimination. </p><p> As evidence of the necessity for a reform package, May cited the recent study by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. Its conclusions showed that with 27 percent of stop and search records examined, there were no reasonable grounds upon which to search people, despite a supervisor having given the green light for searches to take place. </p><p> <em>”If the HMIC sample is accurate, that means more than a quarter of the million or so stops carried out under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act last year could have been illegal,”</em> stated May. </p><p> The Labour Party said that May’s plans do not go far enough. </p><p> Her opposition counterpart, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper asked her: <em>“Why aren't you banning the use of targets given to police officers to stop and search a certain number of people?”</em> Cooper also questioned why the guidance on race discrimination didn’t have a statutory basis and why there was no insistence that all forces abide by case law instead of just “some.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155980-fidel-salinas-anonymous-indicted/</guid><title><![CDATA[FBI may put alleged Anonymous member behind bars for 440 years]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155980-fidel-salinas-anonymous-indicted/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/c0/00/fidel_salinas.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Raul Arboleda"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 17:19:30 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/14/c0/00/fidel_salinas.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A man accused of being a member of the amorphous hacktivist movement Anonymous now faces a total of 44 charges after federal investigators announced on Tuesday the filing of second superseding indictment against Fidel Salinas of Donna, Texas.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/c0/00/fidel_salinas.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Raul Arboleda" /> <p> Salinas, 27, was first charged last October with one count of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act after a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas said he intentionally tried to hack into the computer system of Hidalgo County practically two years earlier. A superseding indictment was unsealed earlier this month on April 2 and introduced 15 additional counts against Salinas, but this week the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that even more charges have since been brought. </p><p> The FBI <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/sanantonio/press-releases/2014/alleged-anonymous-computer-hacker-charged-with-18-counts-of-cyberstalking" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on Tuesday that Salinas now faces a total of 44 charges due to his supposed role in attempting to hack computer systems belonging to Hidalgo County, the La Joya Independent School District and The Monitor newspaper of McAllen, TX, as well as the computer of an unnamed female victim he is alleged to have cyber-stalked at least 18 times in December 2011. </p><p> Authorities say that Salinas conspired with members of the internationally-dispersed hacktivist collective Anonymous to coordinate these attacks, and spent at least six months conversing with others in a chat room affiliated with the group’s Operation Anti-Security, or Antisec, faction. </p><p> Salinas pleaded not guilty in October 2013 to the single-count indictment related to the Hidalgo County hack and was scheduled to stand trial in March, but proceedings were continuously put on hold until earlier this month when the first superseding indictment was unsealed on April 2 and he was further accused of 15 new counts involving the county computer system, the school district and The Monitor. Salinas again pleaded not guilty to all counts at an arraignment on April 10, but authorities have now confirmed that additional charges have been introduced in a second superseding indictment. </p><p> In Tuesday’s statement, the FBI said: <em>"Salinas faces up to 10 years in federal prison on each of the charges, upon conviction."</em> If correct, then prosecutors could seek upwards of 440 years. </p><p> The FBI's announcement was absent specific details about the latest charges, but those were made public on Wednesday afternoon when the newest indictment was uploaded to the PACER court records site. </p><p> <em>“According to the allegations, between Dec. 23-29, 2011, Salinas had the intent to harass and intimidate a female victim. Allegedly, he repeatedly e-mailed her, attempted to gain unauthorized access to her website, made submissions through a contact form on that site and tried to open user accounts without her consent,</em>” the FBI said in Tuesday’s statement. </p><p> <em>“The indictment lists his alleged attempts to stalk her and hack into her website. According to the indictment, he repeatedly did so late at night and early in the morning, with his stalking attempts or messages sometimes occurring less than one minute apart from each other. He allegedly did so as part of a conspiracy or agreement with at least one other person, according to the charges.”</em> </p><p> Earlier this month, legal counsel for Salinas told the Associated Press that prosecutors wouldn’t be able to persevere in court. </p><p> <em>“They can’t make a case against my client,”</em> attorney Alma Garza told the <a href="http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2014-04-10/south-texas-man-accused-hacking-attempts" target="_blank">AP</a>, adding that the case against Salinas has dragged on for two years. </p><p> Indeed, the trove of court documents that is accessible suggests that the authorities have been pursuing charges against Salinas for some time already. The first document in Salinas’ criminal docket is dated September 11, 2013 and consists of a criminal complaint filed by FBI Special Agent Truoung Nguyen containing allegations about alleged hacks from early 2012. </p><p> <iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/221201246/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="undefined" id="doc_16902" name="doc_16902" frameborder="0" height="600" scrolling="no" width="100%"></iframe> </p><p> According to Special Agent Nguyen, authorities narrowed in on their target that January after investigators linked an attempt to breach the site of Hidalgo County with a computer within a residence where Salinas was staying. Salinas <em>“made over 14,000 attempts to log into their website server,”</em> Nguyen charged, in turn slowing down the system for administrators and visitors alike and eventually requiring the county to hire tech specialists. In all, the hack is alleged to have cost Hidalgo County $10,620.32, according to the Sept. 2013 complaint. </p><p> Nguyen said the IP address of the computer used by Salinas was responsible for those thousands of attempted intrusions, and a search warrant executed a week after the hack occurred ended with the FBI seizing his laptops and recovering forensic evidence that linked him to the attacks. </p><p> Salinas was interviewed by FBI Special Agent Christopher Wallingsford several months later in September 2012 and admitted during that meeting and at a later one that he used a program on his computer to attempt to gain administrative access to the site, but that his efforts were to test the network’s security. </p><p> <em>“Salinas claimed that he was not trying to do anything illegal but thought that if he gained access [he] would passed on that information to the Hidalgo County Network Administrator as a courtesy,”</em> the complaint alleged. </p><p> Days after the Hidalgo breach landed him in handcuffs and the loss of his computers, Salinas authored an angry diatribe on his Facebook page believed to be directed at Hidalgo. </p><p> <em>“Fuck you corrupt officials and politicians,”</em> Salinas wrote. <em>“When someone tries to give you advice that your servers aren’t secure and said person doesn’t modify, access or download and ‘redistricted’ information. I believe you say thank you instead of being afraid of what you don’t know by getting an invalid warrant, arresting and wrongfully hijacking all his electronics.”</em> </p><p> Salinas, authorities say, ended the diatribe with a phrase commonly used within Anonymous: “<em>We do not forgive, we do not forget.”</em> </p><p> When the first superseding indictment was unveiled earlier this month, the FBI accused Salinas of 15 additional counts related to that hack and others, and introduced an overt fact to that charges: On or about June 6, 2011, Salinas entered the AntiSec chatroom affiliated with Anonymous. The hacktivist group’s name is otherwise absent from the indictment, except to note that Salinas joined a separate chatroom associated with the group six months later. </p><p> The FBI’s announcement this week did not blame Anonymous for the hacks per se, but instead acknowledged just that <em>“Salinas is allegedly linked to the computer-hacking group Anonymous.”</em> According to first superseding indictment, Salinas conducted a method of hack know as a SQL-injection against the targeted sites starting in November 2011. </p><p> With regards to the latest charged pertaining to alleged counts of cyber-stalking, authorities say Salinas did so with the aid of another party, but whether they believe those events were associated with Anonymous is not clear. The forensic examination of his computers seized in early 2012 reportedly contained logs from Anonymous-related chatrooms dating back to mid-2011, however, but reference to Salinas’ alleged role with AntiSec raises one other issue of note: authorities say Salinas began conversing with other AntiSec members on June 6, 2011 — hours before authorities arrested the Anonymous hacker responsible for that faction, Hector Xavier Monsegur, and recruited him as a federal informant. Monsegur is expected to be sentenced next week in New York City, but half-a-dozen hearings have previously been adjourned due to his ongoing cooperation with investigators. </p><p> The indictment made public on Wednesday now combines all charges against Salinas as found by the grand jury: counts one and two pertain to attempting to breach the county, school district and newspaper sites; count three alleges he conspired with others to use a computer “to cause emotional distress” to the female victim, identified only as “Y.V.”; count four involves an attempted hack of Y.V’s computer; counts five through 22 allege Salinas attempted to distress the victim multiple times over the internet on his own; 33 through 37 relate to the allege attempts to hack the woman’s computer; counts 38 through 43 pertain to attempting to hack the three other sites between November 2011 and January 2012 and count 44 accuses Salinas of attempting to recklessly cause damage to the Hidalgo County sight. </p><p> Counts one, two, four and 23 through 44 are all violations of the federal CFAA hacking law. Salinas is now scheduled to be arraigned on May 8 before Magistrate Judge Peter E. Ormsby. </p><p> <iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/221197449/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-a2zvhepxdcxdo17v7cp&amp;show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.772922022279349" id="doc_32174" name="doc_32174" frameborder="0" height="600" scrolling="no" width="100%"></iframe> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155968-us-economy-grow-snail/</guid><title><![CDATA[US economy grows at snail’s pace in first quarter, expands 0.1%]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155968-us-economy-grow-snail/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/00/00/us-economy-grow-snail.jpg" title="Reuters / Enrique Castro-Mendivil"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 17:05:41 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/14/00/00/us-economy-grow-snail.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The US economy came to a near standstill in the first quarter of 2014, growing at one of its weakest paces since 2012.

Exports fell at a rate of 7.6 percent in the first quarter – the biggest fall since the recession ended. The frigid weather could be to blame for less consumer spending, which only increased at a rate of 0.4 percent. <br><br> The slowdown is in stark contrast to the 3.4 percent economic expansion that the US enjoyed in the second half of 2013. <br><br> “We’ve been living in sub-3 percent land, and people have gotten used to that as the new normal. But it's not. It's anemic,” Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, told The New York Times. <br><br> America's economy slowed drastically in the first quarter of 2014, as wintry weather depressed corporate spending and housing sector activity. Smaller additions to inventories by farmers and businesses also held back growth. <br><br> Business spending dropped 2.1 percent between January and March, as companies spent less on buildings, equipment, and intellectual property. <br><br> Federal spending is set to grow in 2014, which could help offset the lackluster first quarter growth. Most economists are predicting an overall growth of between 2.5 and three percent. <br><br> Later on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will finish its two-day meeting and will likely announce another $10 billion in monthly bond purchases as part of its planned 'tapering’ of stimulus spending. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155992-iraq-elections-winner-corrupt/</guid><title><![CDATA[Iraqi elections: 'Most corrupted one will be the winner']]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155992-iraq-elections-winner-corrupt/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/15/80/00/iraq-elections-winner-corrupt.jpg" title="Photo by Nadezhda Kevorkova"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:39:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/15/80/00/iraq-elections-winner-corrupt.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The one who stole more Iraqi money is in a position to use the election and probably he will win, Muhavad Husam al Dine Al Bayati, Head of the Prime Minister office, told RT’s Nadezhda Kevorkova.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/15/80/00/iraq-elections-winner-corrupt.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo by Nadezhda Kevorkova" /> <p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>Who will be the winner in the parliamentary elections?</em> </p><p> <strong>Muhavad Husam al Dine Al Bayati</strong>: The most corrupted one will be the winner. I do not know who exactly will win. But I can judge that the one who stole more Iraqi money is in position to use the election and probably he will win. And the one who controls the army and the power will win. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>So if the block of the prime minister will win he will be such a person?</em> </p><blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> On April 30 Iraq is holding its first parliamentary elections since the withdrawal of US troops. Sectarian tension in the country is extremely high, while Iraq itself is a fragmented state, and it affects the ongoing voting. Though security was increased significantly, two days before the elections were overshadowed by a wave of deadly attacks. </p> </blockquote><p> <strong>MB</strong>: As you know the corruption in this country is very huge. And there is a lot of money in the hands of some politicians not necessary only from the block of prime minister. There are so many other blocks that stole so much money from the country. They can buy votes and support from IHEC [the Independent High Electoral Commission which approved the voting system and the counting method for 2014 parliamentary elections]. The results will not be very clear. </p><p> We do not have foreign observers or people who are watching the elections. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>People say that 65 American observers came to Iraq especially for the elections, is it so?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: What can these 65 do? Can they work on the street? Can they go to the governorates? Can they go to the election boxes and see how people vote and how their votes are counted? No, they cannot. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>What does it mean, this absence of interest to the first Iraqi elections? Does it mean that the US wants to change Iraqi authorities once more?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: We cannot be sure. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>What will happen after the elections? Will the tension and frequency of terroristic attacks start to grow or not?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: I think there will be a new government; there will be new leaders who will be able to start reconciliation in the country and forget about the past, forget about the revenge going on now in this country which we can’t stand. We need some leaders in the cabinet and in the Parliament who can start real reconciliation. Also there must be real reorganization of the army to contain all Iraqis but not only one sect as it is now. And also we need the reorganization that is related to the economy of the country, so that we can make our economy effective and promote other sectors apart from oil to provide income for the country. Then the economic situation will change. Now we are depending only on oil. And if other sectors do not participate in the economy, this country can collapse. Over 92% of the income of Iraq comes from oil. In 70-80s around 35% of its income came from agriculture. So we are a one-sided economy now. This should not continue. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>Why are people in Iraq saying that during the American presence the situation was better than now?</em> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: Because people are getting harder. They lost their homes. When people lose their homes they go to be extremists. You know they tried to talk to 6 governorates one year in a civilized and peaceful way, but they didn’t pay any attention to them. So they went to be extremists. They used their arms instead of acting in a peaceful way (the demolishing of Iraqi refugees camps in Anbar province in Dec 2013 – RT). This is complicating the situation. Plus there is no real balance in the government organization among the different sects. This made an impression on the Sunnis that they are oppressed and neglected. The distance between al Maliki and the Sunni community became too big. There is no communication and detention started from that. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>Iraqi Christians are running away from Iraq, nobody knows the percentage of Christians in the country now, but some experts think that it is less than a tenth of this community in the past, is it so and is it only one-way ticket for them?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: Even more Sunnis are leaving the country than Christians. I cannot see Iraq without Christians. Iraq was the best place for Christians in the region before the American war. They were treated as real Iraqis. Now because of the terrorist activity, security and neglect by the government they left their homes, but I am sure that when the security is improved all the Iraqis will come back including the Sunnis. I know how much they love Iraq, especially the Christians. Even the Jewish people that left the country – all people who remember the bread of Iraq they never can forget it and they want to come back to see the place where they were born. Now it is a sectarian government, but when it will be civilized government all people will come back. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>What is the role of Iran?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: Iran is one who brought this government in – Maliki’s government. It has huge influence. Their influence here is much stronger than even the American one. </p><p> <strong>RT</strong>: <em>If so who supports terrorists in Iraq if the role of Iran is so big?</em> </p><p> <strong>MB</strong>: The support is coming from all over the world, from independent people, probably some organizations but not the governments. </p><p style="text-align: right;"> <em>Nadezda Kevorkova, Baghdad</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155988-colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules/</guid><title><![CDATA[Colorado trying to come up with new rules for edible marijuana]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155988-colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/40/00/colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules.jpg" title="Reuters/Jason Redmond"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:26:22 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/15/40/00/colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Following two recent deaths in Colorado believed to be linked to edible marijuana, state officials have decided to examine and rework regulations related to products such as pot cookies and brownies.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/40/00/colorado-edible-marijuana-new-rules.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Jason Redmond" /> <p> According to USA Today, officials will meet on Wednesday to <em>"discuss and consider reasonable amounts of active THC in retail marijuana products in proportion to product serving size."</em> </p><p> Currently, Colorado law states that 10 mg of THC – marijuana’s active ingredient – is equivalent to one serving of the drug, but edible products are not required to be sold in a single serving, nor does the law require pot producers split the package up into separate servings. As reported by the Associated Press, a single package of pot-infused food – sometimes as small as a piece of candy – could contain up to 10 servings of THC. </p><p> <em>"Basically, we are trying to figure out how to come up with a reasonable THC concentration or amount in edibles in proportion to product safety size,"</em> Dr. George Sam Wang of Children's Hospital Colorado told the AP. In the past, Wang has treated children who’d become sick after ingesting pot. </p><p> Earlier this month, NBC reported that a Denver man who shot and killed his wife was reportedly found to have eaten pot candy beforehand, though police said other medication could have been in his system. Police stated the man’s wife was on the phone with 911 asking for help since her husband was <em>“totally hallucinating”</em> and <em>“talking about the end of the world.”</em> By the time police arrived at the house, the wife had been killed with a shotgun. </p><p> In March, meanwhile, a 19-year-old college student from Wyoming died after jumping off the balcony of his hotel room. The student had reportedly eaten an entire pot cookie containing 65 mg of THC – more than six times the recommended dosage in a single serving. According to NBC, the store clerk who sold the cookie suggested breaking it into pieces instead of eating it all at once. </p><p> <em>"Coloradans are used to eating a whole cookie.

Another could be to mandate food to be individually wrapped by serving size. </p><p> So far, marijuana advocates are onboard the effort to take another look at regulations. </p><p> <em>"All of us want to make sure people are safe,"</em> Meg Collins of the Denver-based Cannabis Business Alliance, as well as a member of the task force, told the AP. <em>"The industry is stepping up and is looking at the best ways to educate and communicate to its customers safe ways to recreate with marijuana."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155948-mit-bitcoin-free-experiment/</guid><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin field day: MIT freshmen to get free cryptocurrency]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155948-mit-bitcoin-free-experiment/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/c0/00/mit-bitcoin-free-experiment.jpg" title="Reuters/Jim Urquhart "/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 16:04:52 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/12/c0/00/mit-bitcoin-free-experiment.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Over 4,500 undergrads will each get $100 worth of bitcoin for free once they come back to school this fall as two MIT students plan to conduct the world's largest experiment with the virtual currency.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/c0/00/mit-bitcoin-free-experiment.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Jim Urquhart " /> <p> <em>"We decided to announce this project now to give students lead time,"</em> Dan Elitzer, founder and president of the MIT Bitcoin Club, said in the <a href="http://bitcoin.mit.edu/announcing-the-mit-bitcoin-project/" target="_blank">release</a>. <em>"We want to issue a challenge to some of the brightest technical minds of a generation: When you step on to campus this fall, all of your classmates are going to have access to bitcoin; what are you going to build to give them interesting ways to use it?"</em> </p><p> The MIT Bitcoin Project, as it is called, became possible after Elitzer, who is also an MBA student at MIT's Sloan School of Management, and Jeremy Rubin, 19, - he studies electrical engineering and computer science - raised more than $500,000 in commitments from about 25 donors, MIT alumni. </p><p> Should this experiment go ahead, it will make the MIT campus the first place in the world where it will be possible to have widespread access to bitcoin. </p><p> The project is aimed at building up an ecosystem for digital currencies. However, the two enthusiasts have no clue of how their fellow students – a total of 4,528 undergraduates - will use the bitcoin they will receive this fall. </p><p> It is hoped that such an experiment will spur academic and entrepreneurial activity within the university and give students and researchers a chance to develop bitcoin-related applications. </p><p> <em>“Giving students access to cryptocurrencies is analogous to providing them with internet access at the dawn of the internet era,”</em> said Rubin. </p><p> In the time left to the start of the experiment, Elitzer and Rubin plan to begin preparing the bitcoin ecosystem at MIT, which will involve <em>“working with members of the MIT Bitcoin Club to educate merchants around campus and help them set up to accept bitcoin payments.”</em> </p><p> The fall launch date is intended to give students the summer to work on bitcoin-related projects, Rubin explained. </p><p> <em>“What I’m hoping is that infrastructure gets sufficiently built around MIT that bitcoin actually becomes a useful commodity to have,”</em> Rubin said as cited by the Tech. <em>“I think that MIT should be absolutely the center of the bitcoin universe. As a school that’s a leader in technology and science fields … it’s kind of a shame that we’re not already at this point,”</em> he added. </p><p> The concept of the giveaway bitcoin, reportedly, was initially Rubin's idea that he shared with Elitzer in March. </p><p> The two have been working together to expand it. They originally wanted to give bitcoin to a control group. But Elitzer insisted that every single undergraduate student should take part in the experiment. </p><p> This is not the first bitcoin-related project for both Elitzer and Rubin. </p><p> In 2013, Rubin worked with three other undergraduates on a bitcoin-related project called Tidbit. That experiment, however, ran into trouble: it was subpoenaed by the New Jersey attorney general as part of a consumer fraud investigation. MIT has sent a letter to the New Jersey attorney general in support of Rubin, who is still fighting for the subpoena to be withdrawn. In fact, Rubin and Elitzer met in the fallout of the Tidbit subpoena. </p><p> As for Elitzer, he got interested in bitcoin after working at a non-profit organization, when he saw a potential for cryptocurrencies in countries where people may not have bank accounts. </p><p> Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and completely digital money. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. </p><p> Today, $5.6 billion dollars of bitcoin exist and are traded every day without a central bank, paper currency, or physical security. On April 30, one bitcoin amounts to $443.05. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155944-google-mining-education-app/</guid><title><![CDATA[Google no longer mining student Gmail accounts for targeted ads]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155944-google-mining-education-app/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/80/00/2google-mining-education-app.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Damein Meyer"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:51:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/12/80/00/2google-mining-education-app.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Google will no longer scan student and teacher Gmail messages or use data from Education apps for use in advertising following a legal firestorm that the policy violated privacy rights.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/12/80/00/2google-mining-education-app.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Damein Meyer" /> <p> The policy shift was first announced by Bram Bout, director of Google for Education, in a <a href="http://googleenterprise.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/protecting-students-with-google-apps.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Wednesday. According to Bout, Google has removed a toggle to enable and disable ads in the Apps for Education Administrator console. He noted that without the toggle, ads in the Apps for Education suite are now automatically turned off, and administrators will not be able to turn them back on. </p><p> The Mountain View, California-based tech giant company had been automatically blocking the ads unless administrators changed the controls. </p><p> Bout also noted that similar changes are being made <em>“for all our Google Apps customers, including Business, Government and for legacy users of the free version, and we’ll provide an update when the rollout is complete.”</em> </p><p> On Thursday, at 16:00 GMT, Bout will co-host a <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GoogleforEducation/posts#+GoogleforEducation/posts" target="_blank">Google hangout</a> to discuss the changes and answer questions. <br> Apps for Education is used by primary and secondary schools worldwide, delivering free online applications including Gmail, Docs, and Spreadsheet, among others. Around 30 million students, teachers and administrators use the service today, according to Google. </p><p> While none of those 30 million users were actually shown ads as a result of the service key word scans, their personal information was still collected by Google so that it could be employed for targeted marketing elsewhere online. </p><p> Although Apps for Education users are now free from such intrusive forms of marketing, everyday Gmail users will still see their emails scanned by an automated system for the sake of ads, customization and security. </p><p> Under its recently revamped terms of service, Google state that <em>"our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.”</em> </p><p> Students and other Gmail users sued Google last year in California, claiming the email scanning violated federal and state wiretap laws. According to the Wall Street Journal, that case spurred Google’s policy change. </p><p> During the litigation, Google admitted to scanning emails sent and received by students who attended schools using Apps for Education. Week magazine reported that such practices may violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a law which protects educational records. </p><p> The nine plaintiffs had hoped to file a “class action” suit to gain financial compensation for Gmail users, as well as to force the company to be more open about its policies. In March, however, US District Judge Lucy Koh rejected the move, which would have allowed the plaintiffs to pool their resources, exposed Google to billions of dollars of potential damages, and given them greater leverage to push for a settlement. </p><p> Instead, email users might have to file suit individually or in small groups, lowering claims and increasing the financial burden of pursuing legal action. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155900-superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Devastating’ implications of drug-resistant superbugs now a reality – WHO]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155900-superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/c0/00/superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance.jpg" title="Reuters/Leonhard Foeger"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:41:34 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0f/c0/00/superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Deadly antibiotic-resistant superbugs are a ‘serious threat’ to world health and no longer merely a prediction for the future, according to a new report by the World Health Organization (WHO). Previously treatable illnesses can now once again kill.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/c0/00/superbugs-un-antibiotic-resistance.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Leonhard Foeger" /> <p> <em>“The world is headed for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill,”</em> said Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's assistant director-general for health security. </p><p> The new resistance has the capacity to strike anyone, of any age, on a global scale according to the WHO <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/" target="_blank">report</a>, entitled ‘Antimicrobial resistance: global report on surveillance’, released on Wednesday. It’s the organization’s first ever global report on antibiotic resistance. </p><p> <em>“The implications will be devastating,”</em> stated Fukuda. </p><p> Data spanning 114 different countries was utilized in the study and superbug resistance was found in all regions of the world. The infections were even resistant to a class of antibiotic which fall into a category known as carbapenems – a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic considered one of the last resorts in the treatment of infectious bacterial diseases. </p><p> </p><p> Resistance to last-resort treatments for potentially deadly hospital infections caused by the common Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria have been found in all parts of the world, as has resistance to the most common drugs to treat urinary tract infections caused by E.coli, as well as last resort gonorrhea treatment in 10 developed countries – among them the UK. </p><p> One of the best knows superbugs is MRSA – a staph infection – which is estimated to kill some 19,000 people every year in the US and an equal number in Europe. A new <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/mrsa-spreads-in-households-1.15080" target="_blank">study</a> released last week showed that MRSA, commonly found in hospitals, has settled in a new stronghold – that is US homes, which are a “major reservoir” of a strain called USA300. </p><p> Experts have suggested that the resistance of superbugs stems from the overuse or misuse of antibiotics and <em>“threatens the achievements of modern medicine.”</em> </p><p> Antibiotic resistance is when bacteria adapt and change so that antibiotics no longer work in the treatment of the diseases. </p><p> </p><p> While it has been a prominent 21st century public health concern, the worries have previously remained confined to the realm of predictions rather than actual commentary on present conditions. Resistance was nil when drugs were first introduced to combat such diseases in the 1980s. However, there are now countries where drugs have no impact whatsoever in more than half of all patients. </p><p> <em>“Unless we take significant actions to improve efforts to prevent infections and also change how we produce, prescribe and use antibiotics, the world will lose more and more of these global public health goods and the implications will be devastating,”</em> Fukuda said. </p><p> In response to the WHO report, campaign group Antibiotic Action <em>“specifically”</em> called for steps to be taken. <br> They called for the <em>“establishment of a fully funded global mandatory surveillance program and global/region specific action plans to monitor and contain antimicrobial resistance,”</em> along with advocating strategies to counter the broad global availability of antibiotics. </p><p> <em>“The world needs to respond as it did to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. To do this, we need to be ambitious to succeed – moves such as a fully funded mandatory global surveillance program will document the size of the problem and funded public education will help minimize use – but these are just starting points,”</em> Laura Piddock, director of the group stated. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155976-storm-flooding-florida-alabama/</guid><title><![CDATA[Deadly storms cause massive flooding in Florida and Alabama (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155976-storm-flooding-florida-alabama/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/80/00/storm-flooding-florida-alabama.jpg" title="Photo from Twitter/@IndianaWxOnline"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 15:27:20 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/14/80/00/storm-flooding-florida-alabama.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />As a deadly weather front continued to make its way across the Southern United States late Tuesday and early Wednesday, both Florida and Alabama were struck with severe flooding that’s left at least one person dead.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/14/80/00/storm-flooding-florida-alabama.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo from Twitter/@IndianaWxOnline" /> <p> According to the Associated Press, rainfall in the Florida Panhandle – especially the area around Pensacola – and the coast of Alabama has been relentless, dropping well over a foot of rain in both states.

It would take the position the US has held since 1872.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/40/00/china-overtake-us-economy.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Kevin Lamarque" /> <p> Previous studies have suggested China could become the world's biggest economy by 2019. </p><p> Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese economy has contributed a quarter of total global growth. Between 2011-2014, China’s economy will account for 24 percent, according to IMF estimates. </p><p> In comparison the US economy will only show an increase of 7.6 percent over the same period. </p><p> The predictions are hard to calculate as the latest estimates are based on purchasing power parity. The index attempts to assess the size of an economy based on the assumption that prices of non-tradable goods and services are a lot lower in poorer countries, says the Financial Times (FT). </p><p> The evaluation process of the service may differ, as a haircut in China may cost much less than in the US, however its quality may differ as well. </p><p> The same problem touches upon the quality of tangible goods. A DVD player bought in China may be way cheaper than a US one, however there is no warranty that it will last longer than several months. Besides US goods are sold with far more consumer protection laws, which through more scrutiny and inspection, delivers a better product. </p><p> Another barrier in measuring the true size of the economy is the availability of trusty data, as China is controlled by a secretive authoritarian government that sometimes manipulates data for political purposes. </p><p> It has a huge amount of illegal and unaccounted for ‘shadow’ income sourced from corruption, a sex industry, numerous illegal street vendors, and other services sectors that are not counted in official statistics. Therefore the ‘shadow’ economy could be more than 20 times bigger than official figures report. </p><p> The Chinese economy may be 20 percent larger than official figures show, this it may have overtaken the US several years ago, says the FT. </p><p> Meanwhile the living standards of the average Chinese citizen are still far lower than those in many developing countries. </p><p> According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s economy ranked 93 in per capita purchasing power parity terms. That was just ahead of Turkmenistan and Albania but well behind Libya, Azerbaijan and Surinam. </p><p> That means that on average China’s 1.36 billion people are unlikely to catch up with Western living standards for many decades to come. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155960-presenting-lies-facts-propaganda-exposure/</guid><title><![CDATA[Who's really 'presenting lies as facts'?

(...) Consider the way RT manipulated a leaked telephone <strong><u>call involving former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.</u></strong> Through selective editing, the network made it <strong><u>appear that Tymoshenko advocated violence against Russia.</u></strong> Or the <strong><u>constant reference to any Ukrainian opposed to a Russian takeover of the country as a "terrorist."</u></strong> Or the <strong><u>unquestioning repetition of the ludicrous assertion last week that the United States has invested $5 billion in regime change in Ukraine.</u></strong> <strong><u>These are not facts, and they are not opinions</u></strong>. They are false claims, and when propaganda poses as news it creates real dangers and gives a green light to violence.” </p><p> How many FACTS does Mr. Stengel attempt to deny? Let us count: </p><p> - Yulia Tymoshenko herself has <a href="http://rt.com/news/tymoshenko-calls-destroy-russia-917/">confirmed</a> the authenticity of the conversation that included the following statements: “This is really beyond all boundaries. It's about time we grab our guns and kill those damned Russians together with their leader.” And “I would have found a way to kill those a***es. I hope I will be able to get all my connections involved. And I will use all of my means to make the entire world rise up, so that there wouldn't be even a scorched field left in Russia.” While there was indeed some controversy about a small portion of the recording being altered, Ms. Tymoshenko herself pointed to the source of the tape, not RT, as the guilty party, and the statements quoted above were not in question. Bottom line: if it appears that Ms. Tymoshenko is advocating violence against Russia and Russians – it’s because she blatantly is. </p><p> - Forgetting for a second the absolutely ludicrous supposition, even in theory, of a Russian “takeover” of Ukraine, RT refers those supportive of the current authorities in Kiev as “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGfCLpjEUzk&amp;feature=youtu.be">anti-autonomy,” “pro-unity protesters</a>” and “<a href="http://rt.com/news/155224-ukraine-football-fans-clashes/">pro-Kiev activists</a>.” But you know who is keen on throwing around the “terrorist” moniker? Why, that would be the newly-minted, US-supported Ukrainian government, applying the term <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27035196">to its own people</a> (source: BBC News), as it sends tanks against the anti-government protesters – something that even President Yanukovich, for all his faults, refused to do. </p><p> - Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was the one to <a href="http://youtu.be/U2fYcHLouXY">publicize</a> the $5 billion “investment” in Ukraine’s “European future,” framing it in terms of the United States’ support of Ukraine achieving preconditions for “its European aspirations.” Interestingly enough, that “European future” and those “European aspirations” by definition blatantly ignored and/or rejected the aspirations of the 37 percent of Ukrainians who desired closer relationship with Russia via a trade union, as opposed to the 39 percent in favor of <a href="http://kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=204&amp;page=2"> joining the EU</a> (source: Kiev International Institute of Sociology). How much of that $5 billion went to support the institutions that aided <strong><u>their</u></strong> interests and how much support did Ms. Nuland et al. lend to the <strong><u>democratically</u></strong>-elected president who represented them? Right. Not that anyone is particularly surprised. Wouldn't be the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/04/03/the-big-problem-with-the-cuban-twitter-plan/"> first time</a> that the US benignly “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/bolivias-president-expels-us-aid-agency/2013/05/01/a290899e-b28b-11e2-baf7-5bc2a9dc6f44_story.html">invested</a>” in “democracy” (sources: Washington Post). </p><p> </p><p> Now, how does <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c6HQpH7zWQ">throwing Molotov cocktails</a> (source: Sky News), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkzi6-zz55M">savagely beating officers</a>, and <a href="http://rt.com/news/police-officer-savaged-ukraine-865/">refusing medical aid</a> to the injured while taking over government buildings fit into your definition of “peaceful protesters”? There was indeed brutality on both sides of the barricades (which RT thoroughly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhBk8V-6seo">documented and aired</a>), but you have admit – police officers don’t die by the hand of peaceful demonstrators. </p><p> How is RT behind the “protesters hired snipers” assertions if those concerns were brought to light by the famous leaked (and confirmed <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/05/world/europe/ukraine-leaked-audio-recording/"> authentic</a> – source: CNN) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEgJ0oo3OA8">Ashton-Paet call</a>, by quoting a Maidan medic whose credibility they went to pains to establish? The statement that “there is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition” came not from RT but the Estonian minister. </p><p> And why is the far-right, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SBo0akeDMY">neo-Nazi</a> threat in Ukraine being so flippantly dismissed despite being <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/178013/ukrainian-nationalism-heart-euromaidan"> documented</a> by dozens of Western mainstream media <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/svoboda-ministers-ukraine-new-government-far-right"> outlets</a> (sources: BBC Newsnight, The Nation, Channel 4 UK)? </p><p> The reason you’re seeing citations of sources right here, in the text, is so that it cannot be labeled as another “propaganda” piece full of RT’s own “false” reporting. Or does Mr. Stengel consider all media organizations that report inconvenient facts that challenge his reality to be propaganda outlets? It is very disappointing that a person of his position knows so very little of the reality of the situation in Ukraine, but it certainly explains a lot about the state of US foreign policy. </p><p> Facts are facts, Mr. Stengel. It’s too bad you can’t get your own straight. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155932-elections-in-iraq-blasts/</guid><title><![CDATA[The first post-occupation election in Iraq started with explosions]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155932-elections-in-iraq-blasts/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/11/c0/00/elections-in-iraq-blasts.jpg" title="Sheik Qais Khazaali, leader of the militant group Asaib Ahl Haq, shows his ink-stained finger as he votes during a parliamentary election in Baghdad April 30, 2014.

(Reuters)" /> <p> Five polling stations in Baghdad, Sadr City and Mosul came under attack with varying consequences. The Iraqi Ministry of Interior reported six people killed and 24 injured, but the figures quickly changed to two dozen dead. </p><p> In the morning, the main polling station where security forces vote was crowded. No terrorist can make his way in here. It is in the government quarter close to the Green Zone, separated by concrete walls from the rest of the world. Since 2003, when the Baghdad municipality was destroyed by heavy bombardment, there have been only two ways to get around here: you either walk or you drive a tank. </p><p> For some reason, you are not allowed to take pictures of the graphic scars left by the US bombardment. In fact, the entire system of bans in Iraq is highly contradictory. The current authorities seem to have inherited the disposition for paradoxical prohibitions from the Saddam era. For example, many people would tell you that it was perfectly fine to go for a walk in this area and take any pictures you like. </p><p> Military officers did not look particularly alert or shocked by the deaths of their colleagues. Possibly, it is just not that easy to shock people in Iraq after all they have been through. Under US occupation, 180,000 Iraqis were killed, 150,000 were widowed, 120,000 were orphaned. Even the most pro-American Iraqis think that the lists kept by activists at <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/" target="_blank">database</a> are accurate. In fact, everybody who trusts this organization and uses their figures would tell you that the death toll is actually ten times higher – and this is really scary. </p><p> </p><p> Notepads, cameras and chargers are the things that interest security personnel the most in a journalist’s bag. When I turned my spare battery on and a blue LED light began to blink, a fully veiled female guard searching me ran out of the tent to get the senior officer. When we explained to her that it was only a battery, she immediately stopped hollering and began to apologize with as much zeal. </p><p> Soldiers and officers from different units and in different uniforms kept coming in small groups, taking pictures of each other, taking pictures with me and asking for my Facebook account in order to become Facebook friends with me and post the photo. </p><p> At every checkpoint, they <em>“check”</em> your papers. My green international ID card worked fine in every instance. When I went into the polling station, they wrote down my name in a thick register and gladly demonstrated the voting procedure to me. </p><p> The polling station is set up in a school building. There were long lines to each of the classrooms, and senior officers waited in them just like ordinary soldiers. There was no segregation; on the contrary, there was an atmosphere of camaraderie. After voting, each platoon would take a group picture showing their inky index fingers. </p><p> Contrary to expectations, not all the military voted for the ruling bloc. They were more than willing to explain why they voted for the candidates they voted for. </p><p> What was even more contrary to the view dominating the media is that there were Sunnis among the military who voted for the bloc of the Shiite leader al-Sadr. </p><p> Rayad is not just a Sunni; he is a Sunni from Fallujah, which is currently seized by terrorist groups – al Qaeda and ISIS, Iraqis say. Rayad is the only Sunni in his unit, and he has Shiites under his command. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“The reason I vote for Sadr is not just because he is a good man. He protects everybody regardless of which group they belong to,”</em> Rayad tells me. Most of the people in his police squad vote for al-Sadr, not for al-Maliki’s ruling Shiite bloc. </p><p> The bloc of Muqtada al-Sadr who started a Shiite rebellion against US occupation in Najaf in 2004 runs against the ruling bloc of al-Maliki. It has 40 seats in the parliament and 6 ministerial positions in the government. </p><p> Rayad tells me about his hometown, Fallujah, which is famous for rebelling twice against US occupation in 2004. Now it has been seized by the radicals fighting <em>“infidels,”</em> as they refer to Shiites. </p><p> <em>“Those terrorist groups started their raids seven months ago. They use hit-and-run tactics. There are people from all over the world among them – Syria, Turkey, even Tunisia. I’ve never seen them myself but I know people who have. They quickly move around the city, and they have plenty of weapons. Most residents, including my family, have moved to Baghdad. They just left one man from each family to take care of their houses but it is impossible for the families to remain there,”</em> Rayad says. </p><p> Golsham Kamal Ali, the head of the PR department of the Independent High Electoral Commission, says that the terrorists attacked five polling stations where the servicemen voted. Other than that, she believes, the voting has begun well, and the servicemen are prepared for these attacks in any case. </p><p> A police unit wearing a different kind of uniform walks into the school yard. They have all voted for al-Maliki. <em>“I think he’s the right person for the job, he deserves it. He always acts sensibly, and I respect him”</em>, one of the policemen readily explains. </p><p> </p><p> His fellow policemen are all from Baghdad. They all say their families voted for al-Maliki as well. One of the policemen protests and says he voted for al-Sadr. Many Iraqis are particularly enthusiastic about the elections, because no one makes them cast their votes and they can vote against the ruling regime. They don’t really think about what they’ll get from that. </p><p> <em>“We may be certain that al-Maliki wins and stays in office. He suits both Americans and Iraqis, and these are the two groups that determine everything in Iraq now”</em>. This sentiment has now been repeated by everyone who’s so enthusiastic about the election process that they aren’t even hoping for any kind of change. </p><p> On Tuesday morning a curfew was imposed in some of the Bagdad districts, and access to the city will be restricted before the main voting day on April, 30. </p><p> This is the first post-occupation election in Iraq. There are about 9,000 candidates, one quarter of them women, running for 325 seats in the Parliament. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155868-europe-exports-china-military/</guid><title><![CDATA[EU states strike lucrative military contracts with China overriding embargo - report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155868-europe-exports-china-military/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0d/c0/00/europe-exports-china-military.jpg" title="Helicopters fly past the Chinese Jiangwei II class naval frigate &quot;Luoyang&quot; (Reuters/Guang Niu)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 14:14:26 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0d/c0/00/europe-exports-china-military.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Europe is powering the military rise of China, approving multi-million dollar deals for the transfer of weapons and dual-use technology – despite an arms embargo stemming from the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, AFP reveals.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0d/c0/00/europe-exports-china-military.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Helicopters fly past the Chinese Jiangwei II class naval frigate "Luoyang" (Reuters/Guang Niu)" /> <p> China is the world’s second largest military spender and the fastest growing military market, with Beijing setting aside $132 billion in defense spending. While they are yet to touch the US’ massive $495.6 billion defense budget, China recently announced they would increase military spending by 12.2 percent for 2014. </p><p> <em>“It will take China a long, long time before its budgets will effectively alter the military balance with the US,”</em> Jonathan Holslag of the Brussels Institute of Contemporary China Studies, recently told Stars and Stripes. </p><p> <em>“But that’s not the main concern. While the US still has some scope to respond, neighbors are getting much more nervous… Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines all know that they could be the first victim if the balance of power shifts at America’s detriment.”</em> </p><p> Although Western partners in the East are skittish about China’s rise, Europe seemingly cannot resist the allure of Beijing’s billions. </p><p> </p><p> French designed helicopters bolstering China’s air force, British jet engines driving fighter bombers and anti-ship strike aircraft, German and French engines providing the rudder to the Chinese navy – the role European exports play in China’s military is undeniable. </p><p> <em>“Without European technology, the Chinese navy would not be able to move,"</em> Andrei Chang, editor of the Hong Kong-based Kanwa Asian Defense Review, told AFP. </p><p> EU weapons manufactures received licenses to export equipment worth three billion euros ($4.1 billion) to China in the decade to 2012, annual EU reports on trade reveal. </p><p> The most recent document said arms exports totaling 173 million euros were given the green light in 2012, 80 percent of which were issued by France. A French parliamentary report said the country delivered arms to China worth 104 million euros. </p><blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> The PLA consists of four main service branches: the Ground Force, the Navy, the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps. The total PLA forces hovers at just under 2.3 million. Currently, the Chinese nuclear stockpile is estimated at between 50 and 75 land and sea based ICBM's. The country is believed to have approximately 9,150 tanks. They also are in possession of an estimated 4,788 armored fighting vehicles and 1,770 multiple-launch rocket systems. The country’s air power consists of 2,788 aircraft, including 1,170 fighters, 885 fixed-wing attack aircraft, and 856 helicopters. China has 76 Sukhoi Su-27 air superiority fighters, another 73 Sukhoi Su-30MKK multirole fighters, and 165 domestically manufactured Shenyang J-11 air fighters. China also boasts 1 aircraft carrier, a 520 vessel strong navy including 45 frigates, 24 destroyers, 9 corvettes, and 69 submarines. </p> </blockquote><p> <em>“Already, cynics claim that if the People’s Liberation Army went to war tomorrow, it would employ an arsenal filled with equipment from Germany, France and Britain,"</em> Emil Kirchner, an EU policy expert at Britain's University of Essex, told said. </p><h2> Are exports legal with embargo in place? </h2><p> The European Union imposed an arms embargo on China following the killing of hundreds, if not thousands of protesters during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Analysts, however, say EU states have free will to interpret the embargo as they choose, a reality which has generated tension with the United States. </p><p> An EU spokesman said in a statement that <em>"the final decision to authorize or deny the (arms) export is the responsibility of EU member states."</em> </p><p> The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which monitors arms transfers, estimates that France, Britain and Germany account for 18 percent of Chinese military imports. Russia still provides the bulk of military hardware exports to China. </p><p> At the heart of China’s military modernization is its powerful new submarine fleet, which relies on state-of-the-art diesel engines designed by MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH of Friedrichshafen, Germany. </p><p> For Western states, these exports can impact the security of their allies. In January 2013, tensions nearly boiled over after a Jiangwei-class Chinese frigate locked fire-control radar on a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense destroyer and a helicopter near the disputed Senkaku/ Diaoyu Islands. </p><p> Military experts believe the ship relies on diesel engines produced by German firm MTU, AFP reports. </p><p> Another Chinese ship, a Jiangkai-class vessel, uses engines made by SEMT Pielstick, a French diesel engine manufacturer owned by German firm MAN Diesel and Turbo, according to analysts and specifications posted on Chinese military websites. </p><p> </p><p> MAN told AFP that its Chinese licensees have supplied about 250 engines to China's navy. MTU said it <em>"acts strictly according to the German export laws,</em>" without elaborating. </p><p> Meanwhile, in March Airbus Helicopters and China’s Avicopter – the helicopter business unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) – penned a joint agreement for the production of 1,000 new generation EC175/AC352 rotorcraft at the Elysée Palace in Paris. Chinese President Xi Jinping and French President Francois Hollande were present for the signing. </p><p> Citing the co-production deal signed in France, Chang said: <em>"China uses the name of civil purchase to purchase French helicopter engines, and they shift those engines into military helicopters.</em> </p><p> <em>If (China) knows how to design the middle-sized EC175, they will know how to design a middle-sized military transport helicopter.”</em> </p><p> Meanwhile, the Netherlands is also behind 18 million euros' worth of "vessels of war" or their accessories and components, while the acquisition of a British-made Airborne Early Warning (AEW) platform for the latest Chinese surveillance aircraft has provided a boost to the People’s Liberation Army Air Force. </p><p> The Chinese defense ministry has previously said reports of the People’s Liberation Army dependence on foreign arms technology are exaggerated. <em>"According to international practice, China is also engaged in communication and cooperation with some countries in the area of weaponry development,"</em> the ministry said in a statement responding to this series. <em>"Some people have politicized China's normal commercial cooperation with foreign countries, smearing our reputation."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155904-ukraine-economy-crisis-q1/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pain for Ukraine: Economy loses 1.1 percent in Q1]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155904-ukraine-economy-crisis-q1/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/00/00/2ukraine-economy-crisis-q1.jpg" title="Reuters/Gleb Garanich"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:52:15 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/10/00/00/2ukraine-economy-crisis-q1.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine’s economy contracted 1.1 percent in the first three months of 2014, Ukraine’s Statistical Service reported Wednesday. This poor performance puts the economy on track to slow 4 percent overall in 2014.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/00/00/2ukraine-economy-crisis-q1.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Gleb Garanich" /> <p> The preliminary estimate compares to a 1.2 percent drop in the same 3-month period in 2013, and a 2 percent GDP fall in the fourth quarter, data also provided by Ukraine's <a href="http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/Noviny/new2014/zmist/21_u.htm" target="_blank">Statistics Office</a>. There was zero growth in 2013, and the IMF has forecast a 4 percent contraction in 2014. </p><p> The past few months have been tumultuous times for Ukraine, which has been the epicenter of violent protests that reveal the deep political divide between the West and East. In February, a provisional government took control of Kiev in the course of events viewed as a coup in Russia. Presidential elections will be held May 25. </p><p> But Ukraine’s economy had been headed towards default long before Maidan protests began in November 2013 when then-President Viktor Yanukovich refused to sign a trade agreement with the European Union. </p><p> Gold and foreign exchange reserves are quickly depleting, and currently stand at $12 billion. In February, before the coup-appointed government took power, reserves had reached a critical level of $18 billion. In 2013, more than $4 billion in international reserves were wiped out. </p><p> Reserves are nearly gone because Ukraine’s Central Bank has spent billions on currency intervention to prop up the sinking hryvnia, which has depreciated 28 percent against the dollar this year. </p><p> The sliding hryvnia is also adding pressure on government solvency, as over a half of Ukraine’s debt is denominated in foreign currency. </p><p> Inflation is expected to continue to rise, with the IMF predicting 12 percent in 2014. </p><p> The Ukrainian Central Bank is also tapping into the country’s reserves to pay off the country’s fast-accumulating debt. </p><p> Finance Minister Vitaliy Lisovenko said the government has $9 billion in foreign-currency debt payments this year. </p><p> The country owes at least <a href="http://rt.com/business/gas-war-ukraine-russia-845/" target="_blank">$2.2 billion</a> to Russia’s Gazprom, but says this obligation will not be a priority. State-owned Naftogaz is on the brink of bankruptcy, because it has been selling gas domestically for only a fraction of the import price. </p><p> A Eurobond sale could help stabilize the financial situation, Deputy Finance Minister Vitaliy Lisovenko said Friday April 25. The Eurobond sale would be under a US guarantee. </p><h2> ‘Help’ on the way </h2><p> Ukraine is waiting for a final loan figure from the International Monetary Fund, a package expected to be upwards of <a href="http://rt.com/business/imf-ukraine-financial-help-105/" target="_blank">$18 billion</a>. Details on the package are expected to be announced today. The first tranche will come in May. </p><p> An additional $750 million from the World Bank, 600 million euro from the European Union, and $100 million from Japan in aid will make its way to Kiev. The US has also promised <a href="http://rt.com/business/congress-approves-aid-ukraine-881/" target="_blank">$1 billion</a> in loan guarantees to help the collapsing Ukraine economy. However, so far these are just promises and no physical funds have been transferred to torn apart Ukraine. </p><p> <em>"Of course we need a fully fledged agreement with the IMF but the European Union is ready for macro-financial aid in the framework of the overall package. So we are ready to support Ukraine,"</em> European Council President Herman Van Rompuy told reporters Wednesday. </p><p> In December, Russia provided Ukraine with a <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-15-billion-gas-381/" target="_blank">$15 billion</a> ‘no-strings-attached’ loan, but so far, the West hasn’t delivered on any of its promises to help Ukraine. </p><p> Under the terms of the Russia-Ukraine deal signed in December, Ukraine's debt shouldn’t exceed 60 percent of GDP. This means that technically Russia has the right to demand the money back before the bonds are due in 2015. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155916-america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[US-Russia relations need a return to reason]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155916-america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/c0/00/america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Reuters)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:44:34 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/c0/00/america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The second wave of US sanctions against Russian officials and the heated rhetoric exchange between the leaders of both countries, with each side blaming the other, show without a doubt that US-Russia relations have bottomed out.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/c0/00/america-russia-tensions-over-ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Reuters)" /> <p> It is time to abandon political posturing and introduce some rationality to the discussion. The stakes are too high to allow this confrontation between Washington and Moscow to continue, as the consequences are unpredictable. </p><p> The violent chaos spreading in Ukraine has the potential to spark a much wider conflict in Europe on a scale not seen since 1945. The expansion of NATO military hardware and personnel along Russia's borders and the threats of further devastating Western sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy are pushing us towards a nightmare scenario that neither the US nor its European allies are prepared to face. </p><p> A certain modicum of cynicism and hypocrisy is perhaps unavoidable in foreign policy, but choosing to overlook any of the interim Kiev government's wrongdoings, and blaming every instance of violence on Russian provocateurs exceeds these limits – or, to borrow from US President Barack Obama's parlance, crosses every red line. </p><p> It is true that some opposing views occasionally penetrate the Western media's wall of anti-Russian consensus, but their numbers are as few as those of Soviet-era dissidents in a KGB-dominated state. </p><p> The recent Geneva agreement was a step in the right direction, but it has not changed the untenable situation on the ground. The real question now is who is going to put it into effect? </p><p> For example, Kiev has not followed through on its promise to disarm illegally armed militant groups – such as the nationalist Right Sector paramilitary group – which was one of the vital points of the Geneva deal. Nor does it show any inclination that it will do so any time soon. </p><p> The greatest danger here is that Ukraine is edging closer and closer toward a full-scale civil war by the day. But there is an even greater danger of the conflict escalating into a direct military confrontation between US-led NATO forces and Russia, a scenario with the most horrific consequences for both sides. </p><p> A NATO intervention in Ukraine, followed by a reciprocal move by Russia, is not a desirable outcome. Therefore, as tensions rise and the conditions in Ukraine continue to deteriorate, policymakers in Washington and Moscow need to recognize the extremely urgent need to find a means of extricating themselves from this crisis. This should be done before it transforms from a regional crisis to a full-blown international conflagration. </p><p> During a recent interview, President Vladimir Putin offered Washington an opportunity to break this futile cycle of mutual accusation and ineffectual posturing. <em>"I think there is nothing that would hinder normalization and normal cooperation with the West. This does not depend on us, or rather not only on us. This depends on our partners,"</em> said Putin. In the same interview he welcomed the appointment of former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg as the next NATO secretary-general. </p><p> Regardless of your opinion of Putin, since first taking office 15 years ago he has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness and ability to constructively cooperate with the US on major issues. Even today, crucial US air supplies to the NATO-backed security forces in Afghanistan are made easier by Russia, which provides secure access via its Northern Air Corridor. Both nations share the same security concerns with regard to the spread of nuclear weapons and terror threats from radical Islamists. </p><p> To be sure, it is Washington that holds practically all the keys to a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. Not only has it helped to install the present government but, judging from the incessant visits of senior US officials to Kiev, it is they who are calling the shots. </p><p> Kiev's actions, paired with Washington's threat of additional sanctions and failure to push for a compromise by implementing the Geneva agreement, raise the fears that we are quickly moving toward a situation that both sides might end up deeply regretting. </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Edward Lozansky and Martin Sieff for RT</span></em> </p><p> <span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);"><em>Edward Lozansky is President of the American University in Moscow</em></span> </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Martin Sieff is a Senior Fellow of the American University in Moscow</span></em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155784-twitter-posts-132m-loss/</guid><title><![CDATA[Twitter’s $132bn Q1 loss sends shares tumbling more than 11%]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155784-twitter-posts-132m-loss/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/08/80/00/twitter-postsm-loss.jpg" title="Reuters/Brendan McDermid"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:43:54 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/08/80/00/twitter-postsm-loss.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Shares in the social network Twitter have fallen 11.1 percent on market opening in New York on Wednesday after the company announced disappointing first quarter results.

He also underlined the fact that those actions are accompanied by provocative statements by NATO’s Secretary General about the need to withhold Russia,”</em> the statement from the Defense Ministry said. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155912-us-sanctions-against-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Sanctions: The sanctimonious solution]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155912-us-sanctions-against-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/80/00/us-sanctions-against-russia.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama (Reuters/Larry Downing)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:05:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/80/00/us-sanctions-against-russia.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />As Moscow withdrew its troops from the border with Ukraine, President Obama announced further sanctions against Russian politicians and businessmen to a chorus of economists gleefully predicting the havoc to be wrought on the Russian economy.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/10/80/00/us-sanctions-against-russia.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="U.S. President Barack Obama (Reuters/Larry Downing)" /> <p> Of course, there’s not much evidence that sanctions have every actually achieved anything beyond making life difficult for lesser or greater numbers of people. Furthermore, the entire idea runs counter to the creed of global market liberalization so openly embraced by the very people who support slapping sanctions on anyone who indicates that they may not be in complete accord with them on each and every topic under the sun. </p><p> The World Trade Organization (WTO), for example, was supposed to prevent nations from using their economies as a tool in the service of their own political interests. This has long served as the rationale for the WTO’s limited consideration of social rights or the environment when rendering its decisions. </p><p> In the world of international law, sanctions are therefore a bit passé, really. They may have sounded like a good idea 20 years ago, but we’ve all moved on since then. </p><p> Thus, the idea that the USA and Europe are somehow going to bludgeon Russia into submission using a tool that much-more-vulnerable Cuba has blithely held out against for over half a century, is at first glance, worth a laugh. After all, it’s an open secret that the only country the US has managed to isolate with its sanctions has long been itself. In fact, before Gaddafi was ousted in 2011, the United States was – thanks to the long-standing Pan-Am controversy – virtually the only country that wasn’t getting oil concessions out of Libya. </p><p> Much has been said about the overweening arrogance sanctioning Russia displays Max Keiser’s <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/155120-living-behind-cnn-curtain/" target="_blank">article</a> earlier this week was particularly interesting, especially since it hasn’t been possible to portray these sanctions as the usual punishment for not having a <em>‘democratic’</em> government. Are Western leaders really so out of touch that they think Russia will give in because it is being sanctioned by the US and Europe? </p><p> I doubt it. </p><p> There’s a deeper game here and it is as follows: 1) sanctioning Russia makes it look like Western leaders are actually doing something (thereby satisfying public opinion at home); 2) if I were a betting woman, I would put money on it coming out someday that these sanctions were laid down in a manner curiously advantageous to certain Western businesses; 3) as far as Western leaders are concerned it isn’t Russia that is the problem, it’s Putin. I think they’ve gotten the message that Putin is not the <em>‘caving in’</em> type. So rather than get him to back down, they’d probably rather just get rid of him. Hence the litany of complaints personally directed against Putin over the past several months. </p><p> It might surprise many Russians to learn that a large segment of the North American population believes that Vladimir Putin is an unelected dictator and that they are paranoid of being put under surveillance by him. I understand that you may need to read that twice to take it all in. Most people react to my telling them that I write for RT as if I have just announced that I have a license to kill. </p><p> But difficult as it is, try to see things from the point of view of your average Western power-broker. They can remember the good old times, when Yeltsin was in charge (using that term loosely) and Russia was an investment bonanza, a real <em>“free market”</em>, plentiful in crony capitalism with minimal social security and all the natural resources you can take. </p><p> They would like that back. </p><p> And after that, they would like a similar arrangement in China, please. </p><p> Once that is accomplished everyone will finally be on the same wavelength and the world will be remarkably conflict-free. It wouldn’t matter so much where Ukraine chose to make its political and economic alliances, because under this scenario the money would all be flowing into the same pockets, anyway and at a rate rapid enough to keep everyone satisfied. </p><p> </p><p> And Western leaders think that they have a certain chance of getting Part 1 of their policy taken care of, because they are hoping that if they can cause the Russian economy to tank, it will eventually, when the dust has settled, hit Putin’s popularity so hard as to hurt his chances of re-election. This is a basic tactic that is used a lot in international negotiations. It’s played by getting anyone you think is a tough negotiator removed from their job by spreading misinformation about them back to their home government or simply outright demanding that the home government sack them in order for negotiations to proceed at all. </p><p> You can see both of these tactics at play in regards to Putin at the moment. I’m all for a healthy dose of criticism in domestic politics, but Russia as spy state using covert operations to topple governments while simultaneously placing us all under surveillance sounds a lot like Western leaders just cobbled together everyone’s complaints about them and hurled them at the new/old arch-enemy. Classic misinformation. </p><p> Sanctions are an example of tactic two: I don’t like you so I’m not going to deal with you. If your country wants to talk to me they have to send someone with a better attitude, which means someone who thinks that the word ‘negotiation’ means that we do whatever I want. People sometimes wonder at the high proportion of idiots given government posts. Now you know. If you have a backbone, your survival chances decrease dramatically, because you get hit-listed. </p><p> Consider further that this kind of aggressive action is necessary for Western leaders, because their backs are already against the wall. Their own constituents are fed-up to levels that haven’t been seen since the 1960s, with inequality growing daily. The largest political parties have already decided that they are in the game for themselves, with few differences to speak of between their policies. Thus, they only have two choices – continue going with whatever policies suit their wealthy campaign backers or do an about-face and start compromising with <em>‘the people’</em>. </p><p> Needless to say, that would burn the bridge with campaign financiers, and since that relationship has been ongoing for a very long time, taking the plunge to change things around seems like a pretty big risk. So no one does it, and they just continue doing what they’ve done for the last 20 years, which is to try to steamroll everything in their path. </p><p> This is the real logic behind sanctions: an attempt to make the Russian leadership unpopular with its own businesses and citizens to the point that a more conciliatory party and leader are elected. No easy task, clearly, since imposing sanctions which exclusively hit Russia involves a fair bit of cherry-picking. </p><p> Western politicians seem determined to follow this course to the bitter end rather than acknowledge that their own political interests may not be the only ones on Earth or that we might be under some sort of obligation to negotiate with the elected leaders of other nations. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155908-ukraine-drills-kiev-military/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukraine Defense Ministry denies military drills planned in Kiev]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155908-ukraine-drills-kiev-military/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/40/00/ukraine-drills-kiev-military.jpg" title="Reuters/Valentyn Ogirenko"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 12:20:18 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/10/40/00/ukraine-drills-kiev-military.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukrainian armed forces aren’t planning to hold any military drills involving armored vehicles in central Kiev on Wednesday night, the country’s Defense Ministry said, refuting an earlier announcement from the mayor’s office in Kiev.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/10/40/00/ukraine-drills-kiev-military.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Valentyn Ogirenko" /> <p> A <a href="http://kievcity.gov.ua/news/14504.html" target="_blank">short statement</a> was published on Kiev City Hall’s website early on Wednesday, warning <em>“residents and guests of the capital”</em> of a special tactical drill to <em>“be held in Kiev on the night of April 30 to May 1.”</em> <br><br> The announcement attracted huge attention from both the media and Kiev residents, as it promised <em>“columns of combat vehicles”</em> moving through the city during the exercise. <br><br> However, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry hurried to refute the claims by the mayor’s office, stating that the country's armed forces were not planning to hold any military drills in the capital. <br><em><br> “The announcement of a special tactical exercise, which was posted today – April 30 – on the official website of the Kiev city administration has nothing to do with the activities of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,”</em> a <a href="http://www.mil.gov.ua/index.php?lang=ua&amp;part=news&amp;sub=read&amp;id=34288" target="_blank">statement</a> on the Defense Ministry’s website said. <br><em><br> “The personnel and military vehicles of the city’s garrison remain at the place of their permanent location. Their deployment in the city’s center is not expected,”</em> the statement added. <br><br> Later on Wednesday, Kiev's Mayor Vladimir Bondareko appeared on Ukrainian television to clarify the situation. <br><br> He stated that only troops from the State Guard and Interior Ministry – not the army – would be taking part in the night drill. <br><br><em>"Today we are working with units...which must protect the population in case of certain events. So, today we’ll try to train the movement of these units. They will arrive in of Pechersk district (a historical neighborhood in central Kiev), where the government institutions are situated, and then return to their bases,”</em> Bondareko said. <br><br> The mayor explained that the exercises are vital due to the events taking place in southeastern Ukraine. Protests against the coup-imposed Ukrainian government are on the rise in the region, with anti-Kiev activists seizing administrative buildings and demanding a referendum on federalization. <br><br> "We must be ready for everything, and Kiev’s city administration is doing all it can that if, God forbid, something happens, we’ll be able to hide in shelters and get water; so that we knew where to go for medical aid,” he stressed. </p><p> Earlier Ukraine’s coup-appointed President Aleksandr Turchinov announced that the army is now in a state of high alert due to the "<em>real threat</em>" of a Russian military invasion. </p><p> At the same time he admitted that Kiev cannot control the situation in the east of Ukraine, where anti-government protesters are continuing to take over government buildings. </p><p> The clashes on Tuesday night happened between an ultra-nationalist Social-National Assembly, a faction of the Right Sector militant group and members of the Maidan self-defense militia, as the nationalists were holding a torch rally through central Kiev. </p><p> Many Ukrainian nationalists are appalled by the Ukrainian government’s failure to crackdown on the eastern Ukrainian protest. Some even call for another change at the top. </p><p> Some Ukrainian officials branded the torch rally as a provocation inspired by Russia, although no explanation was given as to how Russia could have any influence on that group. </p><p> Ukraine’s central authorities previously tried to use the military against the protesters in the east, but this proved to be inefficient. The morale of the troops is low, and there were cases of some soldiers defecting to the protesters instead of fighting against them. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155884-juice-news-israel-palestine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Juice News: Mid-East Peace malady (ft.

(AFP Photo)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What do you make of Kerry's taking back his comments on the apartheid character of Israel and what does it say about the US commitment to the peace process and two-state solution?</em> </p><p> <strong>Nabil Shaath:</strong> I think the US is committed to a two-state solution and it remains committed to some peace process, but they realize that it is very difficult to get anything done with the present Israeli government. The last 9 month were frustrating - the Israeli government today does not believe in any of the international commitments that it made before in the Oslo agreement, in the road map, in Napoli and many other places, starting in Madrid in 1991. Therefore it is very difficult really to reach the two-states solution when Israelis are eating up the occupied territory in the West Bank and they are really treating us [Palestinians] like the [black] South Africans were treated during the apartheid system. It is very difficult really to have a peace process. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong><em>What about US diplomacy that can’t be honest with its partner in trying to find a solution?</em> </p><p> <strong>NS:</strong> The US Secretary of State has his commitments and has his diplomatic language. Once in a while I think it becomes very frustrating, so he expresses the truth and then finds it very difficult to swallow. This is not the first time that it’s happened… if you recall in 1991 at the Madrid conference, President Bush, and Foreign Secretary James Baker took a harsh position against Mr. Shamir and in fact withdrew $10 billion of loan guarantees that the US committed to give to Israel in order to get Israel to move on the peace process and to go to the Madrid conference. I think it’s the responsibility of the US to do so… not only to put pressure on the Palestinians. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>A deal was struck recently among rival factions, Hamas and Fatah. Israel considers Hamas a terrorist group. How can the peace process go forward with Hamas unwilling to recognize Israel?</em> </p><p> <strong>NS:</strong> It’s very ironic that Mr Netanyahu said this, while he has in his cabinet people like Naftali Bennett and others who totally negate the peace process, totally negate any commitment to the process and who very clearly declare their extreme positions on never accepting a Palestinian state. If you really look at the way the Israeli army has been dealing with our people and the settlers have been dealing with our people, during these negotiations 60 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli army or settlers. If Mr Netanyahu wants peace he has to accept the Palestinian people together, in one package, in one state. He has no the right to divide Palestinians. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>But if you struck a deal between Hamas and Fatah, then any sort of peace process will be delayed because of Israel’s reaction. Couldn’t those factions have postponed joining together?</em> </p><p> <strong>NS:</strong> No, we have to unite our people because the Israelis have been telling us we cannot negotiate with you if you do not represent Gaza, if you represent only the West Bank we cannot have peace with all the Palestinians. And now they say the contrary: <em>“If you have Gaza and the West Bank together, we don’t want peace with you.”</em> The unity we are seeking with Hamas is a democratic unity that will be based on elections and the Palestinian people will decide, and there are commitments that we have made that we will keep and there is the constitution of the PNA [Palestinian National Authority] that has made peace with Israelis that will be kept. But it’s the Palestinian people who will decide that in the elections. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155896-kerry-blames-eu-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Kerry rebuked EU for inciting Ukraine ‘tug of war’– report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155896-kerry-blames-eu-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0f/80/00/kerry-blames-eu-ukraine.jpg" title="Anti-government protesters detain a policeman (2nd L) during clashes in the Independence Square in Kiev February 20, 2014.

(Reuters/Yannis Behrakis)" /> <p> <em>“Some folks in Europe made mistakes, the association agreement became too much of an East-West tug of war. It shouldn’t have been,”</em> US Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly said at a private meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Washington last Friday. His words were quoted by the Daily Beast on Tuesday. </p><p> Russia has long insisted that the EU and the US sparked the political crisis in Ukraine last October. The EU Association Agreement, which President Viktor Yanukovich refused to sign after long deliberation, would require Ukraine to sever or downgrade many of its economic ties with Russia, which would hurt greatly its economy. Yanukovich’s decision triggered the protest in Kiev, which eventually escalated into an armed coup that deposed him. </p><p> European and American officials rejected Russia’s view of the ill-fated agreement, insisting it would not damage Ukraine’s trade with Russia. But apparently in private conversation American diplomats don’t follow the narrative. </p><p> The division between the US and the EU over Ukraine was highlighted earlier in February after a recording of a phone conversation between Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and American Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt <a href="http://rt.com/news/nuland-phone-chat-ukraine-927/" target="_blank">was leaked</a>. </p><p> They were discussing the foreign effort to help anti-Yanukovich opposition create what has now became the new Ukrainian government and expressed frustration at EU’s hesitance on the matter, culminated by the infamous “F**k the EU” exclamation from Nuland. </p><p> </p><p> Kerry’s private comment on the EU’s role in the crisis is just a small part of the Daily Beast report. The majority was focused on the alleged evidence that the US had of Russian agents acting in Ukraine to stir up protest. While the website initially implied that the evidence had been recorded by US intelligence, the State Department later clarified that the reported remarks were related to recordings produced by the Ukrainian government. </p><p> Kiev published a six-minute recording, which it said proved the presence of Russian secret agents in Ukraine, two weeks ago. This was one day after a disastrous attack on protester-held Slavyansk, in which then-head of the Anti-Terrorist Center of the Ukrainian Security Service was injured. However, the evidence was far from conclusively damning for Russia. </p><p> Another package of evidence Ukraine produced so far, which the US State Department endorsed, proved to be faulty. The alleged photo evidence case quickly collapsed, with the New York Times, which headlined it, having to publish a follow-up <a href="http://rt.com/news/154548-pictures-russian-troops-false/" target="_blank">admitting</a> its failure to properly verify it. </p><p> Following Kerry’s previous remarks on the alleged Russian involvement in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov <a href="http://rt.com/news/154832-russian-agents-ukraine-lavrov/" target="_blank">challenged</a> his counterpart to produce any real proof. </p><p> <em>“Kerry has many times mentioned that Ukrainian intelligence captured Russian agents,”</em> he said. <em>“So, show them to the people, have them on TV. Kerry says they don’t want to disclose the identities of those people who are engaged in the captures. This is not serious.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155832-elections-in-iraq-security-sectarianism/</guid><title><![CDATA[Iraq election could bring Sunni and Shia reconciliation]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155832-elections-in-iraq-security-sectarianism/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0b/80/00/elections-in-iraq-security-sectarianism.jpg" title="A fully-veiled woman shows her ink-stained finger at a polling station during voting for Iraqi parliamentary election in Baghdad April 30, 2014.

Basically there have been about a hundred years of sectarian divide between the Sunnis and the Shias… it’s going back to the founding of state in the 1920s. As a result, this political tension, even after the US intervention in 2003, has still found a way to permeate society and increase violence. The reason that the government is ineffective is because of long-term traditional problems within the sectarian communities and also because of US inability to bring political results after the post-2003 invasion. So a combination of the two – history and US intervention. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>You fought in the Iraq war. Do you think the invasion helped the country in any way, and what is your view on military interventions in general?</em> </p><div class="cont-wp advance-extra"> <blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> On April 30 Iraq is holding its first ever parliamentary elections since the withdrawal of US troops. However, the sectarian tensions in the country are extremely high, while Iraq itself is a fragmented state, and these facts do affect the ongoing voting. Though security level was increased significantly, the two days before elections were shaded by a wave of deadly attacks. </p> </blockquote> </div><p> <strong>JD:</strong> It’s funny to look at the modern security environment that Iraq faces, and Syria and Lebanon face…. it’s increasingly apparent that third party interventions are not working out for the benefit of Iraqis, Syrians, and Lebanese. These kinds of sectarian solutions need to come from within, they need to come from domestic political resolutions and they need to come from the international community, pushing this sort of thing through the UN and through the Security Council, but how it works in neo-imperial colonial style through coercion and force, it doesn’t seem to have worked so far very well in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria or other places. I don’t think that tradition is going to change in the very near future. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What impact has the civil war in Syria had on the security situation in Iraq?</em> </p><p> <strong>JD:</strong> Indeed. It’s interesting to see that the sectarian violence in Iraq bled over into Syria after the Bashar Al-Assad regime had its political squabbles. And as a result, Iraq has bled over Syria and rebels have increasingly gained the territory, and there is an increasingly porous border with Turkey that the Syrian civil war has then penetrated back into Iraq. Just to quote Muqtada al-Sadr, very famous Shia militant leader, he has said that Al-Qaeda, Al-Sham, and the Islamic State of the Levant are everywhere, in every corner of the street. Syria has bled over in Iraq, Iraq has bled over in Syria and the problem cannot be seen as an Iraqi problem or a Syrian problem. Now the problem of the Islamic State of the Levant and Islamic State of Al-Sham is a regional problem. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>A general election is coming up, what do you think the outcome will be?</em> </p><p> <strong>JD:</strong> The looming political elections going on in Iraq are going to bring two possible problems and two possible very good events. The first problem, that is the biggest problem, could be the increasingly sectarian tensions that would be further dividing society. The other problem is that Al-Qaeda could demonstrate itself as a power force by bombing election cycles, intimidating communities, and as a result, some groups may want to boycott the elections out of fear. This occurred in 2005 most prominently. The two good things to come, if in fact that it is a fair and relatively diplomatic election, you will see increasing cooperation between Sunni and Shia political leaders. The other positive thing that could occur is greater stability in the country. I definitely think that Al-Qaeda will make a stand, some people will be intimidated. So it’s likely that we are going to have some violence, it is likely there is going to be some corruption, but it is also likely that the political establishment in Iraq is going to try to stand for communities and not to be pressured by extremists. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/155836-mironov-ponomaryov-russia-crimea/</guid><title><![CDATA[Fair Russia leader seeks to oust MP for opposing Crimea accession]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/155836-mironov-ponomaryov-russia-crimea/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0b/c0/00/mironov-ponomaryov-russia-crimea.jpg" title="State Duma deputy Ilya Ponomaryov (Reuters/Maxim Shemetov)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 11:13:32 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0b/c0/00/mironov-ponomaryov-russia-crimea.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Sergey Mironov has demanded that State Duma deputy, Ilya Ponomaryov, quit his post as his behavior damaged the reputation of the Fair Russia party.

Technically, Ponomaryov was still a member of the Fair Russia caucus, despite recently leaving the party and this was causing reputational damage to the party, Mironov claimed. </p><p> “<em>Speaking for the whole party, I do not request, but demand – stop clinging to your seat, give up the mandate</em>!” the letter reads. </p><p> In addition, the Fair Russia leader reminded Ponomaryov of the political legacy of his family and asked him not to tarnish his family’s name. Ponomaryov’s mother, Larisa Ponomaryova, was a long time Upper House member and his great-uncle, Boris Ponomaryov, was a top Communist Party official in the Soviet Union. </p><p> Ilya Ponomaryov was elected to the State Duma in 2007 and in 2011 on Fair Russia’s ticket, but their ways parted after Ponomaryov, along with with <a href="http://rt.com/politics/opposition-party-expels-two-senior-members-for-siding-with-street-protesters-245/" target="_blank">two other MPs</a>, took part in <a href="http://rt.com/news/moscow-adoption-law-protest-908/" target="_blank">mass protests</a> against alleged violations at the 2011 parliamentary polls. Fellow parliamentarians, including Mironov, said that if Ponomaryov considered the elections to be unfair he should not occupy the seat received in the very same elections, but the MP refused to leave. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/politics/vice-president-sacked-graft-932/" target="_blank">Another scandal</a> involving Ponomaryov took place in early 2013 when a team of investigators discovered that a senior vice-president of the Skolkovo innovation hub paid the MP $750,000 to deliver 10 lectures and one research paper. The probe and subsequent court hearings proved these facts to be true. The executive in charge was suspended and the MP was ordered to return the money. Ponomaryov pleaded not guilty, saying that the fees were fair and proportional to the amount of work. </p><p> Following this second scandal, Ponomaryov announced in October 2013 that he was quitting the Fair Russia party, but would remain in the State Duma as Russian law allows this. </p><p> Ponomaryov reiterated this intention in comments to Mironov’s open letter – “<em>This is not going to happen – I received this mandate from the voters of Novosibirsk Region and I will fight to the end for the interests of my region and my country</em>,” the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. </p><p> In early April, several deputies from the nationalist party LDPR drafted a parliamentary statement on depriving four Fair Russia MPs of their places in parliament for not supporting the bills on Crimea’s reunification with Russia (Ponomaryov voted against and the other three abstained from voting). However, the document was rejected as it contradicted the federal law on the status of State Duma deputies that only allows such moves in extraordinary cases like high-profile criminal probes against politicians. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155848-russia-in-recession-imf/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Russia in recession’ – IMF]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155848-russia-in-recession-imf/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0c/80/00/russia-in-recession-imf.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Maxim Marmur"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 10:51:39 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/0c/80/00/russia-in-recession-imf.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Russia is experiencing recession, and the 2014 growth forecast has been cut to 0.2 percent from 1.3 percent, the International Monetary Fund mission chief to Moscow said on Wednesday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0c/80/00/russia-in-recession-imf.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Maxim Marmur" /> <p> Ukraine and Western-led sanctions are partly to blame, as political tension has dragged down the economic forecast for Russia, which at the beginning of the year, the IMF estimated could reach 3 percent. </p><p> However, Russia was already experiencing recession, IMF mission chief Antonio Spilimbergo told reporters Wednesday. </p><p> <em>"If you understand by recession two quarters of negative economic growth then Russia is experiencing recession now,"</em> Spilimbergo told reporters Wednesday, citing last year’s weak growth of 2013 as evidence. </p><p> Sanctions are hurting the Russian economy, the IMF said. This week both the <a href="http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/">US</a> and the <a href="http://rt.com/news/155620-eu-japan-sanctions-russia/">EU</a> rolled out new sanctions against Moscow for a perceived ‘failure’ of peacekeeping in eastern Ukraine. Moscow maintains Kiev has done next to <a href="http://rt.com/news/155772-ukraine-geneva-agreements-churkin/">nothing</a> to de-escalate the conflict. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/news/eastern-ukraine-army-operation-680/" target="_blank">Turmoil in Ukraine</a> has caused instability in Russian stock markets, and has made investors uneasy about the region. </p><p> Capital outflows are a major concern, and the IMF estimates that in 2014, more than $100 billion will leave Russia. </p><p> The Russian government has estimated capital outflow in 2014 could reach between $70-80 billion. In the first 3 months of 2014, $50.6 billion trickled out of the Russian economy. </p><p> <em>"The difficult situation and especially the uncertainty surrounding the geopolitical situation and follow up of sanctions and escalation of sanctions are weighing very negatively on the investment climate,"</em> Spilimbergo said. </p><p> However, high oil prices continue to have a stabilizing effect on the domestic economy and state finances. Oil and gas export revenues account for more than half of the Russian budget. </p><p> The Washington-based IMF said that in order for Russia to offset the impact of the geopolitical tension in Ukraine, the country must ensure macroeconomic stability. </p><p> The ruble has lost more than 9 percent against the dollar since the beginning of 2014. Last week Russia’s Central Bank unexpectedly <a href="http://rt.com/business/154840-russia-rates-cbr-ukraine/" target="_blank">raised</a> its key interest rate in order to combat inflation. The IMF chief forecast that consumer prices would rise 6 percent in 2014. </p><p> Part of the reasons the ruble has fallen so ‘dramatically’ is because of the Central Bank’s decision to normalize the overvalued currency, which it wants to be free-floating by 2015, a goal the IMF supports. </p><p> Standard &amp; Poor has <a href="http://rt.com/business/154592-standard-poor-russia-rating/" target="_blank">cut</a> Russia's rating to the lowest investment grade, which Moscow says is ‘politically motivated’ and a reason for the country to establish its <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-rating-agency-own-384/" target="_blank">own ratings system</a>. </p><p> Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia faces ‘<a href="http://rt.com/business/154012-sanctions-russia-stronger-medvedev/" target="_blank">unprecedented</a>’ economic challenges, but that sanctions will make Russia stronger. </p><p> Russian government officials believe the best case scenario for 2014 is <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-0-gdp-ukraine-836/" target="_blank">zero growth</a>. </p><p> The Ukraine crisis has pushed Russia to seek more cooperation with China and Asian neighbors, as well as to boost demand for domestic products. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155824-iraq-election-violence-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[Iraq’s first election since US pullout marked by death over political optimism]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155824-iraq-election-violence-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0b/00/00/2iraq-election-violence-us.jpg" title="Members of Iraq's anti-terrorism force are deployed outside polling stations in central Baghdad on April 29, 2014, one day ahead of Iraq's first general election since US troops withdrew.

(AFP Photo)" /> <p> In the current situation, even a successful attempt to bring people out to vote is no guarantee of quick results. The country is as fragmented politically as it is on the battlefield. Based on recent experience, even if voting demonstrates the success of democracy, a working coalition will take a great deal of time to establish. It took nine months to agree after the last election in 2010. That was when the United States was still around. </p><p> Twenty-two million Iraqis have turned out to elect a 328-seat parliament, with more than 9,000 candidates vying for spots, as the incumbent prime minister of eight years, Nouri al-Maliki will seek a third term. He was among the first to cast his vote today in the Green Zone, where the government is based. Addressing his nation, he was quoted by reporters as saying, <em>“I call upon the Iraqi people to head in large numbers to the ballot boxes to send a message of deterrence and a slap to the face of terrorism.”</em> </p><p> Today, in central Baghdad, security has been ramped up, with voter searches performed before anyone is allowed inside a polling station. Police blocks and barbed wire line the capital’s streets. </p><p> And while the seemingly futile attempts at political order are made, chaos and disorder reign across the country. Voting in parts of the west has been canceled due to increased violence. In Fallujah, Sunni anti-government sentiment is marked by popular calls to rise up, showing just how difficult an inclusive political process is at this time. </p><p> </p><p> Iraq’s security forces have not been successful after months of trying to take areas like the province of Anbar from the clutches of armed extremists. It has become a focal point of Sunni discontent. </p><p> Attacks have been taking place with a steady regularity - especially on electoral officials. Wednesday afternoon saw two roadside bombs go off in the north of the country, killing two staff from the electoral commission, further wounding two security officers, according to an army general. The attack took place to the north-west of the ethnically-mixed city of Kirkuk. Another two electoral stations were attacked with RPGs on the outskirts of Baghdad, as well as one in Mosul, 400km north of the capital - killing one. The total death toll from the Wednesday attacks stands at 11 at the time of publication. </p><p> A string of attacks took 24 lives across the country on Tuesday as well – the worst was a double bombing that killed 17 people in an outdoor market just outside Baghdad, in which most of the victims belonged to the Kurdish minority. </p><p> This follows Monday’s carnage, which claimed a further 50 in a wave of suicide attacks by militants disguised as security force members. Most of these targeted election campaigns. </p><p> 2014 saw the deadliest April since 2008, and 4,000 lives have been lost since the start of this year alone, as the Shia government forces of al-Maliki engage a Sunni opposition. More than 400,000 have been displaced. </p><p> Al-Maliki’s party rose to prominence in 2006, just as violence started to really spiral out of control, with Sunni and Shia militants constantly striking each other’s populations. His party is expected to win the most seats on Wednesday, but is still unlikely to take a majority. </p><p> <em>“Our victory is confirmed,”</em> Reuters quoted him as saying, <em>“but we are still talking about how big this victory will be.”</em> This victory will depend on the PM’s ability to get a coalition together, and given the criticism he has received from nearly all ethnic and political denominations in the country, that is unlikely to happen, even amid an atmosphere of Al-Qaeda-inspired violence by groups like The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which puts him in a unique position to be cast in the role of the defender of Shiites against extremist Sunni elements. </p><p> Despite the elections offering hope of a way forward, <em>“the fear is that it’ll only fan the flames of discontent. The prime minster has been accused of being too authoritarian… of making sectarian divisions worse, instead of better,”</em> RT’s Lucy Kafanov reports. <em>“But the opposition is too fractured to mount a serious challenge.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Since the violence of 2006, and up until 2008, the situation had somewhat calmed down, as the Americans reigned in the Sunni opposition, using their help to fight the more extreme, terrorist elements. But the Sunni-Shia animosity has since come back worse than ever, as Sunni Iraqis are complaining against discrimination by the government. That is aside from the already existing criticism of corruption and failures on all fronts, from infrastructure to health to education and the economy. </p><p> These are not only the first democratic elections since the US military pullout – they’re also the fourth since former leader Saddam Hussein’s ouster in 2003. It is becoming clear to some that any chances of stability, political or otherwise, have actually decreased since the time the start of the American occupation. </p><p> Political scientist, Iraq War veteran and former US Marine Jake Diliberto believes this vote is not an indication of change, but a barely useful attempt to path up a sectarian hole that’s been left by the American occupation. </p><p> <em>“Political elections going on in Iraq is going to bring two possible problems and two possible very good events: the first and biggest problem is sectarian tensions; the other problem is that Al-Qaeda could demonstrate itself as a powerful force by bombing election cycles, putting fear and intimidation into communities,”</em> which could lead many to boycott the elections out of fear, Diliberto believes. </p><p> He sees the continuing spiral of brutality and government powerlessness as arising out of a combination of two things: <em>“because of long-term traditional problems within the sectarian communities and because of the US inability to bring political results post-2003 invasion.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155860-brics-imf-fiscal-rescue/</guid><title><![CDATA[BRICS building parallel IMF]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155860-brics-imf-fiscal-rescue/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0d/40/00/brics-imf-fiscal-rescue.jpg" title="he logo of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the organization's headquarters in Washington, DC (AFP Photo/Saul Loeb)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 10:46:08 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0d/40/00/brics-imf-fiscal-rescue.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The post war consensus on financing bodies appears to be breaking down as the West clings desperately to the reins of the IMF and World Bank. In exasperation, the BRICS nations are pushing forward with alternative institutions.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0d/40/00/brics-imf-fiscal-rescue.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="he logo of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the organization's headquarters in Washington, DC (AFP Photo/Saul Loeb)" /> <p> As arbiter of sound government finance, the IMF was once much feared by profligate politicians. When IMF experts were parachuted in as frontline fiscal rescue, the world clearly recognized a major government economic policy failure. Britain famously reached this nadir in the 1970s, when state spending expansion reached a finite limit and Chancellor Healey was forced into a massive policy U-turn endorsing monetarism and fiscal discipline. </p><p> However, in recent years the IMF has become somewhat politicized, losing track of its original goals. Having been a hugely useful player alongside the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in helping rebuild the New Europe post-Soviet collapse, the IMF of recent years has become a rather odd place: headed by a succession of politicians who seem to regard their role as being a prominent office to canvas for the French Presidency while administering economics-lite. </p><p> Nowadays, the IMF has become rather a haven of discredited Keynesian thinking, aka the endlessly meddling interventionist superstate policies beloved of declining Europe, and indeed Obama's America. Typical of the leaderless zeitgeist overseeing relative economic decline, the political classes have become used to foisting a compromised European political figure into the top job at the IMF. What the IMF really needs are strong technocrats as opposed to the spineless politicians who generally operate with (at the very least!) one eye on their next political position. </p><p> Thus the IMF has gradually become less significant as it has manifestly failed to take the fiscal initiative in recent years. First the world's leading champagne socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn and latterly Christine Lagarde have remained beholden to the flawed policies of big debt and big government which suits the cowardly political mood for kicking economic realpolitik down the road. </p><p> What the IMF ought to be doing is behaving like a good doctor, ensuring the patient takes their medicine and reforms in a fashion which will ensure better health, not simply offering an alcoholic a lower proof of vodka and telling them to keep drinking! During recent European bailout negotiations, IMF minutes suggest the political classes managed to ride roughshod over the IMF in order to maintain the flawed (and still crumbling) euro currency at all costs. In that sense, having a weak European with ambitions for higher political office makes a mockery of the idea that the International Monetary Fund is anything more than an overdraft facility to be rigged in favor of perceived western political interests. No wonder the rising East is disillusioned. </p><p> </p><p> The US and Europe have maintained a stranglehold on the IMF/World Bank C-suite not only in the face of a massive eastern renaissance but also with a certain degree of abject hypocrisy given the abysmal financial management of spendthrift US governments for decades let alone the travesty of recent European economic governance. </p><p> Thus the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), fed up with ongoing American stalling at reforming the voting system in the IMF, have been working their way towards a genuine new world order. Pivoting away from the influence of the US-centric Western financial system, it makes sense to create a counterweight to the IMF; a supranational bank for the emerging east. Naturally, the proof of the venture will be in how it operates. It must maintain sound doctrine that keeps government spending under control and is able to mete out the required ‘tough love’ - the classic toolkit involved debt default and currency devaluation to rebalance economies which have failed - in other words precisely the policies required in an economic failed state like Ukraine. Above all else the BRICS-Monetary Fund needs to mix politically neutral with sufficient government support that it can operate without fear or favor. </p><p> Naturally this is likely to cause it to run up against the IMF for as long as the US and EU insist on making the established supranational financial institutions vehicles for managing decline in the eurozone and elsewhere as opposed to actually imposing policies to repair failure governments and re-establish growth. That will mean strict budgets and creditors taking losses - as opposed to the ludicrous move to corporate socialism in Europe/US post 2008 where bankers speculate with impunity in the expectation of taxpayer redemption if things go sour. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155852-india-election-debate-immolation/</guid><title><![CDATA[Horror show in India as debate spectator self-immolates, grabs politician]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155852-india-election-debate-immolation/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/0c/c0/00/india-election-debate-immolation.jpg" title="Indian bystanders attempt to douse the blaze during an election television debate in in Sultanpur, a town about 160 kilometres from the city of Lucknow.

Our armed forces have been put on full alert,”</em> Turchinov told Wednesday a council of heads of Ukrainian regions in Kiev, as news agencies report. </p><p> He called on the audience to speed up the creation of regional militias loyal to Kiev. <br><br><em>“We must have the capability to move those units fast to support other regions against such a threat,”</em> he stressed. </p><p> Turchinov admitted that Kiev simply cannot get the situation in the rebellious eastern regions under control and reiterated earlier accusations, saying some people in law enforcement <em>“are cooperating with terrorist organizations,”</em> the name Kiev authorities use to refer to anti-government protesters who are seizing government buildings in eastern Ukraine. </p><p> <em>“Our primary task is to prevent the spread of the terrorist threat to other regions of Ukraine,”</em> he said. </p><p> In contradiction to the previous moves of the government, which included raids on protester checkpoints and other demonstrations of force, Turchinov said <em>“as we know from the experience of Maidan, the use of force is inefficient. That’s the situation we faced in the eastern regions.”</em> </p><p> <em><br></em> </p><p> </p><p> Earlier on Tuesday, the acting president said in a televised address that the situation in the east of the country <em>“demonstrated inaction, helplessness and sometimes treason”</em> and pledged to sack many officers in eastern regions of Ukraine. </p><p> Turchinov was elected a new speaker of the parliament and appointed by the MPs to act as the country’s acting president after the previous leader, Viktor Yanukovich, was ousted following violent street protests in February. <br><br> The new authorities in Kiev are failing to deal with a wave of protests against them centered in the Donetsk Region of eastern Ukraine. </p><p> Despite announcing an “anti-terrorist operation” and amassing a large number of troops and heavy weapons in the region, the national government has failed to prevent the continued seizures of buildings there and some other eastern regions of Ukraine. </p><p> There are indications that Kiev does not have enough loyal troops to deliver on its promised protest crackdown. On several occasions the troops sent against activists simply defected, surrendering their weapons and armored vehicles. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155828-debate-us-education-costs-income/</guid><title><![CDATA[The debate debate]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155828-debate-us-education-costs-income/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0b/40/00/222debate-us.jpg" title="Reuters/Jason Reed "/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 08:12:25 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0b/40/00/222debate-us.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />While there is wide agreement that the cost of college education has risen far faster than the incomes of most Americans, there is some debate as to whether the quality of the product has kept pace with the price.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/0b/40/00/222debate-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Jason Reed " /> <p> Not surprisingly, almost all who argue that it has (college administrators, professors, and populist politicians) are deeply invested either ideologically or financially in the system itself. More objective observers see a bureaucratic, inefficient, and hopelessly out of touch ivory tower that is bleeding the country of its savings, and more tragically, its intellectual acuity. </p><p> Nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in the demise of collegiate debate. This once courtly rhetorical sparring ground for class presidents and lawyers-in-training is supposed to be forum for ideas, proofs, and conclusions. And while traditional debates did not typically offer high drama, they did teach students how to produce objectively superior arguments, a skill that many types of potential employers would value. But more recently, debate has succumbed to the worst aspects of moral relativism, academic sloth and politically correct dogma that have transformed it into an unintelligible mix of performance art and petty politics. It's not a debate, but we pretend it is. </p><p> The 2014 National Championship of the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA), one of collegiate debate's governing bodies, made headlines as the first to include two all-African-American finalist teams. The winning team, from Towson University in Maryland, was the first ever comprised solely of African-American women. The results were heralded as a triumph for minority achievement in a field traditionally dominated by white <em>"elites."</em> But this success has come at a great cost: A dramatic change in the rules of the game. The championships, as well as dozens of the CEDA sanctioned debates and championships, are easily found on YouTube. I challenge anyone to watch any of those <em>"debates"</em> and describe the ideas and arguments that participants are supposedly addressing. </p><p> At this year's championship, the actual debate question concerned the wisdom of restricting the war powers of the U.S. president. But instead of addressing one of the most important U.S. foreign policy questions of the past half century, the two teams focused exclusively on how the U.S. was supposedly <em>"at war"</em> with poor black people. Although these arguments were clearly off-subject, it seems that the topic did not matter. The <em>"debate"</em> came off as a mix of rap, personal invective, speed talking, soapbox harangue, and explicative filled rants. When one contestant's time expired, he <em>"brilliantly"</em> yelled <em>"F-ck the time!"</em> As was the case in 2013, when another African American team took the championship, the arguments of the winners completely ignored the stated resolution, and instead used personal experience to challenge the "injustice" of the very notion of debate itself. But subjective arguments have been traditionally dismissed as poor rhetoric. "I won the lottery" is not a good argument in favor of the lottery system. </p><p> But in recent years, logic and objective analysis have come to be considered <em>"white"</em> concepts. In an Atlantic Monthly article (Apr. 16), Osagie Obasogie, a liberal law professor from University of California, is quoted as saying <em>"Various procedures - regardless of whether we're talking about debate formats or law- have the ability to hide the subjective experiences that shape these seemingly 'objective' and 'rational' rules. ...This is the power of racial subordination: making the viewpoint of the dominant group seem like the only true reality."</em> In other words debates, like much in society, was devised by white people to favor white people. This idea, which is the essence of affirmative action, may make professors and students feel good about themselves, but it simply means that minorities have license to underachieve. </p><p> </p><p> Creating an alternate set of rules for people of different backgrounds creates huge problems. What would have happened to Venus and Serena Williams had tennis officials drew up a special set of rules for them to compensate for their background? While they may have won more tournaments, they would not have been pushed to achieve their true potential and their victories would have been empty achievements. While it's true that they faced more obstacles than privileged players from the suburbs, changing the rules to allow for their subjective experiences would have prevented their ultimate success. </p><p> That is exactly what is happening today, not just in debate tournaments, but across universities in general. Excuses are being made and rules are being bent in order to account for our personal differences, race, gender and sexual orientation in particular. This trend is producing a generation of marginally skilled, professionally unprepared graduates. The poor quality of our higher education means that we can't compete with other nations who insist on educating their young people through <em>"objective"</em> and <em>"oppressive"</em> systems. This can also be said of our economy. Dumbed down and subjective criteria allow us to pretend that our economy is growing even as living standards are falling, the labor force is shrinking, savings are evaporating, and opportunity is more and more elusive. Rather than admit the obvious, that we have a remedial economy, we have consistently redefined success downward with revisions to tools we use to measure our economy like GDP, inflation and unemployment. See a deeper analysis of this trend in may latest special report, Taxed By Debt. </p><p> Like with our deteriorating educational system, our economy no longer measures up to previous standards of performance. In education, you can see the difference through comparison to a century old Jr. High School test that I believe would stymie most of today's college graduates. Our economic deterioration can be seen in our high trade deficits, big budget deficits, high public and private debt levels and the explosion in the number of people who rely on government assistance be it in the form of welfare, food stamps, or disability. </p><p> However, according to many economists, none of this is cause for concern as it is simply the way things work in our new <em>"consumer-based," "service-sector,"</em> economy. Instead of growth through savings, capital investment, and production, we now rely on money printing, asset bubbles, leverage, and consumer credit. Inflation, which was once acknowledged as being bad, is now considered good. Persistent trade deficits, once a sign of economic distress, are now considered signs of strong domestic demand. Instead of dealing painfully with intractable problems, we have redefined our liabilities as assets and declared victory. </p><p> In the end, will awarding debate championships to undisciplined, barely comprehensible minority students really help these individuals succeed in life? No law firm or corporation will look to hire debate winners as the competitions have now lost all relevance. Similarly, dumbing down standards to whitewash our poor economy performance will only worsen our problems. Fortunately the Supreme Court last week, with its decision to support Michigan's campaign to end race-based selection practices at state universities, took a tiny step in dismantling this lunacy. But we must be on the lookout for much lower profile aspects of the same confrontation. The front lines are everywhere. </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Peter Schiff <br></span></em> </p><p> <em><span style="color: rgb(79, 97, 40);">Peter Schiff is the CEO and Chief Global Strategist of Euro Pacific Capital, best-selling author and host of syndicated Peter Schiff Show.</span></em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155776-congo-investment-russia-economy/</guid><title><![CDATA[Congo president: Africa needs Russia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155776-congo-investment-russia-economy/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/08/00/00/rtr2ef2y.jpg" title="Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso (Reuters / Hakon Mosvold Larsen / Scanpix)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 07:16:34 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/08/00/00/rtr2ef2y.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The resource-rich West African state of Congo plans to attract infrastructure investment from Russia, President Denis Sassou Nguesso told Russian media.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/08/00/00/rtr2ef2y.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso (Reuters / Hakon Mosvold Larsen / Scanpix)" /> <p> <em>“We plan to develop co-operation in all areas: hydrocarbons, agriculture, minerals, logging and education and training,”</em> he said to RIA Novosti. </p><p> Sassou Nguesso, who first became the leader of his country in 1979, was originally a committed Marxist, and relied on the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. </p><p> He still thanks the USSR <em>“for fighting for the freedom of the people of Africa,”</em> and speaks warmly of the thousands of Congolese who studied and married in the Soviet Union. However, he realizes that the relationship had to be rebuilt anew, following wide-scale political and economic transformations in both countries. </p><p> Sassou Nguesso believes the foundation was laid during an official meeting with Vladimir Putin in November 2012. </p><p> <em>“These extraordinarily important talks allowed us to re-launch our partnership,”</em> he said. <em>“A new stage has started and in the coming month an inter-governmental Russia-Congo commission will meet. As a result of these sessions we hope to establish new concrete aims and projects.”</em> </p><p> The veteran politician, who won his fifth presidential term in 2009 and will be in office until at least 2016, is encouraged at the idea of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) providing an alternative source of support for the continent’s growth, apart from the IMF and the World Bank. </p><p> The five countries recently announced plans to start a development bank that will offer funding for African states. </p><p> Sassou Nguesso, who served two separate terms as the chair of the African Union, two decades apart, speaks warily of <em>“colonialists”</em> and believes that only through closer integration with each other will African powers be able to project a voice onto the world stage. </p><p> <em>“All countries are trying to join large blocs, and Africa, which was divided by outside forces, cannot ignore this process.”</em> </p><p> But for the moment, his focus remains on bringing prosperity to his own country, with a population of 4 million. It endured a devastating civil war in the late 1990s, and is nestled next to the troubled Central African Republic. </p><p> <em>“Our country holds all the cards we need to modernize. Now, me and my countrymen must make sacrifices and make an effort to realize that potential,”</em> said Sassou Nguesso. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155780-kerry-nato-russia-challente/</guid><title><![CDATA[Trans-Atlantic global leadership at stake in Ukraine – Kerry]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155780-kerry-nato-russia-challente/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/08/40/00/kerry-nato-russia-challente.jpg" title="US Secretary of State John Kerry (AFP Photo/Mandel Ngan)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 07:07:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/08/40/00/kerry-nato-russia-challente.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />NATO must return to its original goal of fending off Russia, seizing the chance presented by the Ukrainian crisis to sever Europe from Moscow and move it closer to America, the US secretary of state said. Or else the bloc’s global leadership may be lost.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/08/40/00/kerry-nato-russia-challente.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="US Secretary of State John Kerry (AFP Photo/Mandel Ngan)" /> <p> John Kerry delivered the confrontational call in a speech to the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, DC. He said the stand-off in Ukraine had resulted from a <em>“uniquely personally-driven set of choices”</em> and is <em>“a wake-up call”</em> for NATO. He added that now the military bloc must turn the page on two decades of focusing on expeditionary operations and take a stand against <em>“Putin’s Russia.”</em> </p><p> <em>“After two decades of focusing primarily on our expeditionary missions, the crisis in Ukraine now call us back to the work that this alliance was originally created to perform,”</em> Kerry told the audience. </p><p> NATO’s original purpose was to oppose the Communist Soviet Union, giving the West the military backbone to the ideologically-driven stand-off with the East. Kerry described it as <em>“to defend alliance territory and advance trans-Atlantic security.”</em> </p><p> <em>“Today, Putin’s Russia is playing by a different set of rules,”</em> the secretary stated. <em>“Through its occupation of Crimea and its subsequent destabilization of eastern Ukraine, Russia seeks to change the security landscape of Eastern and Central Europe.”</em> </p><p> <em>“Together we have to push back against those who try to change sovereign border by force. Together we have to support those who simply want to live as we do,”</em> he added. </p><p> </p><p> Kerry didn’t mention NATO’s own operations against Yugoslavia, which helped change sovereign borders in Europe. But he said NATO must not allow the situation continue to develop as it is, because Russia is challenging the position NATO members held since the end of the Cold War. </p><p> <em>“Our entire model of global leadership is at stake. If we stand together, if we draw strength from the example of the past and refuse to be complacent in the present, then I am confident that NATO, the planet’s strongest alliance, can meet the challenges, can absolutely take advantage of the opportunities that are presented by crisis,”</em> he stressed. </p><p> Kerry suggested three points on how trans-Atlantic partners can preserve their leadership and contain Russia. He said all NATO members must comply with alliance’s benchmark of 2 percent GDP defense spending, which is not observed by many European members of the alliance, including European economic powerhouse Germany. </p><p> <em>“Clearly, not all allies are going to meet the NATO benchmark of 2 percent of GDP overnight or even next year,”</em> Kerry said. <em>“But it’s time for allies, who are below that level to make credible commitments to increase their spending on defense over the next five years.”</em> </p><p> NATO members must also help Europe reduce its dependence on Russian energy and develop economic ties with America by speeding down the pipeline the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement, Kerry said. </p><p> The agreement would certainly give more access to European markets to some US corporations, as it would require freeing up European regulations on things like fracking, GMOs, copyright and finance. </p><p> </p><p> Kerry’s policy remarks are in line with those made recently by some other members of the US political establishment. For example Senator John McCain, one of the most vocal critics of Russia, went on the same lines of presenting Russia’s stance on Ukraine a personal choice by President Vladimir Putin and calling for more defense spending in Europe in his speech at Vilnius University, Lithuania, on Wednesday last week. </p><p> <em>“Considering what President Putin is doing right now in Ukraine, it is more important than ever for every NATO ally to spend at least 2 percent of its GDP on defense,”</em> McCain said. <em>“I'm pleased that Lithuania has pledged and is planning to do this, and the sooner you follow through on that commitment the better.”</em> </p><p> The US and Russia have been trading accusations of meddling with Ukrainian crisis lately. Washington says Moscow is sowing dissent in eastern Ukraine, fanning up anti-government protests there. Russia says the US sponsored the February coup in Kiev, which brought into power the current Ukrainian central authorities and has been playing a dominant role in defining the policies of the new government. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155772-ukraine-geneva-agreements-churkin/</guid><title><![CDATA[Kiev did nothing to fulfill Geneva agreements – Russia’s UN envoy]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155772-ukraine-geneva-agreements-churkin/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/c0/00/rtr3g01x.jpg" title="Russian Ambassador to the U.N.

Vitaly Churkin (Reuters / Shannon Stapleton)" /> <p> <em>“Nothing has been done on behalf of Kiev’s authorities to implement the Geneva document. Our Western colleagues, primarily the Americans – who now have an unprecedented influence over Kiev – could not or did not want to convince Kiev to fulfill its obligations under the Geneva agreement,”</em> Churkin said during the UN Security Council meeting in New York on Tuesday. </p><p> Addressing the meeting, US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power accused Russia of stirring up trouble in eastern Ukraine and undermining the government in Kiev. </p><p> “<em>Russia continues to fund, to coordinate, and to fuel the heavily-armed separatist movement,"</em> she said. </p><p> Churkin denied the claims and added that if the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, the West should comprehend its level of responsibility in the matter. </p><p> On April 17, Russia, the US, the EU, and Ukraine <a href="http://rt.com/news/geneva-document-ukraine-deescalation-224/" target="_blank">adopted</a> a joint document on the de-escalation of the Ukraine crisis, calling for all illegal armed groups to lay down arms and for a wide amnesty for detained protesters. </p><p> Churkin stated that none of the radical groups are laying down arms, including the far-right group Right Sector, which is <em>“marching under the Nazi flags.”</em> </p><p> <em>“On the contrary, these groups have been granted legal status, and [have been] used to form the paramilitary battalions 'Dnepr,' 'Slobozhanschina,' and ‘Donbass,'”</em> he said. </p><p> According to Churkin, Kiev’s Independence Square is still being occupied, even though that is in violation of one of the items in the Geneva agreements. <em>“Nobody is vacating anything in Kiev, while Washington is complacently claiming that the buildings are being ‘legally rented out,’”</em> he stated. </p><p> The Russian envoy to the UN also highlighted that repressions against those disagreeing with Kiev’s coup-imposed authorities are continuing, adding that there has been no amnesty for arrested protesters. </p><p> Churkin stated that the current Ukrainian regime, supported by the West, is pushing the country towards a catastrophe. </p><p> He also criticized other states which have claimed that Russia is not doing its part to influence protesters in southeastern Ukraine. <em>“How can you convince the militias in the east of the country to disarm or leave the buildings if they are surrounded, like in Slavyansk, by Ukrainian armed forces and the so-called ‘National Guard’ units, entirely consisting of Right Sector militias?”</em> he said. </p><p> In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday claimed the US has been <a href="http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/" target="_blank">behind</a> the Ukrainian crisis from the beginning, but was initially flying low. He added that if sanctions continue, Russia will have to reconsider who has access to key sectors of its economy. </p><p> <em>“I think what is happening now shows us who really was mastering the process from the beginning. But in the beginning, the United States preferred to remain in the shadow,”</em> Putin said, as quoted by RIA Novosti. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155768-brunei-implements-sharia-law/</guid><title><![CDATA[Brunei adopts Sharia law despite international criticism]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155768-brunei-implements-sharia-law/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/80/00/000_hkg8510073.jpg" title="The Jame' Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque in Bandar Seri Begawan (AFP Photo / Roslan Rahman)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 04:13:16 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/07/80/00/000_hkg8510073.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Brunei is to become the first East Asian country to adopt Sharia law as the sultan confirmed the Islamic penal code on Wednesday.

I place my faith in and am grateful to Allah the almighty to announce that tomorrow, Thursday May 1, 2014, will see the enforcement of Sharia law phase one, to be followed by the other phases</em>," Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said in a speech, AFP reports. </p><p> The implementation of Sharia law would mean that residents will face conviction by Islamic courts for their crimes. Most of the laws will apply to non-Muslims, as well. The first phase, which goes into effect on Thursday, will give offenders fines or jail time for acts ranging from pregnancy outside marriage, propagating other religions, or failure to perform Friday prayers. A second phase will go into effect after a year, punishing those who steal or consume alcohol with whipping and amputations. The final stage will take effect in two years, and will use the death penalty - possibly by stoning - for crimes like adultery, sodomy, or insulting the Koran or the Prophet Mohammed. </p><p> The implementation of the Sharia law sparks concerns over the rights of minorities as about 20 percent of Brunei residents are non-Muslim, most of whom follow Buddhist, Christian, and indigenous belief systems. Chinese make up the largest ethnic minority at 10 percent of the population, while the majority ethnic Malays make up 65 percent. Brunei is also home to 30,000 mostly Roman Catholic Filipino migrant workers and many Western oil workers, according to Reuters. </p><p> </p><p> The United Nations spoke out against the revised penal code. <em>"We are deeply concerned about the revised penal code in Brunei Darussalam, due to come into force later this month, which stipulates the death penalty for numerous offenses,"</em> Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN high commissioner for human rights, <a href="http://rt.com/news/brunei-gay-death-stoning-104/">told reporters</a>. <em>“The application of the death penalty for such a broad range of offenses contravenes international law.”</em> </p><p> Emerlynne Gil, Southeast Asia legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists, told Reuters: <em>"A lot of these provisions and penalties discriminate against women. Stoning to death normally has a huge impact on women because more often than not they are found guilty of these crimes."</em> </p><p> Gay rights organizations in the Asia Pacific have condemned the move to Sharia law. <em>“It may open the floodgates for further human rights violations against women, children, and other people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,”</em> <a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/sideviews/article/bruneis-revised-penal-code-a-cause-of-concern-for-sexual-minorities-isean"> two such groups wrote</a> in a Malaysian Insider op-ed. <em>“Penalty by death sentence contravenes several international human rights laws. Further, death by stoning constitutes torture or other cruel, degrading and inhumane acts of punishment, thus a clear infringement of international humanitarian principles and universal human rights.”</em> </p><p> Indigenous peoples who are not part of the Malay Muslim majority are encouraged to move away from their native languages and cultures, the World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples reported. The government also organizes proselytizing activities and provides financial incentives for converting to Islam. </p><p> But Brunei’s top Islamic scholar denied that Sharia law would lead to extremes in the country. <em>"It is not indiscriminate cutting or stoning or caning,"</em> state media quoted Awang Abdul Aziz as saying after the law was announced. <em>"There are conditions and there are methods that are just and fair."</em> </p><p> Diplomats are taking a wait-and-see approach to the law, saying it remains unclear how the system will work once implemented, as well as how it will coexist with the existing British-based legal system, Reuters reported. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155760-voice-america-reform-support/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Reform bill would require Voice of America to trumpet US policy objectives – report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155760-voice-america-reform-support/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/00/00/rtr1vft.jpg" title="Reuters / Mike Theiler&#10;"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 03:27:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/07/00/00/rtr1vft.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Members of the US House and Senate are working together to craft legislation that would reform US-government-funded broadcasting outlets like Voice of America.

The House bill, supported by Foreign Affairs Committee head Eliot Engel, will get a panel vote on Wednesday. </p><p> Not only does the bill aim to clarify VOA’s mission – which has arguably leaned away from consistently backing the official line in Washington in recent years – but it also reorganizes the federal agency that oversees US-funded media outlets, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). </p><p> BBG will go from having part-time board members leading the organization – US Secretary of State John Kerry is one current <a href="http://www.bbg.gov/about-the-agency/" target="_blank">board</a> member – to a full-time agency official directing daily operations. The bill would also consolidate Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting Network into one <em>“non-federal organization,”</em> Foreign Policy reported. The legislation will also attempt to cut the number of federal contractors that work at the outlets. </p><p> <em>"This legislation makes clear that the Voice of America mission is to support U.S. public diplomacy efforts,"</em> a summary of the new bill outlines. <em>"The VOA charter states that VOA will provide a ‘clear and effective presentation of the policies of the United States...Over time, VOA has abandoned this mission."</em> </p><p> A spokesperson for BBG would not speak on the proposal. <em>"The agency does not comment on pending legislation,"</em> Lynne Weil told Foreign Policy. </p><p> VOA, by far the most widespread of BBG’s networks, produces news and cultural programming in 45 languages and reaches more than 164 million people around the world through television, radio, internet, and mobile platforms. </p><p> It <a href="http://www.insidevoa.com/section/voa_history/2330.html" target="_blank">began</a> as an arm of the Office of War Information in 1942 as a way to match Nazi and Japanese propaganda. The State Department and the US Information Agency took it over in the 1950s, when it turned to counter Communist countries during the Cold War. VOA’s global broadcasts of American jazz music were popular at this time. Major live VOA broadcasts include Martin Luther King Jr.’s <em>“I Have a Dream”</em> address in 1963 and the 1969 moon landing, which 450 million people heard on hundreds of stations worldwide. </p><p> In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed into law VOA’s mission as an <em>"accurate, objective, and comprehensive"</em> news outlet as opposed to an explicit propagandistic venture. </p><p> Since then, <em>“employees at the TV and radio broadcaster have insisted on viewing themselves as objective journalists as opposed to instruments”</em> of the US government’s policies abroad, wrote Foreign Policy. And since, on occasion, VOA has highlighted stories that did not reflect well on the United States, US officials have wondered why hundreds of millions of dollars is spent on a project that does not have a more pro-American outlook. </p><p> News of the reform bill comes days after the Sec. of State Kerry <a href="http://rt.com/news/154760-kerry-attacks-rt-propaganda/" target="_blank">accused</a> RT of being a state-sponsored <em>“propaganda bullhorn”</em> that is <em>“deployed to promote President Putin’s fantasy about what is playing out on the ground”</em> amid unrest in Ukraine. Furthermore, he said RT spends almost all its time <em>“propagandizing and distorting what is happening, or not happening, in Ukraine.”</em> </p><p> Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov <a href="http://rt.com/news/154800-lavrov-kerry-rt-comment/" target="_blank">denounced</a> Kerry’s latest comments about RT as <em>“uncivilized”</em> and <em>“prosecutorial.”</em> </p><p> <em>“[The West] was convinced for some time that it had a full monopoly on mass media,”</em> said Lavrov in a statement. <em>“Russia Today has won a large audience in the US and Western Europe, not to mention in Latin America and the Arab world."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155756-faa-journalist-drone-tornado-investigation/</guid><title><![CDATA[FAA ‘looking into’ $10K fine for drone recording of tornado disaster area]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155756-faa-journalist-drone-tornado-investigation/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/c0/00/screen_shot_2014-04-30_at_04.52.22.jpg" title="A screenshot from a video uploaded on YouTube by Brian Emfinger"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 01:32:47 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://img.rt.com/files/news/26/06/c0/00/screen_shot_2014-04-30_at_04.52.22.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Federal Aviation Administration, already facing criticism from private drone operators, has launched an investigation into drone use in the aftermath of the devastating tornadoes that swept across the southeastern United States.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/c0/00/screen_shot_2014-04-30_at_04.52.22.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A screenshot from a video uploaded on YouTube by Brian Emfinger" /> <p> The <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2014/apr/29/rules-hazy-drone-coverage-tornado-20140429/" target="_blank">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</a> reported Tuesday that the FAA has initiated a probe into the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather aerial footage of the terrible scene in Arkansas, where at least 14 people died over the past few days due to the tornados. One of the worst hit areas was Mayflower, Arkansas, located just 40 minutes away from the state capital of Little Rock, where over a dozen people died. </p><p> Storm chaser and videographer Brian Eminger sought to help the public understand just how bad the disaster was by sending a drone equipped with a video camera over Mayflower just moments after the storms had passed. </p><p> A short video he posted on YouTube, which attracted nearly two million views within just 48 hours, showed emergency crews sifting through rubble where homes and buildings once stood. The images proved that the small Arkansas town was unrecognizable compared to just hours before, with vehicles and large piles of lumber strewn across the highway and elsewhere. </p><p> Eminger’s drone measures approximately 18 inches wide with small propellers that are about eight inches long, he told the Gazette. He used it in the past to help a local TV station obtain footage of a hotel fire in Hot Springs, Arkansas, but could now face a $10,000 fine because of strict FAA guidelines. </p><p> </p><p> The agency’s regulations prohibit UAVs from being used for commercial purposes, including reporting, although photographers and press watchdogs alike have complained that the rule (designed to keep drones out of the flight path of major aircraft) are a violation of the freedom of press guaranteed by the First Amendment. </p><p> Proponents have also complained that frivolous restrictions on drone activity are a needless limit that eliminates a potentially helpful tool for first responders. </p><p> Matt Waite, director of the Drone Journalism Lab for the College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, previously made headlines when his class, which was learning how to use drones for journalistic purposes, received a cease-and-desist letter from the FAA forcing them to continue their instruction inside. The problem, Waite told <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/04/29/faa-looking-into-arkansas-tornado-drone-journalism-raising-first-amendment-questions/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, affects a variety of areas where UAVs could be incredibly useful. </p><p> “<em>We don’t have really clear rules of the road right now for the use of drones for journalists or anyone, really</em>,” he said on Tuesday. “<em>There are a tremendous amount of questions that are floating around out there that have significant ramifications of how journalists will use there, that we do not have solid answers for</em>.” </p><p> When questioned Monday on whether the FAA had seen Eminger’s video, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford told the Gazette that “<em>We are looking into it</em>.” </p><p> If Eminger is nervous about being on the hook for $10,000, though, a March court ruling could provide some relief. The agency previously tried to levy a fine against Raphael Pirker, a videographer whose company 'Team Black Sheep' uses drones to capture unique footage. Pirker convinced Judge Patrick G. Geraghty that “<em>there was no enforceable FAA rule or FAR Regulation, applicable to model aircraft or for classifying model aircraft as an UAS [Unmanned Aircraft System]</em>.” </p><p> The FAA appealed the decision, citing air safety and security. The spokeswoman did not provide any details on when the agency could seek legal action against Eminger. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/c7s2lzDtjew" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155764-controversial-oklahoma-execution-wrong/</guid><title><![CDATA[Oklahoma inmate dies after botched lethal injection, 2nd prisoner granted stay of execution]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155764-controversial-oklahoma-execution-wrong/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/07/40/00/rtr3mijl.jpg" title="Clayton D.

Lockett, 38, was scheduled to be executed at 6pm local time Tuesday with a combination of lethal drugs, details of which were kept secret despite a flurry of court challenges and commentary from Oklahoma lawmakers in the weeks leading up to Lockett’s death. </p><p> Bailey Elise McBride, an Associated Press reporter, was on hand to cover the execution but quickly reported that, while the average execution takes just minutes to complete, media was kept waiting for word for nearly an hour on what happened. </p><p> Prison officials eventually admitted that they had to cancel the execution, which officially began at 6:23pm, because Lockett was still moving at 6:37 and looked up to say, <em>“Something’s wrong.”</em> </p><p> McBride reported that the inmate was <em>“conscious and blinking, licking his lips even after the process began. He then began to seize.”</em> </p><p> Department of Corrections officials said at a press conference immediately following the would-be execution that Lockett had blown a vein and that they are not sure where the drugs went in his body, or how much of the injection his body absorbed. Locket died of a heart attack moments after his convulsion began. </p><p> David Autry, Lockett’s attorney, told assembled media the execution was <em>“botched “</em> and that the state was <em>“bound and determined”</em> to put Lockett to death, adding that the entire proceeding was “extremely difficult” to witness. </p><p> Autry later said Lockett was given <em>“an overdose level”</em> of midazolam, a benzodiazepine usually administered in smaller doses to make patients drowsy. </p><p> Lockett was scheduled to be executed just hours before Charles Warner. Following the incident Tuesday night, the prison director granted Warner a fourteen day stay of execution. <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A botched execution in Oklahoma could be a very big deal for various lethal injection cases across the US.</span> </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> — Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/statuses/461299726940241920">April 30, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> The double execution was supposed to be the end of an arduous legal battle that has lasted for weeks. Representation for both Lockett (convicted in the 1999 kidnapping, rape, and murder of a 19-year-old woman) and Warner (convicted for the 1997 rape and murder of an 11-month-old girl) asserted that each inmate had the right to know which drugs would be included in the cocktail that would be used to kill them. </p><p> The state disagreed, with the matter going all the way up to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision, the high court agreed with the prisoners and noted that the decision would be the <em>“final determination of all issues presently pending before the court.”</em> </p><p> The court, which overturned its own ruling two days later, permitting the executions to go on as originally scheduled, was immediately criticized by Oklahoma politicians. Republican Governor Mary Fallin said that, because the neither inmate contested their guilt, the executions should both occur on Tuesday night. </p><p> <em>“Tonight, in a climate of secrecy and political posturing, Oklahoma intends to kill two death row prisoners using an experimental new drug protocol, including a paralytic, making it impossible to know whether the executions will comport with the Eighth amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual suffering,”</em> Madeline Cohen, Warner’s attorney, said in a press statement Tuesday. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155744-johnson-sterling-all-black-league/</guid><title><![CDATA[Former Knicks' great responds to NBA race scandal with call for black-only league]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155744-johnson-sterling-all-black-league/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/00/00/rtr30i03.jpg" title="Former New York Knicks Larry Johnson (Reuters / Adam Hunger)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 00:48:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/06/00/00/rtr30i03.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />New York Knicks executive and former star Larry Johnson reacted on Twitter to racist and misogynistic remarks made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling by calling for an all African-American basketball league.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/00/00/rtr30i03.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Former New York Knicks Larry Johnson (Reuters / Adam Hunger)" /> <p> Sterling landed in hot water over the weekend, when TMZ released an audio recording believed to be of Sterling telling his mistress V.

The recordings were made by Stiviano herself, according to TMZ. </p><p> <em>"It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people.

(AFP Photo / Khaled Desouki)" /> <p> The statement made by the longest-serving US senator is another complication in Washington’s relationship with Cairo. Since the ouster last year of democratically-elected President Mohammed Morsi by the Egyptian military and allies, the Obama administration has walked a fine line between touting the democratic process while still ultimately maintaining strong allegiances with Egypt, a main ally in the region. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/154336-pentagon-apache-aid-egypt/" target="_blank">Last week</a>, the Pentagon said it would send 10 Apache attack helicopters and $650 million to Egypt’s military regime, which has brutally suppressed dissent among Islamist supporters of Morsi and other groups. The Apaches do not need congressional approval, aides on Capitol Hill said, according to Reuters. </p><p> <em>"I'm not prepared to sign off on the delivery of additional aid for the Egyptian military,"</em> Leahy said from the Senate floor on Tuesday. <em>"I'm not prepared to do that until we see convincing evidence the government is committed to the rule of law."</em> </p><p> An Egyptian court <a href="http://rt.com/news/155284-egypt-court-death-penalty/" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to death 683 supporters of Morsi, forced from office last July, including one of his Muslim Brotherhood movement leaders, Mohamed Badie. </p><p> The new sentences passed on Muslim Brotherhood members came over charges relating to an attack on a police station last August. Some believe the mass sentence is an intimidation tactic to further suppress opposition ahead of the May election, and that the courts will eventually downgrade the execution mandates to life in prison. </p><p> <a href="http://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/-statement-of-senator-patrick-leahy-on-recent-developments-in-egypt-senate-floor" target="_blank">Leahy</a>, chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, called the court ruling part of <em>“a sham trial lasting barely an hour.”</em> </p><p> <em>"It's an appalling abuse of the justice system, which is fundamental to any democracy. Nobody, nobody, can justify this. It does not show democracy. It shows a dictatorship run amok. It is a total violation of human rights,"</em> he said. </p><p> </p><p> Washington usually offers $1.5 billion a year in aid to Egypt, most of it going to the military. Though a humanitarian law, written by Leahy, disallows funding governments that seized power through military coups. </p><p> Whether to call Morsi’s overthrow in July a coup or not flustered the Obama administration, though it eventually cut off aid in October. Morsi was elected in a national vote after the 30-year reign of Hosni Mubarak ended in February 2011 amid popular unrest. </p><p> Obama administration officials have not commented on Leahy’s statements, but said they would discuss the matter with members of Congress, according to Reuters. </p><p> US Secretary of State John Kerry met for an hour on Tuesday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy in Washington, where he made clear the US was <em>“deeply disturbed”</em> by the latest developments in Egypt, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. </p><p> <em>"These actions represent a setback and make it more challenging to move forward,"</em> Psaki said at a department press briefing. She added that the State Department will be in touch with Congress to discuss concerns. </p><p> Elsewhere, the European Union’s foreign policy chief denounced the mass death sentence. </p><p> <em>"These mass trials are clearly in breach of international human rights law,"</em> the EU's Catherine Ashton said in a statement. </p><p> <em>"The exact charges against each defendant remain unclear, the proceedings lack the most basic standards of due process and the verdicts appear grossly disproportionate, failing short of complying with the principle of individual sentencing,"</em> she said. </p><p> Ashton also questioned <em>"the seriousness of Egypt's transition towards democracy."</em> </p><p> <em>"The EU calls on the Egyptian authorities to immediately reverse this trend which jeopardizes any prospects for overcoming divisions within society and to ensure progress towards a truly democratic, stable and prosperous Egypt,"</em> she said. </p><p> On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed dismay over the court’s ruling. </p><p> <em>"Verdicts that clearly appear not to meet basic fair trial standards, particularly those which impose the death penalty, are likely to undermine prospects for long-term stability,”</em> read a statement from the Secretary-General’s office. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155736-online-pirate-extortion-copyright-troll/</guid><title><![CDATA[Judge, siding with accused pirate, orders ‘copyright troll’ to pay up]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155736-online-pirate-extortion-copyright-troll/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/05/80/00/rtx14knk.jpg" title="Reuters / Petar Kujundzic"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 23:15:24 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/05/80/00/rtx14knk.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />High-powered law firms have for decades won massive settlements from accused online pirates based on legal claims that are now in doubt.

Hundreds of suits were successful in reaping millions of dollars for the plaintiffs, until a recent string of rulings in which state and federal judges announced that an IP address alone was insufficient evidence of a defendant’s guilt. </p><p> Defense attorneys representing accused pirates have claimed that, because of the legal grey area, prosecutors sometimes take any measure they can to convince the defendant to settle, rather than leaving the decision up to a judge. </p><p> In early 2010, Dunlap, Grubb and Weaver (DGW) – along with film studio Achte/Neunte and GuardaLey, a German tracking company – began legal proceedings against thousands of internet users suspected of illegally downloading the film “Far Cry,” a little-seen film based on a video game of the same name. </p><p> Just months after the suit was filed, though, one of the alleged pirates named in the suit filed a counter-suit alleging that Dunlap, Grubb and Weaver committed fraud, abuse, extortion, and a number of other offenses because of their role in a “copyright troll” scheme. </p><p> Dmitriy Shirokov first filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of nearly 3,000 people named in the original suit, alleging that DGW was threatening to sue all of those people even though such an effort would be far beyond the relatively small firm’s means. </p><p> “<em>DGW does not genuinely intend to pursue most, if any, of these thousands of claims to trial</em>,” the complaint read, as quoted by <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-lawyers-sued-for-fraud-abuse-and-extortion-101129/" target="_blank">TorrentFreak</a>. “<em>Operating through its alias USCG, DGW advertises its copyright business model to prospective clients in the film industry stating one overriding goal: to ‘obtain settlement’ – not judgments, which would require litigating and proving its allegations</em>.” </p><p> “<em>With only thirteen attorneys on staff, DGW has issued a volume of demand letters that far surpass its ability to litigate this volume of claims case by case</em>,” the filing continued. “<em>USCG tells prospective clients that civil prosecution of copyright claims has not been ‘practical,’ in light of the financial status of individual infringers</em>.” </p><p> The Massachusetts District Court denied the suit’s class-action status last year, severely limiting the financial compensation, although TorrentFreak reported Tuesday that Judge George O’Toole ordered DGW to pay $39,909.95 (including attorney fees). The decision comes after three years of claims that DGW was unable to find the necessary evidence indicating that they were not trying to extort suspected pirates, that the company’s computer system had crashed, and other stall tactics. </p><p> “<em>The case did accomplish what we wanted it to</em>,” Jason Sweet, Shirkov’s attorney, told <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/accused-downloader-wins-case-copyright-trolls-140429/" target="_blank">TorrentFreak</a>. “<em>That is, to deter others from starting similar cases in Massachusetts. It served its purpose</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155748-rally-kiev-massive-fight/</guid><title><![CDATA[Far-right rally turns into massive brawl on Kiev’s Maidan, shots heard (PHOTOS)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155748-rally-kiev-massive-fight/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/06/40/00/000_par7866565.jpg" title="Pro-Kiev activists clash with ultra-nationalists activists in their attempt to stop them to march through the Independence Square in Kiev on April 29, 2014.

The marchers came to commemorate those killed during anti-government protests in December-February. </p><p> </p><p> Maidan self-defense units blocked the rally at the barricades across from the main post office, prompting a massive fight. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3-vOWogFXnU" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="420"></iframe> </p><p> The far-right radicals reportedly used firecrackers, traumatic guns, and tear gas.

Though the siege ended quickly, the crucial vote to replace Premier Abdullah Al-Thinni was postponed until next week. </p><p> Hmeidan said the gunmen were associated with one of the defeated prime minister candidates, though he did not name which failed candidate it was, Reuters reported. </p><p> Parliament deputies were to hold a final vote to replace Thinni before the interruption. Thinni resigned two weeks ago after he claimed gunmen had targeted his family. </p><p> Thinni was the successor to Ali Zeidan, who was tossed from office by deputies after rebels in the east had <a href="http://rt.com/news/libya-oil-blockade-rebels-697/" target="_blank">maintained</a> a months-long blockade of oil export ports, attempting to sell oil independently. </p><p> The prior vote resulted in a win for businessman Ahmed Maiteeq over six other candidates. Maiteeq was to face runner-up Omar Al-Hasi in the second and final vote before the parliament raid. </p><p> Three years after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi, the weak Libyan government has been unable to control rebel factions, Islamists, and territorial rivals that have refused to disarm or abandon their regional fiefdoms. Militias often attack the interim General National Congress (GNC) to make political or financial demands, according to Reuters. </p><p> The divides in the GNC assembly mirror the diversity of groups on the ground. Deadlock reigns among Islamists, tribal leaders, and nationalists, all as the struggling army attempts to maintain order against fighters, Islamic militants, and tribal groups. </p><p> Libyans, angry at the slow pace of change, pushed parliament in February to agree to early elections. Deputies had agreed to extend their terms past the February 7 mandate to allow a special committee to draft a new constitution. The move provoked protests among the population, as the citizenry largely blames congress for the lack of progress in the post-Gaddafi transition. </p><p> Meanwhile, assembly president Nouri Abu Sahmain is under investigation for a leaked video of him being questioned about a late-night visit in January by two women at his house, according to Benghazi MP Ahmed Langhi. </p><p> Abu Sahmain is a powerful army commander who disappeared from the public eye in March when the attorney general began the probe. Rumors have it that he was briefly detained by a militia to question him about the women, but he denies he was ever kidnapped. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155684-india-foreign-policy-elections/</guid><title><![CDATA[Modi Doctrine: Elixir of Indian foreign policy]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155684-india-foreign-policy-elections/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/02/40/00/india-election.jpg" title="Indian women queueing to cast their votes in Alwar, Rajasthan on April 24, 2014 .

(AFP Photo / Files / Prakash Singh) " /> <p> Strategic elites in India and international observers are reading the tea leaves to decipher the likely path that one of the most important emerging powers will take in the world for the next five years. </p><p> Expectation that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), under Mr. Narendra Modi has the best chance of taking power after results are declared on May 16, is piquing interest about the likely changes in foreign policy that India might adopt. In light of this imminent turnover of power in New Delhi, it is pertinent to elaborate the principal challenges facing contemporary Indian foreign policy. </p><p> The foremost problem is the question of identity and self-definition. How does India view itself in world affairs? Is it a wannabe great power or, as Amitabh Mattoo of the University of Melbourne puts it, a “reluctant superpower” hesitant to assert itself on the global stage? Is India a leader of the Global South or has it abandoned the causes that win followers among fellow developing countries? Is it satisfied being a hegemon of South Asia or does it have broader ambitions of exerting influence in the rest of Asia and beyond? </p><p> The current government and its predecessors did not dwell on ‘who are we?’ kind of lines. This neglect left a void in defining India’s core national interests and imbuing them with a deeper purpose. Thanks to confusion about India’s international identity, long-term policy planning and scenarios about the state of the world to formulate grand strategy for the year 2020 and beyond have been missing altogether in the largely ad hoc universe of Indian foreign policy. If Mr. Modi becomes Prime Minister, he would be wise to invest his brains trust with these crucial tasks. </p><p> The second problem dogging Indian foreign policy is the question of strategy. Is India engaged in counterbalancing China or the United States, the respective number two and number one powers in the world? Should India bandwagon with the US in order to ward off the immediate strategic threat posed by the Chinese neighbor, or is India also intent on remaking the wider global order by checking American power through forums like BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)? </p><p> </p><h2> Indian pole </h2><p> Recent unofficial doctrines such as the ‘Nonalignment 2.0’ strategy advocate equidistance from both China and the US. But does India also have the wherewithal to build itself up as an independent third power center in world politics, with its own group of adherent nations and its own brand of, say a ‘Mumbai Consensus’, that is distinct from the Western Washington consensus or the so-called ‘Beijing Consensus’? </p><p> While placing faith in speeding up economic growth as the ultimate guarantor of a more powerful India, the next government in New Delhi should simultaneously develop a vision document aiming at multipolarity, in which India is a pole in its own right rather than a mere pendulum swinging in an à la carte basis on issue to issue between China and the US. </p><p> Should Mr. Modi become the Prime Minister, he must demand accountability from the US for its massive cybersurveillance over private and governmental communications in India. The previous government under Dr. Manmohan Singh was too meek on a grave threat posed to Indian national security by the US National Security Agency’s intrusive snooping. It rightly condemned American abuse of a female Indian diplomat, but left the bigger issue of mistrust generated by the NSA’s hacking unaddressed. Washington took India for granted due to the non-assertive approach of Dr. Manmohan Singh, who had a strange affection for America beyond what was warranted from the head of government of an aspiring great power. </p><p> Setting the limits and red lines beyond which India will not tolerate great power meddling, and devising ways to concretely counter threats from more powerful states, will be the litmus tests for the gutsiness and toughness which the </p><p> BJP and Mr. Modi tout as cornerstones of their approach to national security and foreign policy. </p><p> </p><h2> ‘Big picture’ </h2><p> The third problem in the conduct of Indian foreign policy is the question of capacity and political will. The next central government has to reverse the pathetic trend of understaffing and under-equipping India’s career foreign service corps. Political will from the top, i.e. the Prime Minister’s office, to invest in a more expansive and global foreign policy will be required to overcome parochial navel gazing and complacency. </p><p> Although India cannot match the fat checkbook diplomacy of China around the world, there are more creative means for the former to be involved in solving global security and economic crises. Overcautious and reactive thinking, which are hallmarks of India’s foreign policy in recent decades, must be replaced with a more proactive and engaged ‘big picture’ diplomacy that aims to reorder global institutions and democratize them. </p><p> In distant parts of the world, India has thus far followed only economic interests without displaying any stake in resolving regional conflicts and security dilemmas. New Delhi needs to step up to the plate where India’s MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) is presently MIA (Missing in Action). </p><p> Mr. Modi will also perform a profound national service by paying greater attention to the military in shaping India’s national security doctrines and postures. The abysmal allocation of an average of less than 2 percent of GDP to defense in recent times is a retrograde policy which India should be jettisoning under the new government if it has to send a signal of its will to raise its material capabilities. Military diplomacy should also become integral to foreign policy making, something that all great powers past and present have done without exception. </p><p> The other constituency which Mr. Modi should rope into foreign policymaking is India Incorporated. Previous governments have failed to harness the full potential of the Indian private sector as a force multiplier that brings rich foreign policy dividends. Mr. Modi’s image as a corporate-friendly politician is an asset that can give jet propulsion to India’s commercial diplomacy and stoke the “interlocking relationships” that the BJP has vowed to nurture in its election manifesto. </p><p> </p><h2> Beneficiary position </h2><p> Two big constraints have stunted India’s foreign policy dreams, viz. its dependence on imports for energy security and military hardware. Overcoming these deficits through time-bound energy and defense indigenization blueprints will yield phenomenal benefits for India’s much-desired ‘strategic autonomy.’ Mr. Modi’s reputation for result-oriented governance in the domestic sphere must also translate into a hard-charging foreign policy if he takes charge after May 16. </p><p> The next five years will be seminal for the global power transition that is underway between West and East and between Global North and Global South. India is poised to be a beneficiary because the tailwinds of this transition are with Asian powers. But it takes extraordinary leadership in foreign policy and a master plan for India to ride the crest and take its due place as a great power. The vehicle of the state has an accelerator which needs a firm foot to be pushed and a strategically astute driver behind the steering wheel. Mr. Modi can enter the league of foreign policy statesmen only if he can satisfy these criteria. </p><p> The last time an Indian Prime Minister was associated with a systematic set of ideas, principles and well-honed means to guide foreign policy was in the 1970s and early 1980s, when the ‘Indira Doctrine’ of Mrs. Indira Gandhi was enunciated. In 1997-’98, there was an abortive ‘Gujral Doctrine’ named after the short-lived prime ministership of Mr. Inder Kumar Gujral, but it hardly had any lasting impact. In the absence of doctrines, Indian foreign policy is a saga of improvisation and unpredictability that does not behoove a major power. </p><p> Mr. Modi is on the cusp of what pollsters predict as a certain victory in the general elections happening right now in phases across India. The BJP’s projection of him as a strongman, who is the answer to the anxieties and frustrations of India’s people, has drawn a comparison by veteran Indian journalist Mr. Dileep Padgaonkar in The Times of India to the images of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Interestingly, all these three international figures have patented a hard-nosed foreign policy style and substance that has forced the world to sit up and pay serious attention to their respective claims and interests. </p><p> If Indian voters entrust the keys of the nation to Mr. Modi, a ‘Modi Doctrine’ in foreign policy should ensure that the next five years do not go down as a lost phase when the country could not grasp its historic international opportunity. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155724-crimea-water-supply-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Moscow will not bargain with Kiev over Crimea's water supply – Russian resources minister]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155724-crimea-water-supply-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/04/c0/00/000_dv1713735.jpg" title="A picture taken in the Crimea's Kirovsky region on April 27, 2014, shows a man pomping out water from the nearly empty Northern Crimean Canal, which supplies the peninsula's water.

(AFP Photo / Yuriy Lashov)" /> <p> <em>“The situation clearly shows that Kiev is unfriendly towards the people of Crimea. We’re not surprised by this as recent developments characterize the regime in Kiev as anti-popular,”</em> Donskoy said, as quoted by Itar-Tass news agency. <br><br> Moscow will not take part in political bargaining because <em>“it’s the ordinary people who suffer” f</em>rom water shortages, the minister said as he arrived in the city of Sevastopol. <br><br> Donskoy stressed that Crimea's agricultural industry is most affected in the current situation, but added that <em>“we’ll find ways to compensate the water demands.”</em> <br><br><em>“In Crimea, a lot of water is wasted. It’s dumped into the sea. There’s no water recycling in place, which would enable us to use water for technical needs after preliminary processing,”</em> he said. <br><br> The minister added that Crimea's water supply system is in rather bad shape after decades of Ukrainian rule. <br><em><br> “Today we examined the Feodosiya reservoir where over 70 percent of the water is unusable,”</em> he explained. <br><br> According to the minister, the water supply system in Crimea will be modernized by the Russian government, taking into account the specific features of each region of the peninsula. <br><br> He added that groundwater reserves will help satisfy Crimea's needs. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“But we must use all available options,”</em> the minister said, underlining the importance of reconstructing the existing facilities. Donskoy said this will be less expensive than erecting large desalination plants for sea water, which he called <em>“the last option to be considered.”</em> <br><br> On Saturday, the coup-imposed Kiev government cut off water supply through the North-Crimean Channel, which delivers water from the Dnieper River to Crimea. <br><br> Crimea’s Prime Minister Sergey Aksenov was quick to state that <em>“there are no problems with drinking water. Agricultural producers will be compensated for their losses.”</em> <br><br> Crimea, which is dependent on Ukraine for 85 percent of its freshwater, offered an advance payment for the water from the Dnieper River. However, the talks were sabotaged by Kiev. <br><br> The relevant documents were sent to Ukraine's water management agency on five occasions, but were returned as <em>“far-fetched”</em> excuses, Vitaly Nakhlupin, head of the Permanent Economic Committee of the Crimean Parliament, said. <br><br> The ultranationalist coup in Kiev prompted the Crimean peninsula – home to an ethnic Russian majority – to hold a referendum on its future within Ukraine. <br><br> On March 16, over 96 percent of Crimean voters decided to cut ties with Kiev and rejoin Russia. <br><br> Crimea and the city of Sevastopol were officially accepted into the Russian Federation on March 21, with President Vladimir Putin signing a decree confirming the territories as part of Russia. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155660-kerry-israel-apartheid-comment/</guid><title><![CDATA[Kerry backtracks on Israel ‘apartheid’ remark, wishes he ‘chose a different word’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155660-kerry-israel-apartheid-comment/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/00/c0/00/kerry.jpg" title="U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (Reuters / Denis Balibouse) "/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 20:25:33 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/00/c0/00/kerry.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />US Secretary of State John Kerry has backtracked on suggestions that Israel could become an “apartheid state,” saying that he wishes he had formulated his sentences differently.

Because a unitary state winds up either being an apartheid state with second-class citizens – or it ends up being a state that destroys the capacity of Israel to be a Jewish state.”</em> </p><p> <br><em>“Once you put that frame in your mind, that reality, which is the bottom line, you understand how imperative it is to get to the two-state solution, which both leaders, even yesterday, said they remain deeply committed to.”</em> <br><br> Political analysts were quick to point out that, despite the term <em>“apartheid state”</em> being freely kicked around in other circles, it was the first time that a US statesman of Kerry’s caliber was known to have uttered the term. <br><br> Whether the comment was deliberately planned, or a slip of the tongue, Kerry quickly retreated from his Monday comment in his Tuesday statement. <br><br><em>“I have been around long enough to also know the power of words to create a misimpression, even when unintentional, and if I could rewind the tape, I would have chosen a different word,”</em> he said. <br><br> The comment is already being used by Republicans hoping for a political advantage ahead of November's midterm elections. <br><br><em>“Reports that Secretary Kerry has suggested Israel is becoming an apartheid state are extremely disappointing,”</em> House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who is Jewish, said. <em>“The use of the word apartheid has routinely been dismissed as both offensive and inaccurate, and Secretary Kerry's use of it makes peace even harder to achieve.”</em> <br><br> Kerry’s statements fell at the eleventh hour of the latest Middle East peace talks, which are scheduled to end Tuesday after a frenetic nine months which saw the Secretary of State shuttling back and forth between Washington and Israel, hoping to give the Palestinians what the international community gave to Israel in 1948: statehood. <br><br> To date, peace talks have not resulted in any solution. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155688-saudi-human-rights-norway/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Saudi Arabia slams Norway’s human rights record]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155688-saudi-human-rights-norway/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/02/80/00/saudi-arabia.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Fayez Nureldine"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 20:25:07 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/02/80/00/saudi-arabia.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Norway’s human rights record has been dragged up for harsh criticism by...Saudi Arabia.

During the review, all UN members are closely scrutinized by the other constituent states of the body. <br><br> Brende noted the irony of Saudi Arabia lambasting a country for its human rights record to Norway’s NTB wire agency. <br><br><em>“It is a paradox that countries which do not support fundamental human rights have influence on the council, but that is the United Nations,”</em> Brende stated, hinting at the absence of a spotless human rights record in the countries doing the finger pointing. <br><br> Rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) have been extremely vocal in their demands this year that Saudi Arabia soften its clampdown on human rights activists in the country. HRW stated in February that the country is citing <em>“terrorism”</em> in order to ignore due process through the Penal Law for Crimes of Terrorism and its Financing. <br><br> In January, HRW called Washington's silence on Saudi Arabia's rights record <em>“deafening.”</em> Amnesty International has also called this month for Saudi Arabia to release prominent human rights activist and lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair, who was arrested in relation to his human rights work. <br><br> The latest HRW report stated that in 2012, the country had <em>“stepped up arrests and trials of peaceful dissidents, and responded with force to demonstrations by citizens.”</em> <br><br><em>"Authorities continue to suppress or fail to protect the rights of nine million Saudi women and girls and nine million foreign workers.” <br></em> <br> It added: <em>“As in past years, thousands of people have received unfair trials or been subject to arbitrary detention. The year has seen trials against half-a-dozen human rights defenders and several others for their peaceful expression or assembly demanding political and human rights reforms.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155720-obama-approval-lowest-of-term/</guid><title><![CDATA[Obama’s approval rating lowest-ever, months before midterm elections]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155720-obama-approval-lowest-of-term/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/04/80/00/000_hkg9758592.jpg" title="US President Barack Obama (AFP Photo / Jim Watson)"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 20:23:52 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/04/80/00/000_hkg9758592.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />President Barack Obama’s approval ratings have hit another low, dropping to 41 percent.

The numbers were even more grim when respondents were asked about the situation in Russia and Ukraine and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare). When it came to Russia, Obama received a 34 percent approval rate, with 46 disapproving. For health care, 37 percent approved, while 57 percent disapproved. The survey was taken April 9-13. </p><p> Peter Grier, the Washington editor for the Christian Science Monitor, warns that presidential approval ratings in the low 40s signals <em>“a danger zone for the Democratic Party.”</em> </p><p> Conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin echoed that sentiment. </p><p> <em>“Politics today resembles the second term of President George W. Bush. The country stopped listening to him; the voters had decided they had had it,”</em> Rubin writes in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/04/29/obamas-approval-is-collapsing-and-hes-taking-dems-with-him/"> Washington Post column</a>. <em>“Both he and his party suffered in polls in the last midterm election of his presidency.”</em> </p><p> And the Democrats are suffering. A majority of participants (53 percent) said that it was more important to have Republicans in charge of Congress, to act as a check on Obama’s policies. Nearly two-thirds of respondents say they plan to look around at other candidates, rather than the incumbent. Congressional Republicans also rated better than the president when it came to finding the balance between cutting unneeded government spending versus continuing necessary government spending, with 45 percent siding with Republicans in Congress and 38 percent choosing Obama. </p><p> Sean Trende at RealClearPolitics <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/01/22/how_obamas_job_approval_could_sway_senate_races.html"> wrote in January</a> that there is a statistically significant relationship between Obama’s job approval and Democratic votes in Senate elections. <em>“With the movement of the president’s job approval numbers into the low 40s, the Democrats’ Senate odds would deteriorate considerably,”</em> he said. </p><p> <em>“If the president’s job approval is still around 43 percent in November -- lower than it was on Election Day in 2010 -- the question would probably not be whether the Democrats will hold the Senate, but whether Republicans can win 54 or 55 seats,”</em> Trende wrote. <em>“Given the numbers… that should not be unthinkable.”</em> </p><p> Despite the gloomy election outlook for Dems, more respondents - 45 percent - said they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their congressional district, to 44 percent who plan to vote for the GOP candidate. And voters still trust them more than Republicans overall (40-34, with 17 percent responding neither). The Democrats also have voter trust on several key issues: health care (43-35), immigration (40-34) and abortion (43-35). </p><p> Republicans got slammed on several issues: helping the middle class (52-32), women’s issues (55-25), gay marriage (45-31), minimum wage (47-29). The Republicans had a higher level of trust on the federal budget deficit (44-35) and gun control (44-39). With a 3.5-point margin of error, the two parties were in a statistical tie on the economy. </p><p> As the deadline for enrolling in Obamacare <a href="http://rt.com/usa/americans-confused-obamacare-enrollment-684/">was extended</a> and finally arrived on March 31, the poll showed the overall popularity of the program has declined from 49 percent to 44 percent this month. Half the respondents believed the implementation was worse than expected, compared to the 41 percent who saw the implementation going better than expected. <br> Business Insider points out that Obamacare approval ratings fell, despite the fact that enrollment exceeded its original targets, with more than 8 million people enrolling through health-care exchanges created by the ACA. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155728-hezbollah-cyprus-us-talks/</guid><title><![CDATA[US in secret talks with Hezbollah – Israeli reports]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155728-hezbollah-cyprus-us-talks/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/05/00/00/000_nic6271576.jpg" title="An image grab taken from Hezbollah's al-Manar TV on December 3, 2013 shows Hassan Nasrallah, chief of Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah movement (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 20:18:52 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/05/00/00/000_nic6271576.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Sources in Washington, DC have told reporters at Israel’s DEBKAfile that secret discussions involving the White House and Hezbollah have recently taken place in the island nation of Cyprus.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/05/00/00/000_nic6271576.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="An image grab taken from Hezbollah's al-Manar TV on December 3, 2013 shows Hassan Nasrallah, chief of Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah movement (AFP Photo)" /> <p> According to the news site’s unnamed sources, officials working within the administration of United States President Barack Obama have reached out to members of the militant Lebanese group that’s designated as a terrorist organization by the US — unbeknownst to the media until the site published <a href="http://www.debka.com/article/23876/Secret-US-Hizballah-talks-Washington-plans-to-include-Lebanon-Syria-deals-in-Iran-nuclear-pact-" target="_blank">reports</a> of the meeting on Tuesday this week. </p><p> Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, DEBKAfile reported, considers himself to be a key figure with regards to potentially resolving the bloody civil war in Syria that has pitted President Bashar Al-Assad’s regime against anti-government rebels for three years now. </p><p> The actions of Hezbollah, DEBKAfile said, are “<em>credited with turning the Syrian army’s fortunes around from near defeat in 2013 to partial triumph in key areas of Syria this year</em>. “ </p><p> “<em>Nasrallah is able to boast that his movement’s commitment to the Syrian conflict is its central mission and will remain so until rebel and Al-Qaeda forces are finally vanquished</em>,” the site reported. </p><p> As a result, DEBKAfile reported on Tuesday this week that the Obama administration has begun participation in secret talks with Nasrallah’s team recently in order to put an end to not just the war in Syria, but also to ease tensions between the US and Iran. </p><p> According to DEBKAfile, agents with the US Central Intelligence Agency met in Cyprus last month with intelligence and security operatives from Hezbollah in an attempt to resolve at least a portion of the hostilities that has plagued the Middle East in recent years. </p><p> Both meetings, the site claimed, were led on the American side by the US Ambassador to Beirut, David Hale. Lebanese media reported that Hale held discussions with Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea, who has opposed any agreement between the state’s official government and Hezbollah. </p><p> <em>“In Washington’s view, Hezbollah’s involvement in the Syrian war has increased its leader’s dependence on Tehran,”</em> the article reads. Nasrallah <em>“accordingly has little room for maneuver in contacts with US representatives, and if he turns difficult, they are sure they can turn to Tehran to force him in line.”</em> </p><p> <em>“The plan developed in Washington was to seize the momentum of the nuclear track and ride it to a broad US-Iranian understanding that embraces a comprehensive nuclear accord with Tehran as well as understandings for resolving the Syrian and Lebanese questions,”</em> DEBKA reported </p><p> If accurate, then one of Hezbollah’s top dogs could help end tensions in both Syria and Iran with regards to America’s involvement on both fronts. At the same time, however, US Ambassador Hale was reported by the Arabic magazine <a href="http://www.majalla.com/eng/2014/04/article55249734" target="_blank">Majalla</a> to be endorsing lawmaker Michel Aoun for president of Lebanon, where elections will soon be held. If the US representative is successful in distancing Aoun from the Hezbollah officials he’s current affiliated with, Majalla wrote, then Hezbollah could become isolated and forced to reconsider its role in the Syrian war — the creation of such a rift, however, may in the meantime hurt the odds of a deal between Nasrallah and Americans. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/</guid><title><![CDATA[Putin: Washington behind Ukraine events all along, though flying low]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/05/40/00/000_dv1714390.jpg" title="Russia's President Vladimir Putin attends a session of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in Minsk, on April 29, 2014.

(AFP Photo / Alexey Druzhinin)" /> <p> <em>“I think what is happening now shows us who really was mastering the process from the beginning. But in the beginning, the United States preferred to remain in the shadow,”</em> Putin said, as quoted by RIA Novosti. </p><p> Putin stated that since the US has taken a lead role in resolving the political crisis in Ukraine, it is <em>“telling that they originally were behind this process, but now they just have emerged as leaders”</em> of it. </p><p> The <em>"Maidan cookies"</em> policy paves the way to a broader crisis, Putin warned, referring to US officials showing up in central Kiev and encouraging protesters during demonstrations. </p><p> <em>“It is necessary to understand that the situation is serious and try to find serious approaches to the solution,”</em> he said. </p><p> Putin said that he has called on Kiev to start an all-Ukrainian dialogue, adding that other countries should not be blamed for the crisis. </p><p> <em>“[They should] treat equally the rights of those living in other areas of Ukraine, first of all, I mean, the east and southeast, establish a dialogue, find a compromise,"</em> he told journalists while speaking about the measures necessary to put an end to the crisis. <em>“Here's what you need to do; searching for the guilty outside Ukraine is wrong.”</em> </p><h2> Russia may reconsider foreign access to energy sector </h2><p> Regarding the last row of sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and the EU, Vladimir Putin said he sees no need for counter sanctions. </p><p> <em>"We would very much wish not to resort to any measures in response,"</em> he told reporters. <em>"But if something like that continues, we will of course have to think about who is working in the key sectors of the Russian economy, including the energy sector, and how.”</em> </p><p> Certain US companies have close business ties to Russia, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp. </p><p> For example, Exxon Mobil's net acreage holdings in Sakhalin, Russia were about 85,000 acres at the end of 2013, while its net acreage in the Rosneft joint venture for the Kara and Black Seas was 11.3 million acres. </p><p> Chevron Corp has a 15 percent stake in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which transports crude oil from Kazakhstan through Russia to the Black Sea. </p><p> On Monday, the US implemented its latest round of <a href="http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/" target="_blank">sanctions</a> against Russia, targeting business leaders and companies with ties to Putin. </p><p> <em>"Regarding the second package, it's not clear at all what this is linked to, because there is no cause and effect link with what is happening now in Ukraine and Russia,"</em> Putin said. </p><p> At the same time, the US and EU sanctions will not harm the Eurasian integration process, which is meant to lead to the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union, based on a Customs Union and common economic space among Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, he said. </p><p> Putin also commented on <a href="http://rt.com/news/154948-eastern-ukraine-osce-detained/" target="_blank">observers</a> from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) being detained in eastern Ukraine, stating that he is confident that the situation will be resolved, but stressing that all parties involved must draw conclusions. </p><p> <em>“All the participants in this process will have to draw conclusions from this, from this situation. And from now on avoid such mistakes,”</em> he said. </p><p> Putin noted that he understands the concerns of European partners and added that Ukrainian authorities should have discussed and received approval for the visit from local authorities in eastern Ukraine in order to avoid such a situation. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155712-martens-policies-deaths-jpmorgan/</guid><title><![CDATA[Insurance policies pertaining to bankers’ suicides classified as containing ‘trade secrets’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155712-martens-policies-deaths-jpmorgan/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/04/00/00/000_141311987.jpg" title="AFP Photo / John Moore"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 19:09:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/04/00/00/000_141311987.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />After a recent rash of mysterious apparent suicides shook the financial world, researchers are scrambling to find answers about what really is the reason behind these multiple deaths. Some observers have now come to a rather shocking conclusion.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/04/00/00/000_141311987.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / John Moore" /> <p> Wall Street on Parade bloggers Pam and Russ Martens <a href="http://wallstreetonparade.com/2014/04/suspicious-deaths-of-bankers-are-now-classified-as-%E2%80%9Ctrade-secrets%E2%80%9D-by-federal-regulator/" target="_blank">wrote</a> this week that something seems awry regarding the bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies held by JPMorgan Chase. Traditional life insurance policies ensure that the loved ones of the deceased are compensated fairly in the event of a death, but banks are investing billions in policies that let them receive untaxed payment with the passing of each employee. While it’s not unusual for major banks to take out policies that compensate companies in the event of an employee death, the Martens wrote, attempts to find out more about that practice have been peculiarly hard and have raised a red flag among bloggers like those at Wall Street on Parade. </p><p> Four of the biggest banks on Wall Street combined hold over $680 billion in BOLI policies, the bloggers reported, but JPMorgan held around $17.9 billion in BOLI assets at the end of last year to Citigroup’s comparably meager $8.8 billion. </p><p> Both banks are global financial institutions with commercial and investment banking operations, the Martens wrote, and each employs close to a quarter-of-a-million employees. Nevertheless, they say that JPMorgan has experienced a far greater rate of suicide among employees in recent months, particularly in the midst of a series of news reports documenting unusual leaps off buildings and other bizarre deaths that have taken the lives of JPMorgan staffers. </p><p> <em>“Wall Street on Parade carefully researched public death announcements over the past 12 months which named the decedent as a current or former employee of Citigroup or its commercial banking unit, Citibank,”</em> the Martens wrote on Tuesday. <em>“We found no data suggesting Citigroup was experiencing the same rash of deaths of young men in their 30s as JPMorgan Chase. Nor did we discover any press reports of leaps from buildings among Citigroup’s workers.”</em> </p><p> Shocked by the comparably greater amount of BOLI assets held by JPMorgan as opposed to Citibank, the Martens wrote that they filed a Freedom of Information Act request to see if more could be revealed about the life insurance policies being bought in the billions. This week, the bloggers said they struck an unusual roadblock. </p><p> The March 21 letter from Wall Street on Parade to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency asked for the agency to provide: </p><p> <em>“The number of deaths from 2008 through March 21, 2014 on which JPMorgan Chase collected death benefits; the total face amount of BOLI life insurance in force at JPMorgan; the total number of former and current employees of JPMorgan Chase who are insured under these policies; any peer studies showing the same data comparing JPMorgan Chase with Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup.”</em> </p><p> Last week, however, the OCC replied with a response that made the Martens even more curious. This week, the Martens published the April 18-dated response that acknowledges documents relevant to their request are being withheld because the files are “<em>privileged or contains trade secrets, or commercial or financial information, furnished in confidence, that relates to the business, personal or financial affairs of any person</em>,” and “<em>related to an examination, operating or condition report prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of the OCC or any other agency responsible for regulating or supervising financial institutions</em>.” </p><p> “<em>The ironic reality is that the documents do not pertain to the personal financial affairs of individuals who have a privacy right</em>,” the Marten blogged back. “<em>Individuals are not going to receive the proceeds of this life insurance for the most part. In many cases, they do not even know that multi-million dollar policies that pay upon their death have been taken out by their employer or former employer</em>.” </p><p> “<em>Equally important, JPMorgan is a publicly traded company whose shareholders have a right under securities laws to understand the quality of its earnings – are those earnings coming from traditional banking and investment banking operations or is this ghoulish practice of profiting from the death of workers now a major contributor to profits on Wall Street</em>?” the bloggers asked. </p><p> As RT <a href="http://rt.com/usa/twelfth-banker-suicide-finicial-world-634/" target="_blank">reported</a> last month, 28-year-old Kenneth Bellando of New York City became the twelfth person in the banking sector this year to commit suicide. Among those dozen casualties are no fewer than six people — including Bellando — who worked at JPMorgan either during or before the time of their death. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
