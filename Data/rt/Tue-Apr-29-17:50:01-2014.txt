Weiner gets $28.7 million in stock options, along with $18.7 million in equity awards. </p><p> 2013 was a great year for LinkedIn's stock, gaining 89 percent. Profits on the year were $26.8 million or 23 cents per share, up 24 percent on 2012, when the company earned $21.6 million or 19 cents per share. Revenue climbed 57 percent to $1.53 billion from $972.3 million. By comparison during 2013 the S&amp;P 500 grew by 30 percent. </p><p> “<em>The company is taking into consideration the success LinkedIn has had and is viewing this as a long-term award, something that will be meant to cover several years of equity,</em>” Bloomberg quotes Aaron Boyd, the director of governance research at compensation-research firm Equilar Inc. “<em>In technology, we’ve seen some large equity awards over the last several years</em>.” </p><p> Jeff Weiner is earning much more than some of his social media peers. Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo made $130,250 in 2013, the year the company went public. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg earned $653,165, including a $1 base salary and corporate benefits including the use of a private jet. </p><p> LinkedIn management say the company’s performance will weaken this year as it targets spending as revenue growth slows. Weiner said in February that LinkedIn will “<em>significantly</em>” expand via establishing new data centers and maintaining long-term projects that may take several years to pay off, according to the Washington post. </p><p> LinkedIn shares have tumbled this year amid a general selloff of social-media stocks, as investors doubt the companies will continue to grow as fast as they have in the past. LinkedIn shares fell 6.4 percent to $148.06 at the close in New York yesterday and have lost a third of their price this year. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155592-spain-robin-hood-banks-duran/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Robin Hood of the Banks’ to RT: We'll create different world with our own rules]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155592-spain-robin-hood-banks-duran/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fc/80/00/enric-duran.jpg" title="Enric Duran (image from http://enricduran.cat)"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 14:58:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/fc/80/00/enric-duran.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Enric Duran, dubbed the ‘Spanish Robin Hood of the Banks’, for swindling 39 banks out of half a million euros to redistribute them to organizations fighting against the established financial system, spoke to RT Spanish to reveal his moves and motives.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fc/80/00/enric-duran.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Enric Duran (image from http://enricduran.cat)" /> <p> In hiding for more than a year, and in serious trouble with the courts, he nonetheless recently decided to break his silence and start speaking to the press to explain his vision and how he went about achieving it. Speaking to RT Spanish by Skype from an undisclosed location, he talks of the ingenious and simple tactic he used to cheat dozens of banks out of a half-million euros. <br><br><em>“I realized that loans below 6,000 euro don’t show up in Spain’s bank database,”</em> he says, revealing the first step on the way to accumulating the fortune that later earned him his moniker. <br><br><em>“As soon as I realized this, I started taking out loans of a little over 5,000 euro, accumulating a certain amount over time. Then, having transferred the whole sum to a single account, and having the ability to prove my financial eligibility, I started taking out bigger credit. It was very convenient to take advantage of the fact that Spain doesn’t update its banking database for months on end. That is how, from December 2007 to January 2008 I was able to take out the bulk of the money,”</em> Duran explained. <br><br> The anti-capitalist takes pride in his actions against the banking system and believes that they are another step towards networking between other anti-capitalists and the setting up of organizations that can work together toward a global system that is not accountable to the established financial order. <br><br> From 2006 until 2008, Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain and gave the money to social activities, like financing conferences against capitalism and providing cameras for an alternative TV channel. <br><em><br> “We wish to create a different world, with our own rules and principles, without a global responsibility to the modern system,”</em> he said of his dream vision. <em>“I knew for a fact that my actions could result in legal measures against me.”</em> <br><br> After spending 2 months in jail, Duran was freed on 50,000 euro bail in February 2013 to face trial. After being convicted he decided to abscond rather than face eight years behind bars. <br><br><em>“I had reasons not to appear at the proceedings. I had presented the regional court with 30 pieces of evidence in support of my case, but it refused every single one of them. On top of that, I only learned about the trial three weeks before the fact, instead of four months in advance, when it was being planned.”</em> <br><br> Duran now continues to work towards his goals from a far-away location, his current project being the development of the Catalan Integral Cooperative – a transnational initiative that puts emphasis on self-development and management, as well as networking and problem solving without the involvement of banks and other types of regulation. It’s strictly by the people, for the people. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155648-psychiatrist-gitmo-detainee-testimony/</guid><title><![CDATA['They went through some form of hell': Psychiatrist for Gitmo detainee testifies]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155648-psychiatrist-gitmo-detainee-testimony/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/00/00/00/guantanamo-detainee.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Mladen Antonov"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 14:47:44 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/00/00/00/guantanamo-detainee.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />An Army psychiatrist said the accused USS Cole bomber was given adequate access to treatment for his mental health problems, although he admitted he had no access the secret CIA files documenting the suspect’s extensive torture, the Miami Herald reports.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/00/00/00/guantanamo-detainee.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Mladen Antonov" /> <p> The doctor, an Army major who was board-certified in psychiatry in 2012, said 49-year-old Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri refused any kind of therapy, Carol Rosenberg, who has covered the story exclusively for the daily, reports. </p><p> Nashiri, who faces the death penalty for his alleged role in the October 2000 USS Cole bombing, was held for four years by the CIA. According to recently unclassified abuse reports, he was interrogated with a waterboard and power drill and subjected to a mock execution. His psychiatrist, identified in court as Doctor 97, testified at the pre-trial hearing on Sunday that the medical records he consulted made no mention of the CIA detention history on any of his patients. <br></p><p> <em>“I have just assumed that they probably went through some form of hell at some point in their life,”</em> Rosenberg cites the doctor, an Army major who testified anonymously from Fort Bliss, Teas via video-link, as saying. </p><p> Last year, a court-appointed US military medical board was authorized to see information about Nashiri’s 2002-06 secret CIA detention and diagnosed him as suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and major depression. </p><p> During an open court session on Thursday, Dr. Sondra Crosby, an expert on treating torture survivors who was privy to Nashiri’s top secret files, said Nashiri <em>“has suffered physical, psychological and sexual torture.”</em> </p><p> While Doctor 97 said he did not know what happened to Nashiri before being detained at Gitmo, he disagreed with the expert. He recently switched the detainees primary diagnosis to Narcissistic Personality Disorder, saying it was more descriptive than <em>“some stressor that happened years ago.”</em> </p><p> <em>“His experience with me,”</em> the psychiatrist said, <em>“he was not demonstrating symptoms at that time, when I was seeing him, of post-traumatic stress disorder.”</em> </p><p> Doctor 97 also said Guantanamo doctors prescribed Nashiri antidepressants and offered him psychotherapy and exposure therapy for anxiety, noting such treatment required a commitment on the part of the patient, as he could get worse before he got better. </p><p> At the heart of the testimony is a claim by Nashiri’s defense team that Guantanamo military doctors have effectively committed medical malpractice by not treating their client for the abuse he suffered as a result of CIA torture. </p><p> His lawyers are requesting that the judge order specialized treatment for their client, as well as training for Guantanamo medical staff dealing with former CIA detainees. </p><p> The prosecution told the judge he should have never heard testimony from a mental health professional in the first place, as Nashiri’s competence to stand trial had never been impugned. </p><p> They are also battling to water down the military judge’s order that the government give the defense some of the CIA’s most sensitive secrets regarding its former black site program – including locations, dates, the identities of medical personnel and cables providing how-to guides on "enhanced interrogation techniques" on Nashiri – arguing that he should not butt into the military’s running of Guantanamo. </p><p> The order, which is further expected to be contested by the CIA, also demands the intelligence agency provide a chronology regarding Nashiri’s life between his 2002 capture in Dubai and his arrival at the Cuban prison facility in 2006. The details from those four years could transform the judge’s decision from a pedestrian court order to a groundbreaking precedent. </p><p> The prosecution has said if the judge doesn’t back down, they’ll appeal outside of Guantanamo, an event which would likely delay the trial until sometime next year. It is currently scheduled to begin in December. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155612-israel-demolish-mosque-palestine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Israeli troops destroy mosque in Palestinian village]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155612-israel-demolish-mosque-palestine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fd/c0/00/khirbet-al-taweel-1.jpg" title="Palestinians walk past a structure after it was demolished by Israeli bulldozers in Khirbet Al-Taweel village near the West Bank City of Nablus April 29, 2014.

(Reuters / Mohamad Torokman)" /> <p> Eighteen Israeli military jeeps and two bulldozers stormed the village of Kherbt al-Taweel near Nablus, to the north of the West Bank early on Tuesday morning and declared the village a closed military zone, Ghassan Douglas, the Palestinian Authority official in charge of monitoring settlement activity in the northern West Bank, told the Anadolu Agency (AA). </p><p> He added that before demolishing the buildings <em>“the forces prevented residents from entering or leaving the village and students from going to their school.”</em> </p><p> <em>"I went to make my dawn prayers at the mosque and found the army surrounding it,"</em> resident Abdel Fattah Maarouf, 63, told Reuters, <em>"Then they tore it down. They want this area so they can build settlements on it."</em> </p><p> A Reuters correspondent said several hundred soldiers were deployed in Khirbet al-Taweel around daybreak. <br> Other buildings that were wiped out by Israeli troops included three family houses, animal shelters and a communal well. </p><p> According to another village resident Anwar Sidki whose home was destroyed, the Israelis did not give him any prior warning. </p><p> <em>"They just demolished the house,"</em> he told AA.<em>"I have five children and a wife. I have to either re-build the house, or they will remain in the streets."</em> </p><p> Meanwhile, the Israeli troops left the village, although they left security at its entrances. </p><p> According to Douglas, the Israelis destroyed the mosque and the houses <em>“under the pretext of being built without a permit."</em> </p><p> <em>“Israel has long sought to control the village because of its strategic location, which overlooks the Jordan Valley,"</em> added Jawdat Bani Jabr, head of the village council. </p><p> A top Palestinian official, Yasser Abed Rabbo told local radio that <em>"unless acts like this cease completely,"</em> Palestine won’t return to peace talks with Israel. The April-29 deadline has now been missed. </p><p> According to Douglas, Israeli army forces are targeting the village to displace its residents and annex its land to attach it to nearby settlements, or use them for army training. </p><p> Israeli settlements in the West Bank have long been a stumbling block in peace negotiations, as Tel Aviv has refused to freeze the construction of new settlements. </p><p> On Tuesday, Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now reported that Israeli authorities approved about 14,000 settlements during the nine-months peace talks with Palestine. </p><p> <em>"This is an unprecedented number representing an average of 50 housing units per day or 1,540 per month,"</em> Peace Now added. </p><p> Relations between Israel and Palestine have worsened over the past month, culminating in the imposition of sanctions on Palestine by Israel, which included freezing the transfer of taxes. Israel monthly collects some $110 million in taxes on goods bound for the Palestinian territory, which roughly amounts to around two-thirds of the income received by the Palestinian Authority. </p><p> On April 23, Israel suspended peace talks with Palestine over the unity deal signed in Gaza between the Hamas group (considered terrorist in Israel) and Abbas's Fatah faction. </p><p> Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said that Palestine must choose either peace with Israel or an alliance with Hamas, but it cannot have both. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155632-uk-tube-strike-london/</guid><title><![CDATA[Tube strike incapacitates London in 48-hour action against job cuts]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155632-uk-tube-strike-london/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ff/00/00/london-underground-strike.jpg" title="Commuters jostle for access to buses near Victoria station in London, on April 29, 2014, as a planned 48 hour underground train strike came into effect late Monday night.

There has also been a 70 percent increase in London ‘Boris bike’ cycle hires. <br><br> The London Underground and the union have met for negotiations some 40 times since February, when another mass strike temporarily shut down 60 percent of all services. However, discussions collapsed on Monday. <br><br> The strike is to end at 20:59 local time on Wednesday but it has been predicted that a hangover from the upheaval will still be plaguing the capital on Thursday morning. <br><br> Travel disruptions are likely to impact university students sitting exams.

Is there any real difference?</em> </p><p> <strong>Gideon Levy:</strong> Yes, there is a difference. There is also a difference between defining Israel as an apartheid state and defining the occupation as an apartheid regime. But what does it really matter? It looks like apartheid, it works like apartheid, so it is apartheid. Israel in its sovereign borders isn’t an apartheid state, not yet. But Israel in the occupied territories is definitely an apartheid regime when there are two peoples, one have all the rights in the world and the other without any civil rights whatsoever. This is apartheid. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The US State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki stumbled when grilled over this question. So the US appears to be afraid to strongly criticize Israel. Does that make it harder to make any progress in the peace process?</em> </p><p> <strong>GL:</strong> I think that John Kerry said the truth, and Israel should confront the truth, and the truth is that without the peace process, without this two-state solution Israel is going in this direction, and the world is going to recognize that this is the direction that Israel has chosen. If this is the case, it’s better that Israel understands in time that that’s its fate to become an apartheid sate which no country in the world, maybe not even the US, will recognize. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>America has warned of Israeli isolation and even a global boycott. Are Washington and Tel Aviv actually moving apart?</em> </p><p> <strong>GL:</strong> Not yet. You see, even Secretary of State Kerry says something and immediately he finds himself apologizing and regretting what he said, God knows why. I don’t know why he can’t stay behind what he said; he said very clear things about the future, not about the present. I don’t understand what kind of pressure was put on him and how come the Secretary of State can’t stand behind what he said and what is the truth. In any case, fortunately or unfortunately, the relations between Israel and the US is still so strong and so solid, and this will take some more time to see really cracks in this connection. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Israel has approved thousands more settlements after the last negotiations began. Is this the main stumbling block now?</em> </p><p> <strong>GL:</strong> No, it’s only one of them. Israel claims that Mahmoud Abbas took one-sided steps by appealing to some kind of international organizations, but at the same time Israel took the most one-sided and maybe even irreversible step, namely building more and more settlements. There is no other way to judge the real genuine intention of Israel rather than to check its settlements policy. Any time that Israel is building even one more building in the occupied territories, that’s the indication that Israel has no intention whatsoever to retreat and to make peace. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why can't Kerry stand by his word? Is that because of the Israeli lobby in the US?</em> </p><p> <strong>GL:</strong> That’s really a mystery. I’m not sure that anyone can really answer it because if you judge it in rational terms, how strong can the Israeli lobby be, how powerful can it be? The US also has its own interests and many times those interests are supposed to be contradictory to Israeli interests, and still you see again and again many American politician who dare to say the truth, who dare to criticize Israel even in a very cautious way, immediately has to apologize, to retreat for what he has said. This is really a mystery and I wish I knew the answer. For sure it doesn’t make any sense. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155608-uk-economy-growth-q1/</guid><title><![CDATA[UK economy's fastest acceleration in 6 years]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155608-uk-economy-growth-q1/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fd/80/00/house-of-parliament.jpg" title="Reuters / Stefan Wermuth"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 13:52:47 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/fd/80/00/house-of-parliament.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Growth in the UK has accelerated to 0.8 percent in the first three months of 2014, but hasn’t recovered to pre-recession levels, according to the Office for National Statistics in London.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fd/80/00/house-of-parliament.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Stefan Wermuth" /> <p> From January-March, GDP, the main indicator of growth, narrowly missed the forecast 0.9 percent, but is still hailed as strong and robust, as it marks the country’s fifth consecutive period of growth, and makes it the fastest-growing economy among the G8. </p><p> However, GDP is still 0.6 percent below its peak level of 6 years ago, before the financial crisis hit in 2008 which wiped out 7.2 percent of the economy. </p><p> <em>"Today's figures show that Britain is coming back – but we can't take that for granted. We have to carry on working through our long term economic plan,"</em> Chancellor George Osborne said. </p><p> Year-on-year growth was 3.1 percent, which also missed the 3.2 percent forecasts, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_361287.pdf" target="_blank">released</a> today. </p><p> Growth occurred in three out of the four main industry groups in the economy. British manufacturing increased 1.3 percent, industrial production jumped by 0.8 percent, but the construction sector only grew 0.3 percent. The report suggests construction output was held back by heavy rain and <a href="http://rt.com/news/uk-charlie-storm-weather-191/" target="_blank">storms</a> the island experienced in January and February. </p><p> Agriculture disappointed with output decreasing by 0.7 percent. Britain’s strong service industry accelerated by 0.8 percent. </p><p> The UK is well on its way to recovering from the devastating effects of the 2008-2009 collapse, which sunk the economy into a steep recession. </p><p> Without the drag from a shrinking oil and gas sector the economy was 0.3% bigger than its pre-crisis peak, statisticians added. </p><p> The Bank of England expects unemployment to fall to 7 percent by the spring. Economic outlook for 2014 is overall positive with the IMF forecasting 2.4 percent growth– higher than any other European economy. </p><p> Britain is pushing to keep its distance from the eurozone economy, which continues to struggle with currency and regional issues. </p><p> Despite the strong growth, the Bank of England will likely not change its position on raising interest rates from 0.5 percent until unemployment falls to 7 percent. </p><p> UK unemployment currently stands at 7.2 percent, while youth unemployment is much higher - 19.8 percent.

The US president’s recent trip to the region was the most significant and tangible development to occur since the rebalancing policy was unveiled. </p><p> Obama’s trip had two primary dimensions: deepening the role of the US military throughout the Asia-Pacific, and shoring up support for the faltering Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, an all-encompassing trade deal led by Washington that would embolden transnational corporate power at great public expense. </p><p> As the Obama administration moves ahead on plans to relocate some 60 percent of its navy into the region, Washington's current Asia doctrine is grounded in the notion that no other power can be allowed to reach parity with the United States. Washington’s strategy to pivot toward the Asia-Pacific is adorned with the language of pragmatism and neutrality, and despite repeated denials, the Obama administration’s actions are quite transparently aimed at capping the influence of a rapidly developing China. </p><p> Washington has inserted itself into complicated, long-standing historical and territorial disputes under the guise of neutrality, which risks potentially setting the stage for an irreparable strategic blunder: antagonizing two major world powers simultaneously at a time when relations between the US and Russia are already deteriorating over the crisis in Ukraine. </p><p> President Obama’s milestone four-nation tour of the Asia-Pacific may have laid the foundations for the region’s local territorial disputes to grow into an increasing tense superpower stand-off. </p><h2> Japan refuses to yield on trade </h2><p> The US president’s visit to Japan comes at a time when the right-leaning administration of Shinzo Abe has taken controversial positions on historical and territorial issues that have inflamed relations with China and South Korea, which view the incumbent Japanese government as being openly unrepentant for past atrocities. </p><p> </p><p> The White House previously expressed reservations toward Abe’s calls to consider revising official apologies over Japan’s wartime conduct, and his controversial visit to the Yasukuni shrine that honors Japan’s WWII war dead, including over a dozen convicted Class-A war criminals. Abe made a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine shortly before Obama’s arrival in Tokyo, followed by 146 Japanese lawmakers who visited the shrine en masse one day later, putting the US president in an awkward situation. </p><p> These provocative gestures did little to derail Obama’s support for Japan’s position in its tense territorial dispute with China over a chain of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. In an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/qanda-japans-yomiuri-shimbun-interviews-president-obama/2014/04/23/d01bb5fc-cae3-11e3-95f7-7ecdde72d2ea_story.html" target="_blank">interview</a> with Japan’s Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, Obama affirmed that the disputed islands fell within the scope of Article 5 of the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, meaning that Washington would be obliged to back Japan in the event of a military confrontation over the islands with Beijing, which views the islands as an integral part of its territory. </p><p> Obama also enthusiastically pledged support for Abe’s moves to amend Japan’s post-war pacifist constitution, which has traditionally limited Japan’s armed forces from going beyond a self-defense role. </p><p> In the interest of expanding the US-Japan alliance to counter the growing clout of China, the US president has given Japanese rightists a green light to pursue militarization policies that will undoubtedly fuel regional antagonism. Rather than taking a neutral position and steering Tokyo toward a de-escalation with Beijing, Obama has effectively sent Abe the message that he can challenge China’s bottom line without serious repercussions, encouraging Japan to continue its inflexible position. Obama may have hoped that in exchange for backing Japan’s stance on territorial disputes and constitutional reform, Abe would have reciprocated by yielding on thorny trade issues, but he was wrong. </p><p> <a href="http://www.therakyatpost.com/world/2014/04/24/obama-ate-only-half-the-sushi-course/" target="_blank">Obama</a> allegedly put his chopsticks down halfway through his informal sushi dinner with Abe and jumped straight into discussions about trade. The White House is anxious to seal the TPP trade deal, but is unwilling to give significant concessions, forcing all countries to meet rigid criteria. Abe risks losing support from his conservative voter base by reducing tariffs on areas such as rice, sugar, beef, pork and dairy that would adversely affect Japanese farmers. Obama was expecting to come to a final agreement with Abe, but trade <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/obama-opens-japan-trip-famous-sushi-restaurant-115936720--politics.html" target="_blank">negotiators</a> claim that there is still <em>“considerable distance”</em> between the US and Japan on key issues in the deal. </p><p> Trade talks are not expected to recommence anytime soon, and Obama was forced to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/obama-opens-country-asia-pacific-trip-tokyo-23435473?singlePage=true" target="_blank">reject suggestions</a> that the deal is in danger over his failure to persuade Abe into making painful concessions. </p><h2> Dialogue with Pyongyang ruled out? </h2><p> Obama’s trip to South Korea came as the country was still reeling from the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry, which killed scores of youngsters. Security topped the agenda as reports of increased activity at North Korea’s Punggye-ri nuclear test site wrought condemnation from Seoul. President Park Geun-hye adopted a hardline stance, calling for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/world/asia/obama-asia.html?_r=0" target="_blank">rejection</a> of dialogue with Pyongyang over the nuclear issue if the North conducts a fourth nuclear test as expected. </p><p> </p><p> Pyongyang <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/01/north-korea-peace-offensive-how-s-2014129908649855.html" target="_blank">proposed</a> a framework for better relations with the South at the start of this year and urged its willingness to meet for negotiations on the nuclear issue without any preconditions. The attempted thaw in relations culminated in reunions of separated families in February, amid Pyongyang’s calls for Seoul to cancel its planned joint military drills with the US. </p><p> Given the circumstances, South Korean authorities could have toned down this year’s drills as a gesture of reciprocity following Pyongyang’s moves to host family reunions. Seoul’s response was to hold the largest amphibian landing exercise with the US in over two decades, followed by large-scale war exercises. The lack of sincere measures to cool ties with Pyongyang is evident in the actions of Seoul and Washington, who are quick to accuse the North of provocations while flexing military muscles on its doorstep, ratcheting up anxiety and insecurity. </p><p> Park and the Obama administration refuse to open dialogue with Pyongyang unless it agrees to denuclearization as a precondition, despite <a href="http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/634534.html" target="_blank">pressure</a> from China that preconditions be relaxed to allow the recommencement of the Six-Party talks. </p><p> During a joint press conference, Park <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/04/25/press-conference-president-obama-and-president-park-republic-korea" target="_blank">announced</a> that plans to transfer operational command of South Korea’s military in time of war, or OPCON, from the US to South Korea would be further delayed, giving the Pentagon de-facto control over South Korea’s military forces beyond December 2015. </p><p> Washington has also encouraged Seoul to strengthen missile defense cooperation – which Park agreed to do – while deepening trilateral cooperation between the US, Japan, and South Korea. During his trip, Obama called for more sanctions against North Korea and spoke of America’s capacity for military might, creating every indication that Washington’s antagonistic ‘strategic patience’ policy against Pyongyang will remain unchanged. </p><h2> Malaysia’s delicate balancing act </h2><p> Western media have billed Obama’s trip to Malaysia – the first visit by a US president in nearly five decades – as being quite successful. Malaysia was the only Muslim-majority country on the president’s four-nation tour, and the only country not to have an existing security treaty with the United States. </p><p> Washington and Kuala Lumpur have always enjoyed strong trade relations, but political relations were known to be tense during the 22-year tenure of former PM Mahathir Mohamad, who took strong positions against US foreign policy. Prime Minister Najib Razak, a British-educated economist who assumed office in 2009 as a reformer, has been much friendlier to the US. </p><p> The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/world/asia/obama-malaysia.html?hp&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">described</a> Malaysian leadership’s change of attitude as an evolution from “deep suspicion, verging on contempt, to a cautious desire for cooperation.” Suspicious attitudes toward the US are still commonplace among certain factions within the ruling party and the conservative religious establishment. Several far-right Malay rights groups share the same misgivings, lashing out at Obama following <a href="http://www.therakyatpost.com/news/2014/04/28/obama-straining-racial-ties/" target="_blank">statements</a> he made on racial equality in the country. </p><p> </p><p> Trade and security topped the agenda during Obama’s visit, and although progress was made in both areas, it’s likely that the US delegation was hoping for a firmer stance on issues such as territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Malaysia is China’s largest trading partner within the ASEAN bloc, and of all the countries in the region who have territorial disputes with Beijing, the approach taken by Kuala Lumpur has been the most low-key and non-adversarial. Sino-Malaysian ties were upgraded to a ‘comprehensive strategic partnership’ level during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Kuala Lumpur in October 2013, while Najib and Obama agreed to upgrade ties to a ‘comprehensive partnership’ at a joint news conference following their talks on Sunday. </p><p> In the joint <a href="http://www.1malaysia.com.my/blog/pm-najib-razak-remarks-at-joint-press-conference-with-president-obama/" target="_blank">statement</a> prepared by the two sides, Najib called for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties regarding the South China Sea disputes, which Chinese state-media <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/857171.shtml#.U13WRhy9d68" target="_blank">welcomed</a>, saying that Malaysia showed a balanced attitude to avoid confrontation with China. <br><br> In an interview with Malaysian newspaper <a href="http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/04/26/Extending-a-hand-of-partnership/" target="_blank">The Star</a>, Obama alluded to his administration’s commitment to ensuring the “freedom of navigation in critical waterways,” which can be understood as a euphemism for policing the Straits of Malacca, one of China’s most critical supply routes responsible for transporting much of the oil and raw materials needed by Beijing to maintain high economic growth. Malaysia allows American warships to dock at ports throughout the country, but does not host any US military bases, and does not seek a hostile relationship with Beijing. </p><p> It is unclear how deep Malaysia’s commitment to security cooperation with the US will go, although the Obama administration has pledged to assist in the development of Malaysia’s maritime enforcement capacity, setting the stage for deeper military-to-military cooperation. In the economic sphere, there were no breakthroughs on the TPP trade deal, with both sides admitting that significant differences still remain. </p><p> Najib, however, made clear that the overall benefits of the TPP would far outweigh the disadvantages of the pact; he mentioned his commitment to getting acceptance from Malaysian people, but offered no specifics on how public acceptance of the trade deal would be measured. Mahathir, who still exerts a degree of influence on traditionalists within the ruling party, <a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v7/bu/newsbusiness.php?id=1033736" target="_blank">commented</a> that Malaysia should not be pressured to agree to the terms stipulated by the TPP. The former PM has routinely called for the trade deal to be dropped, and a large segment of Malaysian civil society and activists are also opposed to the deal. </p><p> As a country that has put much emphasis on a non-confrontational foreign policy, Malaysia is well suited to leverage its good ties with Washington and Beijing to promote a conciliatory solution to territorial issues. Malaysia finds itself somewhere between being a warm friend to the Obama administration but not yet a staunch US ally with deep security ties. </p><h2> Philippines signs 10-year defense agreement </h2><p> To coincide with the last stop of his four-nation tour, Washington and Manila inked a controversial defense <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/04/us-philippines-sign-ten-year-defence-pact-201442861348477236.html" target="_blank">agreement</a> to allow greater numbers of US soldiers to remain in the country on a rotational basis. </p><p> The reopening of foreign bases is prohibited by the 1987 Constitution, but the latest defense pact – negotiated largely in secret, and fast-tracked into law under the auspices of an executive agreement without ratification by the Philippine Congress – gives the US government de facto basing access in the country. </p><p> </p><p> The US maintained large military bases in northern regions of the Philippines until the Philippines congress voted to close them down in 1991, but American forces were allowed to return in 1999 under a temporary stay agreement that saw US troops conduct joint training with the Philippines military. The new agreement is far broader, allowing the US military to establish permanent facilities within Philippine military facilities, also paving the way for American military technology to be sold to the Philippines. </p><p> Philippines President Benigno Aquino’s rationale for expanding the US presence in his country is to provide the Philippines with a powerful deterrent in the midst of Manila’s bitter territorial row with Beijing, as both countries lay claim to the Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal in the potentially oil- and gas-rich South China Sea. The Philippines and its neighbors undoubtedly have firm and legitimate grievances in the interest of protecting their sovereignty and territorial integrity. </p><p> It should be recognized that the disputed features falls within the Philippine’s 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone as recognized by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea; China has resisted applying the procedures stipulated by the law to the many reefs and islands that lie much closer to the Philippines than to China. Manila has argued that Beijing has an obligation to respect the Philippines' rights to exercise control over areas that fall within its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone. </p><p> China claims that its sovereignty over the disputed areas can be supported by abundant historical and legal evidence, which also support Beijing’s maritime rights over three-quarters of the South China Sea. Beijing has consistently called for settling territorial issues through direct bilateral negotiations. Earlier this year, it offered the Philippines mutual disengagement from the contested area, trade and investment benefits, and postponement of the plans to declare an air defense identification zone over the South China Sea. The Philippines leadership rejected the proposal, and unilaterally filed a case with the tribunal that arbitrates maritime disputes under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. </p><p> China has resolved territorial disputes with 12 of the 14 countries with which it shares land borders, and the immense complexities of these maritime territorial disputes require levelheaded dialogue and a commitment from negotiations by both sides. </p><p> The Philippines leadership may have legitimate grievances, but is clearly not committed to seeking a resolution through dialogue, resorting to hyperbolic name-calling. In an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/asia/philippine-leader-urges-international-help-in-resisting-chinas-sea-claims.html?_r=0" target="_blank">interview</a> with the New York Times, Aquino compared China to Nazi Germany, causing immense harm to bilateral relations with Beijing. </p><p> Much like the Obama administration’s position on Japan’s territorial disputes, there is now a concern that backing by the US military can encourage Manila to take a provocative and reckless stance. </p><p> Washington has entered the regional fold claiming to be a neutral party and mediating force, yet it supports the territorial claims of its allies and uses them as a justification to maximize its own interests, transforming a regional dispute into a potential super-power conflict, reducing the possibility for any peaceful settlement. </p><p> The recent security developments will deepen Manila’s historic dependency on the United States, reinforcing its colonial subordination to the strategic, military and regional priorities of American hegemony. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155596-india-pakistan-tensions-in-relations/</guid><title><![CDATA[Indo-Pak: Whose War is it?]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155596-india-pakistan-tensions-in-relations/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fc/c0/00/pakistan-india.jpg" title="Reuters / Amit Gupta"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 12:59:09 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fc/c0/00/pakistan-india.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />If the Indo-Pak conflict is a consequence of divergent viewpoints, should it happen at the cost of so many lives? Is it not time we moved on and attended to the more pressing internal issues that both countries face?]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fc/c0/00/pakistan-india.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Amit Gupta" /> <p> Indian politician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaswant_Singh" target="_blank">Jaswant Singh</a>, former Minister of Finance, External Affairs and Defense (1998 to 2004), is contesting the parliamentary elections as an independent candidate from Western India’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barmer_" target="_blank">Barmer</a> district, bordering Sindh in Pakistan. The area’s 213,000 Muslim voters (mostly <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaipur/pakistan-connection-to-decide-barmer-winner/article1-1199834.aspx" target="_blank">Sindhi</a> Muslims with strong roots in Pakistan) are reportedly <a href="http://www.one.in/hindustantimes-chennai/with-love-from-pakistan-rebel-jaswant-takes-on-bjp-tomorrow-1586040.html" target="_blank">supporting</a> him in great numbers. </p><p> They cite two main reasons. First, their religious leader from across the border, Pir Shibghatullah Shah, chief of the Pakistan based Peer Pagara sect and son of the late Syed Mardan Shah - the then president of the Pakistan Muslim League – who Mr Singh had visited in 2006, has asked his followers in Barmer to vote for Jaswant Singh. The other is Mr Singh’s effort (during his tenure) in initiating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thar_Express" target="_blank">Thar Express</a> between Munabao (Barmer) to Khokhrapar (Pakistan) and helping people get visas to <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/elections2014/election-beat/with-love-from-pakistan-rebel-jaswant-takes-on-bjp-tomorrow/article1-1208765.aspx" target="_blank">visit</a> their birthplace and families in Pakistan. </p><p> Like Barmer, there are many regions in India, especially ones bordering Pakistan, where people have strong roots in the neighboring country and vice versa. </p><p> After the 1947 partition of British India into two – Pakistan and India, followed by the bloody <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/partition1947_01.shtml" target="_blank">outbreak</a> between Hindus and Muslims some 10 million families were dispersed with members on either side of the divide; many have yet to be reunited. </p><p> The current state of Indo-Pak relations is widely believed to be rooted in the partition and its bitter memories. </p><p> However there’s another <a href="http://religionconflictpeace.org/volume-4-issue-2-spring-2011/traces-humanity-indo-pak-history" target="_blank">school of thought</a> that speaks of <em>‘humanity’</em> amidst the gruesome history of partition referring to instances of Hindus rescuing members of the Muslim community and vice versa, each risking their own lives in the process. According to scholars, at least 25-30 percent of <a href="http://religionconflictpeace.org/volume-4-issue-2-spring-2011/traces-humanity-indo-pak-history" target="_blank">people</a> belonged to this category. </p><p> Does this mean then there is scope to look at partition, and hence at Indo-Pak relations, from the fresh perspective of the solidarity between common men that existed 67 years ago and continues today in Barmer? </p><p> </p><h2> ‘Time to prevail over mistrust’ </h2><p> Farahnaz Ispahani, a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center and a Pakistani politician who served as a Member of Parliament and media adviser to the president of Pakistan, says, <em>“Both Pakistan and India have underplayed the common history and commonalities of culture and tradition, particularly between northern India and Pakistan. It is time for the democratically elected political leaders on both sides to prevail over their countries military and intelligence agencies fears and mistrust – though not always unfounded – a step forward must be taken to enable future peace.”</em> </p><p> We have fought three major <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars#Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947" target="_blank">wars</a> apart from the undeclared <a href="%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War" target="_blank">Kargil war</a>. In each, maximum casualties were borne by the common people on both sides of the border. According to <a href="http://amankiasha.com/detail_news.asp?id=306" target="_blank">reports</a> about 100,000 civilians were direct victims through casualties and internal displacement. </p><p> People living in the border areas are regularly displaced on a temporary basis during heightened tensions. The Kargil war displaced 130,000 Indians and 40,000 Pakistanis. The 2002 standoff following the December 2001 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Indian_Parliament_attack" target="_blank">attack</a> on the Indian Parliament displaced some 155,000 Indians and 45,000 Pakistanis. </p><p> Where is the account of the psychological and economic costs of these events? </p><p> <em>‘Kashmir’,</em> the inevitable name that surfaces in Indo-Pak relation accounts for three major territorial disputes. What’s the human <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_abuses_in_Jammu_and_Kashmir" target="_blank">cost</a> of these conflicts? Once called a <em>‘</em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1246_land/page9.shtml" target="_blank"><em>paradise on earth’</em></a> is today a land where human rights <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?211099-0" target="_blank">violations</a> including mass killings, forced disappearances, rape, encounter killings, torture, use of child soldiers, suppression of freedom of speech are committed regularly both by the armed forces and militants alike. </p><p> Speaking to the border residents in the Jammu Kashmir region while they cast their votes in the parliamentary election, news outlet, <a href="http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2014/Apr/11/border-residents-vote-for-indo-pak-peace-64.asp" target="_blank">Greater Kashmir</a>, reports that peace between India and Pakistan is the prime concern of the region’s people. Young people want employment and better facilities, all of which they say are possible with peace. </p><p> If peace is what the people want, whose wars are these then? </p><h2> Too uncompromising </h2><p> Michael Kugelman, senior program associate for South and Southeast Asia at the Woodrow Wilson Centre feels it’s a war of divergent viewpoints between two nations: <em>“In Pakistan, some still believe India poses an existential threat to Pakistan, even though this is a wildly inaccurate perception. And in India, there is a strongly held view that Kashmir has been settled and can never be renegotiated. Such uncompromising views have essentially kept the countries from reconciling.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Kugelman adds, <em>“In both countries, there are plenty of people whose dislike and outright hatred of the other militates against more reasonable and conciliatory thinking.”</em> </p><p> However, lately the progressive minded are finding their voices for peace through mediums such as bilateral trade talks and Track II diplomacy. As retired Brigadier of the Indian Army and author of Vintage Guns of India, SK Chatterji, mentions, <em>“Some of the positive developments of late include, trade and commerce, Track II diplomacy, sports and games, dialogues at the government level, apart from the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC), meetings between commanders at the LoC, the hotline between the Director General of Military Operations of both countries.”</em> </p><p> Indeed, we are seeing efforts towards tapping the huge potential of Indo–Pak trade, a mere $3 billion today, with possibilities of reaching a whopping <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/349146/pak-india-trade-still-a-fraction-of-40-billion-potential/" target="_blank">$40 billion</a>. Pakistan almost granted non-discriminatory market access (<a href="http://www.smetimes.in/smetimes/news/top-stories/2014/Apr/09/india-pak-mfn-talks-on-hold-till-election-over29159.html#sthash.1FZ7kJKI.dpuf" target="_blank">NDMA</a>) to India on a reciprocal <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1090000/mfn-status-to-india-linked-with-meaningful-market-access" target="_blank">basis</a> early this year when the entire talk came to a <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-29239-Trade-deal-with-India-hits-snag-because-of-GHQs-silence" target="_blank">standstill</a>. </p><p> Many believe bilateral trade wouldn’t just bring about economic benefits, but also ease out the overall relationship. As Kugelman mentions, <em>“Both will benefit economically, though especially Pakistan, given that India has the larger economy and would have more to offer Pakistan in terms of cheap and diverse goods. India, however, can also benefit from cheap Pakistani products where it doesn't have a comparative advantage. Another big advantage of closer trade ties is the confidence-building element.”</em> </p><p> Track II diplomacy from which significant initiatives were born, like <a href="http://amankiasha.com/" target="_blank">Aman ki Asha</a>, a campaign jointly started by two leading media houses, The Jang Group (Pakistan) and The Times of India (India), to promote bilateral cooperation through the media. </p><p> Recently, in March of this year, the 4th <a href="http://jinnah-institute.org/delhi-dialogue-iii/" target="_blank">Delhi Dialogue</a> was concluded. Arranged by the Jinnah Institute and the Centre for Dialogue and Reconstruction, the meeting released a joint resolution stating that both Islamabad and New Delhi must move forward on outstanding items in order to extricate the region from the shadows of instability, human insecurity and lost opportunities in trade, energy and information connectivity. </p><p> However, there are dominant elements on both sides which may foil this progressive outlook for their own vested interests. This is best encapsulated by Ispahani when she says, <em>“As long as we have incidents like the Mumbai Massacre and incidents in the Balochistan area of Pakistan where the separatists/freedom fighters are felt to have the backing of the Indian state, it will be difficult to change attitudes overnight.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Experts believe trade will be particularly resisted by the dominant <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/04/14/India-Pakistan-trade-Islamabad-in-a-bind.aspx?COLLCC=3341867869&amp;" target="_blank">military establishment</a> of Pakistan. Primarily because of anxieties and fears of diminishing military importance in case of a rising trade volume which might result in better bilateral relation, and is hence a blow to the notion of the security threat from India that justifies the huge consumption of the country’s budget and GDP by the Pakistani military <em>(<a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/04/14/India-Pakistan-trade-Islamabad-in-a-bind.aspx?COLLCC=3341867869&amp;" target="_blank">"India-Pakistan trade: Islamabad in a bind"</a></em> by Dr Raza Khan Qazi) . There’s also a possibility of an eventual shift of power in policy-making to the democratic leadership and civil society. </p><p> Pakistani American scholar, Ayesha Jalal, Mary Richardson Professor of History and Director of the Center for South Asian and Indian Ocean Studies at Tufts University also cautions about the <em>“agricultural lobby in Pakistan - that sees improved Indo-Pakistan trade as a threat to their economic interests.”</em> The Farmers’ Association of Pakistan and Rice Millers Association, are <a href="%20http://www.oryza.com/news/rice-news/pakistan-rice-farmer-groups-oppose-mfn-status-india#sthash.DJwP0qOV.dpuf" target="_blank">opposing</a> the NDMA’s status with India, stating they want the government to assure safeguards for the agriculture sector and protect it from unfair competition. </p><p> In India there’s a huge possibility of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party" target="_blank">Bharatya Janta Party</a> (BJP) coming to power. While many are hopeful of better trade ties with India, given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi" target="_blank">Narendra Modi’s</a> (BJP’s prime ministerial candidate) quest for greater economic prosperity, his <a href="http://indiandefence.com/threads/narendra-modi-should-be-flexible-towards-pakistan.45590/" target="_blank">anti-Muslim</a> image is creating a lot of misgivings. </p><p> There are counteractive forces against progress, but recent enthusiasm around trade and Track II diplomacy have brought the Indo-Pak relationship to a people-to-people level, where intellectuals are exchanging their thoughts more openly, and traders are interacting. For the first time in the history of Indo-Pak relations, the section that wants peace and stability in the region has found a voice. This should not be suppressed at any cost. The media, which is a very important influence on public sentiment, plays a huge role here. As Kugelman states, <em>“There is a whole lot of bashing of ‘the other’ (even when the governments are calling for restraint) that really has a troubling impact on public views.”</em> </p><p> The governments of both the countries, and sometimes people, need to see regional peace as condition for economic growth and its sustainability for a stronger South Asia to emerge. The <em>'us'</em> versus <em>'them'</em> attitude is no longer relevant. </p><p> <em>“It is vital to step out of the narrowly construed national paradigms to understand the regional and intra-regional connections that bind peoples across the boundaries of the modern nation-state,”</em> Jalal concurs. </p><p> <em>Jhinuk Chowdhury for RT</em> </p><p> <em>Jhinuk Chowdhury is an India-based former journalist who currently works as an independent writer.

Alongside signs of a diplomatic progress, in particular the agreements reached in Geneva on 17 April, the situation on the ground remains complicated.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fe/00/00/ukraine.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (2nd L) speaks at the start of a quadrilateral meeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry (Top C) and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsya (R) as representatives of the United States, Ukraine, Russia and the European Union meet about the ongoing situation in Ukraine in Geneva on April 17, 2014. (AFP Photo - Pool / Jim Bourg) " /> <p> At the Geneva meeting, Russia, the US, the EU and the Kiev authorities agreed principles that, if implemented, may lead to de-escalation. They include disarming unlawful armed groups, vacating illegally seized public buildings and spaces, an amnesty for all protesters, and the launch of an inclusive, transparent and accountable constitutional process. All parties condemned expressions of extremism, racism and religious intolerance, including anti-Semitism. </p><p> Unfortunately, these provisions have been interpreted in Kiev and in Western capitals as commitments undertaken by Russia with regard to the situation in eastern Ukraine. It is hard to consider this approach as anything but a deliberate distortion of reality. </p><p> First, it is wrong to portray the situation as if the main problem is in eastern Ukraine. Yes, people have taken up arms and seized public buildings. What our Western colleagues don’t want to see is that these actions are a reaction to what happened in Kiev – to the violent unconstitutional coup, to attempts to curtail the status of the Russian language, to calls by extremists for punitive operations in the east, to the inability of the authorities to end provocation or begin meaningful dialogue with Russian-speaking regions. One cannot expect people to go home when no steps are being taken to end the threats from Kiev and western Ukraine. </p><p> Second, it is unacceptable that the situation in the east is described as being the result of Russian meddling. We haven’t seen the slightest proof of that. Kiev and Washington are unable to corroborate their claims by anything other than the fact that the activists speak Russian and hold Kalashnikovs – which is also the case for most Ukrainian servicemen in that area. British reporters on the ground overwhelmingly agree the protest movement has local roots and is manned by local residents. That Russia can order them to stop protesting is pure fantasy. </p><p> In short, by blaming eastern activists and Russia, Kiev and their Western backers are trying to divert attention from the lack of positive steps on their part. Instead of disarming Right Sector extremists, the authorities in Kiev are continuing to threaten the east with an <em>“anti-terrorist”</em> operation to be performed with the participation of <em>“civil society activists.”</em> Those are openly recruited by the neo-Nazi Right Sector group in Maidan [Independence Square] in Kiev. </p><p> The protest camp in central Kiev is still in place, and the authorities have announced that the Geneva agreement doesn’t apply to it since it is <em>“lawful.”</em> No amnesty law has been passed; on the contrary, many protesters are still in detention, including one of the leaders of the movement in Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev, who has gone on a hunger strike in protest. The constitutional process remains behind closed doors with no eastern participation, in spite of clear public proposals made by a number of eastern forces as well as the Party of the Regions. In this context, it is amazing to read about Western politicians praising the efforts of the Kiev government in <em>“implementing”</em> the Geneva accords and calling upon Russia to follow suit. </p><p> As with many other international and domestic crises, the key thing that Ukraine is lacking is trust. The authorities in Kiev badly need to take urgent, clear and meaningful steps that will (if not generate confidence) at least limit the current level of mistrust that the east feels towards them. Time is running out, and not only in terms of growing frustration and determination of the eastern movement, but also in the light of the dire economic situation in Ukraine. If the current leaders continue to see the situation exclusively through the prism of <em>“Russian aggression”</em> instead of addressing the real problems, they risk plunging their country into an economic abyss. Such a scenario is deeply troubling for Russia and the Russian people, who wish their Ukrainian brothers and sisters well, but the risks are increasing with every day that passes. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155296-india-crimea-ukraine-integrity/</guid><title><![CDATA[India supports Russia over Crimea but stresses Ukraine integrity]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155296-india-crimea-ukraine-integrity/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/00/00/india-crimea.jpg" title="A pro-federalization protester shout slogans as she waves a Russian flag outside a regional government building in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine April 23, 2014.

But there is a difference.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/ea/00/00/india-crimea.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A pro-federalization protester shout slogans as she waves a Russian flag outside a regional government building in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine April 23, 2014. (Reuters)" /> <p> As recently as the third week of April, India's top diplomat told the Russians to de-escalate tensions with the West over the Ukraine issue while conveying India's total understanding to the Russians on the subject. </p><p> This was conveyed by Indian Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh to her Russian colleagues during an official visit to Moscow on April 15-17, her first independent visit to Russia since she took over last year. Singh co-chaired the India-Russia Foreign Office Consultations (FoCs) with her counterparts, Vladimir Titov, First Deputy Foreign Minister and Igor Morgulov, Deputy Foreign Minister, on April 16. </p><p> Significantly, the Russians gave a detailed briefing to the Indians on the Ukraine situation and Moscow’s efforts to resolve the crisis. What has come out through official Indian channels about Singh's talks with her Russian counterparts is dense, full of clichés and, therefore, needs to be decoded. </p><p> First, the official Indian version. </p><p> Sujatha Singh reiterated India’s position – calls on all sides to exercise restraint and work together constructively to find political and diplomatic solutions that would safeguard the legitimate interests of all sections of Ukraine’s population, of all countries in the region and promote long-term peace and stability in Europe and beyond. The two sides also discussed Russia’s then upcoming talks with Ukraine, USA and EU in Geneva on April 17. </p><p> While reiterating its support for Moscow on Crimea’s merger with Russia, New Delhi stressed that India is for the unity and integrity of Ukraine, meaning while India is supportive of the Russian moves with regard to Crimea, New Delhi does not favor use of force by Russia against Ukraine. The Russian side told the Indians that it has no belligerent intentions against Ukraine. </p><p> </p><p> Significantly, Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union successfully brokered an international agreement in Geneva on April 17. The deal envisages disarmament of armed groups in eastern Ukraine and a give-and-take with separatists: their vacation of occupied government buildings in exchange for a solemn assurance by the Ukraine government to grant total amnesty to separatists. The US too has agreed to delay another round of sanctions after Russia agreed not to intervene in Ukraine. </p><p> However, on the flip side, international deals like the one in Geneva over Ukraine normally hang from a slender thread and many deal breakers may pop up any time. One such potential deal breaker is the continued defiance of the separatists in Donetsk who have taken the extreme step of declaring themselves as the independent <em>"Donetsk People's Republic".</em> These separatists are pushing the envelope further by saying that they will not vacate the government buildings until the government in Kiev steps down. </p><p> The Ukraine melting pot is set to make international news headlines in the coming days and weeks. There will be a laser beam focus on recently self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic whose leadership has declared its decision to hold a referendum simultaneously with east Ukraine’s Lugansk region. A total of 3.5 million voters, living in the Donetsk Oblast, are eligible to take part in the referendum. </p><p> Denis Pushilin, co-chairman of the Donetsk People’s Republic presidium, has gone on record as telling ITAR-TASS in an interview that Central and district election committees were already formed in Donetsk region and <em>“printing of ballot papers will begin soon”.</em> </p><p> “A referendum will be held no later than on May 11 and it is highly probable that Lugansk will also hold it with us no later than on May 11. Lugansk just has to confirm similar wording of the question. Our question is as follows, <em>“Do you support the independence of Donetsk People’s Republic?”</em> Pushilin said in this interview. </p><h2> India to follow pragmatic diplomacy </h2><p> The Indian response to the Ukraine crisis has been pragmatic and will likely remain so even if Russia were to take extreme steps vis–à–vis Ukraine. </p><p> For argument sake, let us consider the worst scenario: that Russia does bring its military forces into Ukraine. Even in such a scenario it is not likely that India would come up with a public condemnation of Russia. India would definitely come up with a statement, but its tone and tenor would hardly be hard-hitting. An Indian statement in such a scenario would only take the middle path, stressing the need for all stakeholders to resolve all issues through peaceful negotiations, and taking full care that India does not float an impression that it is wading into a Russia-West spat. </p><p> India has far more at stake with Russia than with Ukraine. Even in the Russia versus the West scenario, India cannot ditch Russia. The Western world, led by the United States, has been mercurial and tried to balance India with Pakistan. The Russians have never done that and solidly supported India for the past four decades. </p><p> In a way, India’s future response to the Ukraine developments has already been conveyed to Ukraine rather subtly. </p><p> On February 28, at the peak of Russian actions in Crimea, the Ukraine ambassador in New Delhi, Oleksandr Shevchenko, met Dinkar Khullar, Secretary (West) in the Ministry of External Affairs. </p><p> The Ukraine envoy made two requests: India’s support and the Indian recognition of the new government in Kiev. </p><p> Unsurprisingly, the envoy returned empty handed. He was politely told that India will have to undertake internal consultations on the issue and formulate a stand, if required. As they say, speech is silver - silence golden! </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155640-protesters-government-building-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Anti-Kiev protesters take control of govt building in Lugansk Region, east Ukraine]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155640-protesters-government-building-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ff/80/00/lugansk-2.jpg" title="Screenshot from www.ustream.tv"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 12:26:54 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ff/80/00/lugansk-2.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Lugansk self-defense activists have entered the regional administration building, causing police officers to vacate it.

He has said that anti-government protesters are now negotiating with armed police, who activists blocked in the back yard, in order to persuade them to surrender their weapons and leave. </p><p> A small group of guards barricaded themselves in one of the corridors of the building, according to footage from the scene. The protesters convinced them to leave. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bCbYLaF-kHA" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> The protesters, some of them armed with clubs and metal shields, have spread throughout the building. </p><p> No injuries or violence were reported during the takeover. </p><p> <em>"There are no injured.

The people are demanding amnesty for all political prisoners, the holding of a referendum and making Russian also an official language. </p><p> <em>"We waited till 14:00 local time, the time we expected the reply by. No answer was received. Kiev has completely ignored our demands,”</em> Oleg Dereko told RIA Novosti. </p><p> Aleksey Uskoryakin, another protest leader, said the take-over was not planned. The protesters wanted to hold a rally and send a delegation to talk to regional MPs, but they were absent in the building. Emotions got the better of the situation, resulting in seizure of the building, in which several windows were broken. </p><p> The protesters are contemplating a possible release of the building, <em>“if the governor and lawmakers agree to negotiate.”</em> </p><p> Activists estimate there are over 3, 000 people remain outside the building and more continue to arrive. </p><p> <em>“There are over 3,000 people on the square. People are arriving; the square is filling up with people. The governor has not come out yet and no announcements have been made. Everyone is waiting for a response on the ultimatum, the deadline has passed already,”</em> Dereko told the news agency. </p><p> According to Dereko, a crowd of several thousand people has moved towards the local prosecutor’s office. <br><em>“Now we are going to the prosecutor's office. Many people, mostly those who were outside the regional administration, 10,000 thousand, probably,”</em> he said, adding that activists also plan to take control of the local police office on Tuesday. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155620-eu-japan-sanctions-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[EU ‘should be ashamed’ after sanctions on Russia - Moscow]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155620-eu-japan-sanctions-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fe/40/00/ashton.jpg" title="European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton  (Reuters / Jim Bourg)"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 12:06:28 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/fe/40/00/ashton.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Russian Foreign Ministry responded with a scathing statement to the EU’s new round of sanctions against Russia, saying Europe apparently has no insight into the political situation in Ukraine.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fe/40/00/ashton.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton  (Reuters / Jim Bourg)" /> <p> <em>“Instead of forcing the Kiev clique to sit down with south-eastern Ukraine to negotiate the country’s future political system, our partners are toeing Washington’s line to take more unfriendly gestures towards Russia,”</em> the statement declared. </p><p> <em>“If somebody in Brussels hopes to stabilize the situation in Ukraine by this, it is evidence of a total lack of understanding of the internal political situation in that country and invites local neo-Nazis to continue their lawlessness and thuggery towards the peaceful civilians of the south-east,”</em> the statement said. <em>“Are you not ashamed?”</em> </p><p> The reproof comes in response to EU’s unveiling a list of 15 names targeted by the union’s new round of sanctions against Russia over its stance on the Ukrainian political crisis. The move comes a day after a similar move by Washington, although the American sanctions targeted fewer people and are also aimed at some Russian companies. </p><p> The EU list includes Russian officials like Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, Chief of General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s new Minister for Crimean Affairs Oleg Savelyev and Crimea’s new Senator Olga Kovitidi. </p><p> It also target Ukrainian leaders of the protest movement in the east of the country, including Igor Strelkov, a Ukrainian militia commander in Slavyansk, who Kiev claims is actually a Russian military intelligence officer named Igor Girkin. Kiev failed to provide any proof of the claims, and its previous US-endorsed evidence of alleged Russian military presence in Ukraine proved to be false. </p><p> The Tuesday move brings to 48 the number of individuals targeted by European asset freezes and travel bans. </p><p> Unlike Washington, Brussels didn’t level sanctions against businessmen like Igor Sechin, the head of Russian energy giant Rosneft, who is reputed to have strong ties with President Vladimir Putin, but does not hold any office in the Russian government. </p><p> </p><p> The individuals targeted by the sanctions were calm and sarcastic about them, as was the case with the previous rounds of sanctions. </p><p> <em>“It’s such small thing that has no effect on my life or work that I could only say ‘stupid, but flattering’”</em> Savelyev told ITAR-TASS. </p><p> Russian Senate Speaker Valentina Matvienko, who was targeted by a previous round of personal sanctions, said Russia <em>“may thank the West, because with their actions they are consolidating further the Russian society, while Russia has enough resilience to respond to any possible damage from such sanctions.”</em> </p><p> In a separate move on Tuesday Japan issued visa bans on 23 people, expanding its own sanctions against Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry called the move <em>“clumsy”</em> and <em>“obviously taken under foreign pressure,”</em> adding that it would not go without a response. </p><p> The US and its allies are imposing more sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian individuals and companies in a bid to ramp up the cost of Moscow’s policy towards Ukraine. The West accuses Russia of deliberately escalating tensions in eastern Ukraine in a bid to undermine the authorities in Kiev, which are considered mostly illegitimate by Russia, but are supported by Western countries. </p><p> Russia sees the attitude as duplicitous, considering the support the US and the EU gave to anti-government protest in Kiev, which escalated into an armed coup that brought the current leadership of Ukraine into power. It also says Kiev is failing to do the necessary steps towards defusing the situation, namely disarming the nationalist militias which were the cornerstone of the coup, and calling off the military crackdown on the protest in the east. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155588-iraq-bloodshed-forthcoming-elections/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Elections, foreign involvement unlikely to improve situation in Iraq’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155588-iraq-bloodshed-forthcoming-elections/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fc/40/00/iraq.jpg" title="An Iraqi policewoman casts her ballot at a school in Baghdad on April 28, 2014 (AFP Photo / Ahmad Al-Rubaye) "/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 11:50:50 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fc/40/00/iraq.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The only way to improve situation in Iraq is through creation of true national unity inside the state that recognizes different religions and ethnicities, ensures that they have the stake in the political process,anti-war activist Eugene Puryear told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fc/40/00/iraq.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="An Iraqi policewoman casts her ballot at a school in Baghdad on April 28, 2014 (AFP Photo / Ahmad Al-Rubaye) " /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Sectarian and terror violence is plaguing Iraq, while the government's efforts to contain it seem to have failed. Why is that?</em> </p><p> <strong>Eugene Puryear:</strong> The fact right now in Iraq is that we see something like confessional system set up by the US occupation. They essentially did everything they could through the invasion to divide the country along ethnic and religious lines, so there is no real national government, even though Maliki is allegedly the head of government of the entire country, it’s clear that there is a number of sectarian and ethnic divides that exist inside of the country that are not bridged to political process. </p><p> So when the government acts, even if it claims that it is acting in the name of security, is in fact to the people in the west and people in the north often appears to be acting in the way that is oppressive or very dictatorial and not in a way that builds peace or consensus. </p><p> What we are seeing here is continued fruits of the US invasion that destabilized the country and the failed attempt to rebuild the country on the different auspices first with the colonial government and then later with the elections.

And we see that tensions in the country have been high for some time now and it’s unclear what exactly will happen but it is certainly possible that there could be violence and that with incidents that happened on Monday there is a prelude that certainly seems to point towards the fact that there could be more violence inside the country. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Do you think the forthcoming elections are likely to change the situation on the ground?</em> </p><p> <strong>EP:</strong> I don’t think so. I don’t think this election gets to the heart of the matter which is really a divide between different forces inside of the country, somewhere regionally but to a larger extent [around] sectarian, ethnic and religious lines. I don’t think certainly the election process has done anything to solve that so far, and we see that Maliki government has even deepened that in so many ways. So this election would continue to the same state of affairs that we have seen in the post-occupation face of Iraq, where the divides are not bridged by the elections and in fact violence continues as different fractions fight it up. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Is there any solution for Iraq to stop the bloodshed?</em> </p><p> <strong>EP:</strong> The only way we can do is to have true national unity inside of the country and this is of course very difficult because the American occupation raised tensions to such a high level. But what we have to see is the solution that bridges the gap, that recognizes that there are number of different people, religions and ethnicities inside of Iraq, that they all have to have the stake in the political process. The only way we can do that is to have a true national solution for a political force to emerge that is able to speak to all the different communities and certainly speak to them in such a way that their needs and desires are taken into account. </p><p> As long as we see politicians and political forces acting simply for narrow game by focusing on the lowest common nominator that is religious sector or ethnicity, then we will continue to see that there is no really just a religious sect in this case primarily but also ethnicity with the Kurds in the north. We will not be able to see any sort of true solution for this issue. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Do you think that with more international help the country would've been better off?</em> </p><p> <strong>EP:</strong> It depends on what the nature of that support was. There is quite a bit of international hope that came in the form of the military intervention and occupation. I think certainly that more international aid probably wouldn’t have solved the problem started by the occupation because the occupation created this problem of breaking the country apart and destabilizing the country. Had there been more international cooperation at the stages leading up to Iraq war in 2003 to avert war, we certainly wouldn’t have seen some of this happening. Once the occupation came in, the international forces are not going to be able to impose the situation on the outside. It’s going to be an internal Iraqi solution that has a national character. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> I<em>s progress towards a peaceful Iraq even possible with a Syrian civil war being waged by terrorists, amongst others, right across the border?</em> </p><p> <strong>EP:</strong> It certainly does make things worse, it created much more fertile ground for those, I guess some call them Al-Qaeda-type Islamists, Salafists, whatever you want to call them, it created more fertile ground for them to be able to recruit and draw forces in, to pursue their own political goals which don't at all involve being engaged into political process, but essentially waging war against Syrians and Iraqi state. </p><p> What we have seen here is that in Syria the US and other Western powers have stocked these groups by continuingly funding the occupation, which makes the security situation in Iraq more precarious as you have more weapons, logistics and other types of support flowing in to support Syrian rebels, many of whom are in these Islamist camps and ultimately create a very deadly situation because not only there is a violence across the border, but there is also support coming from the most powerful nations on Earth in terms of money, material and war machines that are going in there, making it much more difficult for the problems in Iraq to be contained. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>And vice versa, do you think terrorists in Syria are fuelled by Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups in Iraq?</em> </p><p> <strong>EP:</strong> Certainly. We have seen the groups unify across borders over the past several years here, so we can see that there is a shared emphasis among the number of these groups that fight under Al-Qaeda umbrella or under Al-Qaeda-affiliated umbrella whether in Iraq or Syria or any country around the world, there is a unified desire of these forces to go where the action is. This is original problem, not simply the one that is Iraqi or Syrian. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What kind of goals do those groups pursue?</em> </p><p> <strong>EP:</strong> It’s difficult to say, it seems that their goal is to create as much chaos and as much violence as possible in order to, I would assume, get other forces who disagree with them, to essentially bow to their dictate in order to stop the violence and completely submit and completely give in to what they want. So it seems to be a sort of pure terror strategy that tries to force others either to flee the region or completely submit to the dictate of these forces. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Who is to blame for the situation? The international community or maybe the US in particular?</em> </p><p> <strong>EP:</strong> I think they mostly are to blame. I don’t know what the US can do, what the international community can do. We’ve seen the US and other Western nations send a number of drones, hellfire missiles and things of that nature to Iraq. And in fact it just exacerbated the tensions against the Iraqi government and further inflamed the political situation there. </p><p> I think it’s very difficult for international forces to have some sort of effect because the political lines are drawn so sharply that when they come down on the side of the government, even those forces who are not in favor of Al-Qaeda, often take a negative view of the government action in the area, especially in Iraq, either towards civilians or sometimes is explicitly aimed at destabilizing groups that are not at the Al-Qaeda focused. </p><p> In Syria you have the situation when they are actually supporting many of the forces who embrace Al-Qaeda umbrella groups. The international community really needs to take a step back, not a step forward. Its attempts to assist by choosing sides in this have really only further sharpened the lines of contestation. If anything we need to take a step forward is towards trying to develop conciliatory diplomatic frameworks to attempt to provide a way for this forces inside of these nations to resolve their issues. </p><p> What we have seen in the past several years has been the civil war in Syria and the creation of these Al-Qaeda-related umbrella groups in Syria that are funded by the US and other Western nations has trickled over into the border and given even a new lease on life to these groups inside of Iraq, who previously had been more dormant and now are able to get more guns, more men, more money to carry out their goals. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155584-islam-weston-candidate-churchill/</guid><title><![CDATA[UK party leader arrested for quoting Churchill on Islam]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155584-islam-weston-candidate-churchill/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fc/00/00/winston-churchill.jpg" title="Sir Winston Churchill (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 11:22:45 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/fc/00/00/winston-churchill.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Quoting Winston Churchill can get you arrested, as one British candidate in the European elections found out after referring to the iconic wartime leader’s thoughts on Islam from his book ‘The River War’, published in 1899.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fc/00/00/winston-churchill.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Sir Winston Churchill (AFP Photo)" /> <p> The book chronicles young Churchill’s service in Sudan at the time of the Anglo-Egyptian re-conquest, and the passage deals with his observations on Islam. But that passage is now in danger of landing Liberty GB party Chairman Paul Weston in prison for two years. </p><p> Weston, a candidate in the May 22 European Elections in the South East, addressed the public in Hampshire on Saturday, speaking through a megaphone, letting loose on Muslims for their <em>“improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property,”</em> which <em>“exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> <em>“Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die, but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it,”</em> he went on. </p><p> <em>“No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith,”</em> he declared, sparking outrage in one spectator, who decided to bring in the police. </p><p> Authorities didn’t wait for Weston to finish his speech, taking him away from the steps of the Winchester Guildhall – first for refusing to comply with an order for public dispersal, then on the added charge of <em>“suspicion of religious or racial harassment,”</em> police told the newspaper. </p><p> <em>“He has been bailed pending further inquiries to report back to police on May 24,”</em> they said. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WB7en-eu0X8" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> The scene was handled by about <em>“six or seven officers”</em>, who asked the spectators questions before stopping Weston, mid-speech. He did not possess a permit for public addresses. </p><p> They talked to him for about 40 minutes, and at around 3pm took him downtown in a van, where he spent several hours in a cell. Later the dispersal notice was dropped, but Weston was then re-arrested for a racially aggravated crime, which, under the public order act, could land him a two-year sentence. </p><p> Liberty GB, outlining its ideas on its website, has as its core mission the promotion of views against immigration – something it calls <em>“the most important issues of our time,”</em> which the Liberal Democrats, Labour and Conservatives <em>“manifestly refuse to discuss”</em> – and the spread of fundamentalist Islam through British culture, whose traditional values they believe have been contaminated. Liberty GB believes that <em>“Britain could be a wonderful country again, but it will take politics bordering on the revolutionary to achieve this vision.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155576-blackwater-world-cup-training/</guid><title><![CDATA[World Cup war: Blackwater providing training to Brazil security forces]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155576-blackwater-world-cup-training/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fb/80/00/brazil.jpg" title="Reuters / Ueslei Marcelino "/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 11:22:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/fb/80/00/brazil.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The company formally known as Blackwater is helping provide security training in Brazil in the run up to the 2014 World Cup, stoking fears that the ‘pacification’ of the country’s slums is very much an Iraq-style military occupation.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fb/80/00/brazil.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Ueslei Marcelino " /> <p> According to the daily Folha D. S. Paulo, Blackwater, renamed "Xe Services" in 2009 and "Academi" in 2011, has been instructing Brazilian security forces at one of its private training facilities in North Carolina. </p><p> In a country that clocks up 50,000 murders a year, securing the $11-13 billion World Cup – the most expensive ever, is of primary importance. Violent anti-government protests erupted across Brazil last year, with demonstrators questioning why billions will be spent hosting the World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics rather than on vital public services. </p><p> On Monday, Brazil’s coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, said he was worried that street protests planned during the World Cup could hurt his team's chances of winning the title. Human rights campaigners have warned that proposed Brazilian anti-terrorism legislation could be used to clamp down on legal protests during the World Cup. </p><p> Writing for the Nation, Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff recently noted how Wikileaks revealed a 2009 cable from the US Embassy in Brasilia, which viewed crises spawned by sports mega-events as an optimal time to cash in. </p><p> <em>“After power outages rippled across Brazil in 2009, the US Mission wrote, ‘The newly heightened concerns about Brazil’s infrastructure as a result of this blackout, combined with the need to address infrastructure challenges in the run-up to the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, present the United States opportunities for engagement on infrastructure development as well critical infrastructure protection and possibly cyber security.’ In short, Brazil’s misery created room for opportunism.</em> </p><p> <em>The cable encouraged US government agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security ‘to explore these opportunities in the near-term.’ With Academi’s involvement in Brazil, this type of “opportunity” is taking shape.”</em> </p><p> It remains unclear how many of the 170,000 plus security personnel tasked with policing the World Cup have received training from Academi, or the exact dollar amount of the contract, though parallels between anti-insurgency operations in Iraq can already be seen in the pacification of the favelas or slums of Brazil. One April-23 report in the Spanish International news agency EFE notes that a group of 22 military officers and agents from Brazil's Federal Police "recently received training from US security firm Academi." </p><p> Blackwater gained worldwide notoriety for the substantial role it played in the Iraq war as a contractor for the US government. The firm became infamous for the alleged September-16-2007 <a href="http://rt.com/usa/judge-state-dept-blackwater-iraq-293/" target="_blank">shooting deaths</a> of 17 Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square, Baghdad. The attack, which saw 20 others wounded, was allegedly without justification and in violation of deadly-force rules that pertained to American security contractors in Iraq at the time. Between 2005 and September 2007, Blackwater security staff were involved in 195 shooting incidents. In 163 of those cases, Blackwater personnel were found to have fired first. </p><h2> Pacifying the favelas </h2><p> On April 5, 2,700 federal army troops occupied Rio de Janeiro’s sprawling Maré complex of favelas, taking over control from a military police contingent previously tasked with securing the area. The security forces will remain there until July 31, after the World Cup concludes. Mare, which covers an area of nearly 10 square kilometers and houses approximately 130,000 people, was effectively under the control of rival drug gangs prior to the operation. </p><p> <em>“There are two drug gangs and one militia. So it won’t be in two days, it won’t be in a year, that we bring peace,”</em> Luiz Pezão, the new governor of Rio, said following a meeting with the country’s president, Dilma Rousseff. </p><p> Soldiers have established checkpoints at the entrances to the favelas and patrol the streets on foot and in armored personnel carriers. Troops have also employed metal detectors and dogs to search for and sniff out hidden caches of weapons and drugs. </p><p> Apart from the deployment of soldiers, 37 "police pacification units" have been created since 2008 to police an area containing some 1.5 million people. </p><p> Residents initially welcomed the improvements in security, but fear law enforcement tactics have been heavy-handed. More than two dozen police face charges from a high-profile case in which a suspect died while being tortured by law enforcers. Last Tuesday, the Pavao-Pavaozinho favela <a href="http://rt.com/news/154260-rio-violence-olympics-police/" target="_blank">erupted</a> in violence after residents blamed police for the murder of Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira, a 26-year-old professional dancer. </p><p> Demonstrators from the favela set barricades of tires ablaze, leading to the closure of streets in the nearby tourist area of Copacabana. Pavao-Pavaozinho is only several hundred yards from where the Olympic swimming events are expected to take place in 2016. </p><p> O Globo newspaper, citing local health officials, reported that one resident of the favela was shot and killed during the melee, while another 12-year-old boy was shot and wounded. It remains unknown who fired the shots, and the police did not confirm the reports. </p><p> Amnesty International Brazil recently wrote that while the current operation provides the opportunity to show that public security is a right guaranteed to all, it warns that the favelas and outlying areas <em>“shouldn’t be treated as ‘enemy territory’ to be conquered, and the battle against criminal elements shouldn’t lead to the criminalization of the entire community – especially the youth.”</em> </p><p> The human rights organization further warns that the empowerment of military forces ill-prepared for policing could spark even greater abuses. </p><p> <em>“As the World Cup approaches, there’s a growing fear that this model – intervention by the Army and other security forces in the favelas – could be expanded, raising the threat of human rights violations and the militarization of daily life in the poorest communities. The armed forces have inadequate training for this type of operation, as well as little experience of engaging in dialogue with civil society and communities.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/155580-russia-internet-blogger-bill/</guid><title><![CDATA[Upper house passes new ‘blogger bill’ despite protests from industry, rights officials]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/155580-russia-internet-blogger-bill/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fb/c0/00/federation-council.jpg" title="Federation Council meeting.

" /> <p> The new bill introduces a definition of ‘blogger’ to Russian legislation. Popular blogs, defined as those that have 3,000 or more visitors per day, will have to register on a special list maintained by the consumer rights agency Rospotrebnadzor, and follow certain rules. </p><p> The authors will have to sign the posts with their real name and verify the information they publish. They will also be banned from posting extremist and terrorist information, propagating pornography or violence, and disclosing state or commercial secrets and personal data of citizens. Popular bloggers will not be able to use obscene language and will face some other restrictions, such as a ‘day of silence’ ahead of elections. </p><p> At the same time bloggers receive the right to make official inquiries and for commercial activities – they can have advertising in their posts and receive money for it. </p><p> The rules are enforced by the authorities through internet service providers who can be ordered to block certain bloggers for violations and provide information about the real people behind web aliases. Refusal to comply will be punished with fines of between 10,000 and 30,000 rubles ($270- $833) for individuals and between 50,000 and 300,000 rubles ($1400- $8300) for businesses. </p><p> The bill also introduces a special legal term for social networks, blog platforms and any sites with readers’ comments. They are called “distributors of information on the internet” and also face obligations to register with Rospotrebnadzor, store the user-generated content and logs of user activity for six months, and present the data to the state watchdog upon request. Refusal to comply will be punished by fines – from 3,000 to 5,000 rubles (US$83-$140) for private citizens, from 30,000 to 50,000 rubles ($833-$1,388) for officials, and from 300,000 to 500,000 rubles ($8,330-$13,888) for business entities. </p><p> The bill was dubbed by reporters as “<em>equating bloggers to mass media</em>,” but its authors and sponsors protested against such wording, saying that the bill only applied to popular blogs, while the websites already registered as mass media do not fall under its regulations. </p><p> The document has drawn a great deal of criticism from the internet industry, which was upset at being saddled with additional responsibilities without compensation. After it was passed by the lower house, Russian internet major Yandex closed the ratings of blogs in its search engine and also stopped indicating the number of readers for separate bloggers. </p><p> Popular blog platform Livejournal has also announced that it was hiding the statistics to help its users dodge the new regulations as they come into force. </p><p> However, the head of Rospotrebnadzor, Aleksandr Zharov, has called that move “<em>emotional</em>” and assured reporters that his agency would be able to obtain the data on popular bloggers without any help. </p><p> Shortly before the bill was forwarded to the upper house, the chair of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, addressed the Federation Council speaker with a request to reject it. Fedotov quoted procedure violations (the bill has not received the government approval which is necessary under constitution as it would require additional budgetary spending), but noted that the state regulation of blogs and social networks was a necessary thing. </p><p> To come into force the bill now has to be signed by the president and published. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155536-japan-imposes-sanctions-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Japan follows US sanctions with 23 visa bans]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155536-japan-imposes-sanctions-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f9/00/00/police.jpg" title="Reuters / Yuriko Nakao "/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 11:08:12 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f9/00/00/police.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Japan has imposed visa bans on 23 Russian citizens including government officials following US sanctions over Russia's stance on Ukraine.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f9/00/00/police.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Yuriko Nakao " /> <p> Japan has not released the names of those affected, but says the list is based on those compiled by the United States and the European Union, according to the Kyodo news agency. </p><p> "<em>We need to call on Russia to restrain itself and act responsibly,</em>" Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said. </p><p> Tokyo announced the measures following the decision on Monday by the United States and the European Union to impose <a href="http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/" target="_blank">additiona</a>l sanctions against Russia. </p><p> US President Barack Obama visited Japan last week to wrap up his four day Asia tour, meant to boost trade and business relations between Asia and Washington.

Shares tumbled to $14.95 by market close in New York on Monday, erasing all of the 2014 gains. </p><p> The error was sourced to Merrill Lynch, where lower-level employees botched the numbers they submit to the financial authorities for a quarterly securities filing. The gaffe also went undiscovered by the bank’s board of directors as well as PricewaterhouseCoopers, its external auditor. The US Federal Reserve also missed the blunder. </p><p> <a href="http://www.rt.com/business/us-banks-stress-test-860/" target="_blank">Stress tests</a>, called Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, are a way for the US Federal Reserve to assess whether financial intuitions have adequate capital. The protocol is part of the Dodd-Frank Act, which seeks to avoid a repeat of the 2008 collapse with precautionary regulations. </p><p> In March Bank of America passed its Federal Reserve stress test even though it provided faulty information. Citigroup Inc. was one of five banks that failed the test. According to Bank of America’s first quarter earnings report, it has $134 billion in Tier 1 capital, which has now been reduced to $130 billion. </p><p> <em>“Bank of America must address the quantitative errors in its regulatory capital calculations as part of the resubmission and must undertake a review of its regulatory capital reporting to help ensure there are no further errors,”</em> the US Federal Reserve said in a statement. </p><p> Bank of America scooped up Merrill Lynch, also a Wall Street investment giant, in January 2009 in the aftermath of the 2008 American financial crisis. Bank of America has been led by Brian Moynihan since 2010, who has been tasked with sorting out liabilities inherited from the acquisition. </p><p> In the first 3 months of 2013, the company reported a $276 billion deficit, the first quarterly loss under Moynihan’s tenure as CEO. </p><p> Bank of America has gained a bad reputation over its sloppy, and even sometimes illegal cooperate practices. In March, the bank was <a href="http://rt.com/business/bank-america-fine-regulator-569/" target="_blank">ordered to pay $9.5 billion</a> to the Federal Housing Finance Agency to resolve allegations that it misled investors over the quality of mortgage loan sales. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155564-euro-elections-candidate-ridiculous/</guid><title><![CDATA[Euro elections: Searching for President Nemo]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/155564-euro-elections-candidate-ridiculous/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fa/c0/00/eu.jpg" title="An European Union flag flutters outside of the European Parliament in Brussels (Reuters / Francois Lenoir)"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 08:56:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/25/fa/c0/00/eu.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​The European Parliament is at the most productive part of its four-year cycle.

As swathes of online videos demonstrate, most Europeans can’t recognize any of them. </p><p> Thus a form of false presidential election is being fought by three people who, frankly (having never seen them all in the same room), I suspect are the same man. These dull, wonkish candidates maintain a blithe regard to the fact nobody has ever heard of them. They are so similar that there is barely a cigarette paper of difference between them. (N.B. The previous sentence is in clear violation of EU ordinances as it could be construed as promoting smoking and also, heinously, endorses an alternative measurement system to metric). Classic machine politicians from the European lowlands, their position on the left-right scale is subsumed by Europhilia (they are all corporate socialists: adding ‘big’ to anything. Well, except <em>‘growth’</em>). </p><p> Most importantly, they all subscribe to one totalitarian overarching credo: whatever the issue, the only solution is more Europe. </p><p> </p><p> Given that this increasingly demented Europhilia has delivered two decades where Europe has appreciably underperformed both Asia and North America, those harboring a tinge of economic sanity might regard that as grounds for a change of plan alone. However, note the key point above, the only solution hard-wired into the Single Europhile Brain Cell is: more Europe. Resistance is futile. </p><p> Or maybe not. </p><p> Unsurprisingly, many voters, mired in the EU stasis of the north or the euro depression in the south, reckon Europe isn’t working. </p><p> This leading candidate trio includes Martin Schulz, a crazed center-left Europhile of old school socialist traditions, who, like the arguably even more fundamentalist Liberal Guy Verhofstadt, is forever fighting a self-perceived war against the bigotry of nationalism. The tricky bit is how bigoted they are when it comes to any of the multitude of justifiable criticisms against the fetidly corrupt Euro apparatus. If that sounds akin to a trip down totalitarian dogma memory lane, then far be it from me to differ. </p><p> Alongside a Saarland German, we have the (almost obligatory) line-up of former Belgian and Luxembourg prime ministers: Guy Verhofstadt and Jean-Claude Juncker respectively. Each is at the center of an electoral charade/conceit: criss-crossing Europe campaigning for a presidency which will eventually be decided at one of those lavish dinners where national leaders traditionally suspend democracy and the <em>‘Buggins’</em> turn’ system of proportional representation is deployed to allocate key posts. </p><p> Meritocracy is very much secondary to Europhilia in Brussels, as evidenced by Britain’s Cathy Ashdown, whose occupancy of the foreign portfolio has resembled an artless prank. Regardless of the <em>‘popular’</em> vote, expect the various presidents to be chosen via the usual behind closed doors botch up, as Mrs. Merkel has already clearly hinted. </p><p> Astute readers may wonder how growing Euroskepticism will influence the new parliament? In a direct swipe against democracy, the usual EU rules will apply: ignore the problem, ridicule the complaints and press for more Europe! Given that the answer is always <em>“More Europe!”</em> the three leading parties will suspend left-right ideological differences to concentrate on their single state delusion. </p><p> Given that the European Parliament could be 25, even 30 percent explicitly critical - if not outright skeptical - of the EU’s vast failings, readers may wish to ponder just how the EU can claim to have any remote attachment to the democracy it wishes to foist on others when its own process has become a travesty. </p><p> Meanwhile Europe continues to waste taxpayers’ money in the search for President Nobody. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155572-ryabkov-ukraine-south-crimea/</guid><title><![CDATA[Russia won't repeat 'Crimea scenario' in southeastern Ukraine - Russian Deputy FM]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155572-ryabkov-ukraine-south-crimea/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fb/40/00/ryabkov.jpg" title="Sergey Ryabkov (RIA Novosti / Andrey Stenin)&#10;"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 08:52:45 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/fb/40/00/ryabkov.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​Russia is not going to repeat “The Crimean scenario” in southeastern Ukraine, said the country’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fb/40/00/ryabkov.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Sergey Ryabkov (RIA Novosti / Andrey Stenin)
" /> <p> <em>“I think what happened in Crimea turned out to be a big shock for Western partners. They can’t tolerate it. And they see the same scenario in southeastern Ukraine,”</em> he told Gazeta.ru<strong>.</strong> </p><p> According to Ryabkov, the Kiev authorities should give people from southeastern Ukraine a chance to participate in shaping the future of their own country. </p><p> <em>“It’s a normal desire [to decide your country’s future].

Battisti, 53, was sold at a September 2011 tax sale to cover the paltry debt, which arose from an interest rate charge on Battisti’s 2009 tax bill. Beaver County auctioned off the house, with an estimated value of $280,000, selling it for $116,000 to SP Lewis. </p><p> <em>"I paid everything, and didn't know about the $6.30,"</em> she told AP. <em>"For the house to be sold just because of $6.30 is crazy."</em> </p><p> Battisti appealed the move, saying she didn’t know she owed the past due charge until she was notified that her home would be sold. Beaver Country court initially denied her evidentiary hearings on the case, but Battisti turned to the Commonwealth Court in Harrisburg, which in August 2013 ordered the county court to review the case. </p><p> Last week, County Judge C. Gus Kwidis ruled against Battisti, saying she had been properly notified of her debt and that the sale followed state law. In his six-page order, the judge said the former homeowner is entitled to $108,039 in proceeds from the sale after her tax obligations are met. </p><p> <em>“She's going to get that money, but she's going to lose her house. All the notice requirements were met,”</em> Kwidis said on Friday as cited by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. <em>“In tax assessment laws, even if I feel sorry for her, I can't do anything to help her. ... Everyone felt bad about it.”</em> </p><p> Battisti plans to appeal the ruling before the Commonwealth Court, she said. </p><p> Joe Askar, Beaver County's chief solicitor, said the judge got the decision right. </p><p> <em>"The county never wants to see anybody lose their home, but at the same time the tax sale law, the tax real estate law, doesn't give a whole lot of room for error either,"</em> Askar said. </p><p> Battisti’s lawyer Ed Santillan said his client would lose about $200,000 in equity if she accepts the sale proceeds and that she wants to keep her home. Battisti said Lewis, the new homeowner, has offered to return it to her for a “ridiculous” $260,000. </p><p> Lewis' attorney could not be reached for comments. </p><p> Despite the sale, Battisti and her three children were allowed to stay in the house while legal proceedings in the case are underway. </p><p> <em>“I'm going to fight it until my dying day,”</em> Battisti pledged. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155544-air-france-prostitution-sex/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Sex-traffic control: Air France exec, wife run prostitution racket worth millions]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155544-air-france-prostitution-sex/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f9/80/00/prostitite.jpg" title="AFP Photo DDP / Martin Oeser"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 08:52:31 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f9/80/00/prostitite.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />An executive at Air France used the airline to run a lucrative prostitution ring. The official, who was assisted by his wife, trafficked women from Brazil and subjected them to forced prostitution in trendy areas of Paris, local media reports.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f9/80/00/prostitite.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo DDP / Martin Oeser" /> <p> Alain D., the only name the 54 year-old is known by at this time, has been charged on Tuesday with his Brazilian wife, Claudia, 51, and another accomplice, also from Brazil. They stand accused of human trafficking, pimping and organized crime, according to a Saturday report by Le Parisien. The three are now being kept at prisons in Val-de-Marne and Essonne, police sources told the French newspaper. </p><p> The business had been generating 2 million euro a year since 2010. Alain D. had managed flight crews at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, and was in a position to get sizeable discounts on tickets he used to transport women back and forth between France and Brazil, according to vice squad detectives. </p><p> Trips for new flesh would take place every month. Each time the trio returned, they’d present the girls as relatives. This reaped the bonus of traveling for 150 euro per person - a privilege reserved for families of Air France employees. </p><p> A break in the case came when one of the women, a student from Brazil who had arrived for university studies in 2010, somehow managed to escape her captors and report the prostitution ring to the police three years later. She had apparently been forced to be a sex worker by Claudia D. </p><p> A police source told Le Parisien that <em>“Claudia D. had settled the young woman in an apartment on Rue de Rivoli in the 1st district, where she was to receive five customers per day. Sexual services were priced at up to 150 euro.”</em> It was actually the wife who was allegedly in charge of managing the sex network: placing online ads, setting up appointments and renting apartments for prospective clients. </p><p> To add insult to injury, the girls were coerced by Alain and Claudia to visit a <em>“guru with mystical powers”</em> – a self-styled spiritual therapist – and the third person charged in the case. This character was supposed to boost their self-confidence, alleviate the stress of their situation and help them settle into their new lives. </p><p> The 500 euro that the girls were allegedly forced to spend on each session essentially went back into the pockets of the accused. </p><p> The trio apparently lived large. They rented apartments in some of the most expensive areas and streets of the French capital, always trying to avoid detection by frequently changing accommodation. </p><p> A source with the vice squad has estimated the total turnover from the business since 2010 to be around 2 million euro annually and involving a dozen young girls. He told Le Parisien that <em>“this is an extraordinary case.”</em> </p><p> Air France was also contacted for comment, but offered none at the time. </p><p> According to police, there was another, final destination to which the money was being funneled. An investigation is underway. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155560-damascus-blast-killed-syria/</guid><title><![CDATA[12 killed, 50 injured in Damascus blast - state TV]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155560-damascus-blast-killed-syria/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fa/80/00/damascus.jpg" title="Reuters / Badra Mamet "/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 08:27:47 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://img.rt.com/files/news/25/fa/80/00/damascus.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Mortar shelling of central Damascus has killed 12 people and injured at least 50, Syrian state media reported.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/fa/80/00/damascus.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Badra Mamet " /> <p> The barrage of four mortar rounds hit Shaghour neighborhood of the Syrian capital, the SANA news agency said.

What's the point of the authorities handing down these sentences if they're not being put into force?</em> </p><p> <strong>Ahmed Naguib:</strong> Definitely, those pressure tactics that they have employed since June 30, 2013, those are intimidation tactics to both political dissidents at large and any voice of opposition, and specifically to the Muslim Brotherhood. We've seen in the verdict that was sentenced more than a month ago - for 529 people sentenced to death - we saw the court of appeals rescinded and revoked that sentence. Only 37 out of the 529 [were sentenced to death]. It's easy for the preliminary sentence to be so harsh because, politically, it serves as an intimidation tactic by the state towards the Muslim Brotherhood. But this definitely has not deterred the Muslim Brotherhood from continuing the protests. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The 6th of April youth movement was banned today. Why are they being targeted, do you think?</em> </p><p> <strong>AN:</strong> You have to understand that the 30th of June was not only a coup, but it was a revolution that was more or less used by the military generals and the deep state, the Mubarak regime, to become an anti-revolution movement. So now we're all being punished, one after the other, now that the Muslim Brotherhood - the largest opposition group to the Mubarak regime - has been sided away, and now the deep state is punishing one group after the other and targeting individuals who were in the front lines of the revolution from the very beginning. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The Muslim Brotherhood's leader was one of the people handed a death sentence today. Don't you think this will only mobilize pro-Morsi supporters?</em> </p><p> <strong>AN:</strong> Absolutely. If we see that, in the so-called presidential elections, General Sisi wins, escalated violence will be inevitable. On the other hand, [there will be] escalated crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and any voice of dissidence under the name or pretext of national security and war on terrorism. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Presidential elections are planned for near the end of May. Might this explain the ongoing crackdown?</em> </p><p> <strong>AN:</strong> Definitely. Not just that. You can see heightened targets of terrorism against the police. And that definitely could be explained to both tactics used by the military and intelligence community, as well as real terrorism. When you've imprisoned 20,000 people in six months, tortured 17,000, and killed 3,000, that definitely might harbor more violence. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>How do you see things panning out after the elections?</em> </p><p> AN: Not very well, because this crackdown will continue. The economic situation is very dire. The Saudi and Gulf financial support and subsidies cannot continue forever. So whomever will become Egypt's next president will be faced with a virtually impossible economic situation. And it's a country that in the past three years, has been substantially dependent on borrowing. The external debt jumped from 35 billion (Egyptian pounds) under Mubarak to over 55 billion currently. This continued borrowing only serves deficits in the budget and not income-generating activities. This means with continued political unrest, the economy will continue to suffer a major blow. Any president cannot deliver economic services to the society, which will inevitably continue the cycle of unrest and violence. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155516-nasa-star-coldest-ever/</guid><title><![CDATA[Coldest star ever found spotted by NASA infrared telescope]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155516-nasa-star-coldest-ever/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f7/c0/00/nasa-star-coldest-ever.jpg" title="WISE J085510.83-071442.5 was discovered through its rapid motion across the sky in two infrared images the WISE satellite taken six months apart in 2010.

The dwarf, officially known as WISE J085510.83-071442.5, is located 7.2 light-years away from our planet and, consequently, is the fourth-closest system from the sun. </p><p> “<em>It’s very exciting to discover a new neighbor of our solar system that is so close</em>,” Kevin Luhman, a Penn State astronomer, said in the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/nasas-spitzer-and-wise-telescopes-find-close-cold-neighbor-of-sun/#.U18UIPldVhH" target="_blank">NASA release</a>. “<em>And given its extreme temperature, it should tell us a lot about the atmospheres of planets, which often have similarly cold temperatures</em>.” </p><p> Unlike most stars, brown dwarfs do not give off enough light or heat to make them visible to the naked eye. NASA, using infrared telescope technology, was able to spot WISE J085510.83-071442.5. </p><p> Scientists eventually determined that the star’s temperature fluctuates between negative 54 degrees and 9 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it is the coldest star ever found. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Antarctica, comparatively, was minus 135.3 degrees, and the coldest temperature ever recorded in the US was minus 80 degrees on a 1971 day in Alaska. </p><p> WISE J085510.83-071442.5 is estimated to be between 3 to 10 times the mass of Jupiter. </p><p> By comparison, other brown dwarf stars discovered in the past have been approximately room temperature. </p><p> “<em>It is remarkable that even after many decades of studying the sky, we still do not have a complete inventory of the sun’s nearest neighbors</em>,” said Michael Werner, the project scientist for the Spitzer telescope at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in California. “<em>This exciting new result demonstrates the power of exploring the universe using new tools, such as the infrared eyes of WISE and Spitzer</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155500-turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult/</guid><title><![CDATA[Turkish journalist sentenced to 10 months for tweet ‘typo’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155500-turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/c0/00/turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Ozan Kose"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 02:25:22 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f6/c0/00/turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A Turkish journalist was sentenced Monday to 10 months in prison for a tweet that was critical of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a comment that he has described as a typing error.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/c0/00/turkish-journalist-sentenced-erdogan-insult.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Ozan Kose" /> <p> Önder Aytaç, a former police academy instructor who later became an influential columnist for Taraf, one of Turkey’s primary opposition newspapers, is also a member of the Gülen movement, which used to support the Erdogan government but is now against it.

ÖNDER AYTAÇ (@onderaytac) <a href="https://twitter.com/onderaytac/statuses/248853004369940480">September 20, 2012</a> </blockquote><p> The problem, according to Eynep Tufecki, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina, is that Aytaç attached the letter k to the end of “<em>ustam</em>.” </p><p> “<em>Aytaç added a letter, “k” to the word which transforms the end portion of the word to an off-color abbreviation, in effect writing ‘eff off.’ Erdogan sued under Turkey’s restrictive defamation laws which make it a crime to insult ‘public officials during the course of their job</em>,’” she wrote on <a href="https://medium.com/message/ad3d3c5e3c65" target="_blank">Medium</a>. </p><p> Aytaç later claimed the simple “k” was nothing more than a typo, and some observers have wondered if he would have been prosecuted if not for his nearly 200,000 Twitter followers. Yet average citizens were prosecuted for tweeting supportive messages when the Gezi Park protests were underway, and the Erdogan administration has a long history of trying to silence Twitter. </p><p> Aytaç received a suspended sentence, although it is not clear if his time behind bars was delayed or rendered meaningless. Because of the parameters of the law, though, the sentence he was given is not eligible to be equated into a fine or community service. </p><p> “<em>I’m quite a big man</em>,” he told the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/turkey-journalist-tweet-typo-pun/" target="_blank">Daily Dot</a>. “<em>My fingers are quite big as well. Sometimes you can’t properly hit all the letters</em>.” </p><p> Whatever the case, the punishment has already been condemned by international rights activists. </p><p> “<em>Irrespective of what [the tweet] says, nobody should be sent to prison for defamation/libel/insult</em>,” said Andrew Gardner, a Turkey researcher at Amnesty International. </p><p> Earlier this month the Turkish government convinced Twitter to block two accounts that leaked documents and phone calls embarrassing to the prime minister. Twitter declined to provide details about the users, although a cursory search of the two accounts – @Haramzadeler333 (which translates to “Son of Thieves”) and @Bascalan (“Prime Thief”) – proved they were indeed listed as “<em>withheld</em>.” </p><p> Erdogan previously sought to block YouTube and Twitter in March, after audio surfaced of a sensitive conversation between Turkish leaders regarding the security situation in Syria. The ban was instituted in the weeks before municipal elections. </p><p> The Twitter blackout was lifted on April 3, once the country’s highest court decided that the government rule was a direct violation of free speech. Two other rulings declared that YouTube should be unblocked for the same reason, although the video site is still unavailable to Turkish audiences. </p><p> Meanwhile Turkey’s <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-sues-gulen-linked-journalists-one-pundit-briefly-detained.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=64274&amp;NewsCatID=338" target="_blank">Hurriyet Daily News</a> reported Monday that Aytaç was briefly detained in Ankara on March 29 when government prosecutors reportedly suspected that he had been involved with leaking the audio about security in Syria, prompting the major social media crackdown. Prosecutor Tekin Küçük told Hurriyet officials had the “<em>impression</em>” Aytaç was involved in the disclosure and that the journalist was released after testifying he was not. </p><p> Turkish President Abdullah Gül said the leak was an “<em>act of espionage</em>” and vowed that those deemed responsible would be shown “<em>no tolerance</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155492-drone-victims-disclosure-senate/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Disclosure of drone-strike victims dropped from Senate bill]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155492-drone-victims-disclosure-senate/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/40/00/drone-victims-disclosure-senate.jpg" title="AFP Photo / John Moore"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 01:45:44 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f6/40/00/drone-victims-disclosure-senate.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />At the request of US Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, US senators have removed a section from a crucial intelligence bill that would have required the White House to disclose information on those killed by US drone strikes overseas.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/40/00/drone-victims-disclosure-senate.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / John Moore" /> <p> The fiscal year 2014 intelligence authorization bill passed through the Senate Intelligence Committee in November with a provision that required the president to offer annual statistics that outline the total number of <em>“combatants”</em> and <em>“noncombatant civilians”</em> killed or injured by US drone strikes in the previous year. </p><p> But at the behest of Clapper, Senate leaders have removed the requirement from the legislation ahead of the bill’s upcoming vote on the Senate floor, the Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/drone-civilian-casualties-senate-bill-feinstein-clapper?CMP=twt_fd&amp;CMP=SOCxx2I2" target="_blank">reported</a>. </p><p> Clapper asserted that more context is needed to accurately report these statistics to the public. Therefore, he told senators in a letter on April 18 the Obama administration is seeking other ways to disclose the casualty toll of their legally-dubious drone strike operations. </p><p> <em>“The executive branch is currently exploring ways in which it can provide the American people more information about the United States’ use of force outside areas of active hostilities,”</em> Clapper wrote to the top members of the Senate intelligence committee, Dianne Feinstein (D) and Saxby Chambliss (R). </p><p> <em>“To be meaningful to the public, any report including the information described above would require context and be drafted carefully so as to protect against the disclosure of intelligence sources and methods or other classified information. … We are confident we can find a reporting structure that provides the American people additional information to inform their understanding of important government operations to protect our nation, while preserving the ability to continue those operations,”</em> Clapper added. </p><p> The US government does not offer any insight into how many casualties have resulted from its covert drone-strike program that involves both Central Intelligence Agency and US Defense Department operations. Officials like Sen. Feinstein, seeking to salvage the status quo surrounding drone strikes despite deepening opposition worldwide, maintain that the number of civilian deaths from unmanned drone attacks is miniscule. </p><p> Several independent groups and journalism organizations attempt to track the number of people killed in the strikes, often using press and ground reports in the likes of Pakistan and Yemen to piece together casualty estimates. </p><p> The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, one of the most comprehensive sources for drone casualty figures, <a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/" target="_blank">estimates</a> that hundreds of civilians – at least – have perished in US drones strikes overseas. </p><p> For example, the Bureau has confirmed that drones have killed as many as 451 people in Yemen, including as many as 82 civilians. <em>"Possible"</em> – though unconfirmed – strikes have killed as many as 545 people total and as many as 45 civilians, the Bureau says. The number killed is far more in Pakistan, where an estimated 383 strikes since 2004 have killed as many as 3,718 people, and as many as 957 civilians, according to the Bureau. </p><p> Yet the US drone policy is so broad that it considers any military-age male in a strike zone as a combatant, especially if he is armed. Thus, even by the strictest standards, there are likely many more civilians who have died but were considered fighters or militants. </p><p> In addition to the high civilian casualty rates, critics say these drone strike policies are done in violation of international law, and question whether the Obama administration has the authority to sanction the killings without a court warrant. </p><p> One particular practice denounced by human rights activists is the use of so-called ‘signature strikes,’ in which a drone attack is launched based not on the identification of known Al-Qaeda fighters, but on the behavior of people. </p><p> In May 2013, amid criticism about US drone strikes overseas, President Obama said in a policy speech that <em>“before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured,”</em> adding that this is <em>“the highest possible standard.”</em> Though the latest strikes, among others, have caused <a href="http://justsecurity.org/2014/04/21/ongoing-drone-strikes-yemen-raise-questions/" target="_blank">analysts</a> to <a href="http://rt.com/usa/deadly-us-drone-strike-yemen-958/" target="_blank">question</a> whether the Obama administration’s supposed <em>“new rules”</em> for strikes are consistent at all. </p><p> The US has unofficially <a href="http://rt.com/news/pakistan-drone-strikes-taliban-657/" target="_blank">paused</a> its drone strike campaign in Pakistan, as negotiations continue between the Pakistani Taliban and the nation’s government. Yet strikes in Yemen have not stalled – nor has the official secrecy of the US that has marked its drone operations there. </p><p> Just over a week ago, <a href="http://rt.com/usa/drone-yemen-dozens-dead-880/" target="_blank">multiple</a> drone strikes in Yemen targeting so-called militants killed dozens of people, including some innocents. </p><p> In December, a US drone strike killed 15 members of a <a href="http://rt.com/news/yemen-strike-drone-wedding-161/" target="_blank">wedding</a> party, mistaking a procession of vehicles for a militant convoy. The group had been en route to the village of Qaifa, the site of the wedding, when it was hit. The assault left charred bodies strewn in the road and vehicles on fire, officials told AP. </p><p> Yemen is considered to be the top foothold for Al-Qaeda, and its affiliate there - Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) - is considered the militant network’s most active wing. The Yemeni government has asked the US for assistance in fighting terror threats, yet the entirety of negotiations between the US and Yemen is unknown. </p><p> Critics maintain that the drone strikes program in the country has done nothing to stem the growth of Al-Qaeda, and has even increased support for the terror network. </p><p> Human rights groups panned the decision to remove the transparency provision from the intelligence bill. </p><p> <em>“How many people have to die for Congress to take even a small step toward transparency? It's stunning that after all these years we still don't know how many people the Obama administration has killed with drones,”</em> said Zeke Johnson, director of Amnesty International’s security and human rights program, according to the Guardian. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155504-uk-france-baltic-jets/</guid><title><![CDATA[Britain, France deploy 8 fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155504-uk-france-baltic-jets/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f7/00/00/uk-france-baltic-jets.jpg" title="A Typhoon jet of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) (Reuters / Yiannis Nisiotis)"/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2014 01:25:01 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f7/00/00/uk-france-baltic-jets.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />UK and France deployed eight fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland to strengthen NATO air defense over the Baltic regions amid rising tensions in Ukraine, according to officials.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f7/00/00/uk-france-baltic-jets.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A Typhoon jet of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) (Reuters / Yiannis Nisiotis)" /> <p> Out of the eight planes, four UK Typhoon jets touched down in Lithuania and another four French Rafale jets landed in Poland’s northeast town of Malbork, UK and French defense ministries stated. </p><p> The additional jets in the area are to <em>“provide reassurance to our NATO allies in eastern Europe and the Baltic states,”</em> British Defense Minister Philip Hammond said. </p><p> <em>"In the wake of recent events in Ukraine, it is right that NATO takes steps to reaffirm very publicly its commitment to the collective security of its members,"</em> Hammond added. </p><p> The Polish city of Malbork has already received 70 French military personnel to support the new planes, according to French military spokesman Colonel Gilles Jaron. </p><p> Also on Monday, the US airborne division, which is to take part in NATO exercise 'Spring Storm' in May arrived in Estonia. Around 150 personnel arrived in the military transport aircraft to the Amari airbase, according to the country’s defense ministry. </p><p> Earlier, UK and France contributed AWACS early-warning aircraft to strengthen the fair defense system over Poland and Romania. </p><p> The United States announced last Tuesday that it is deploying 600 airborne troops on exercises in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as a show of solidarity with NATO members that border Russia and have been worried by the escalation of tensions. </p><p> In April, NATO said it will be increasing security in the Baltic region in light of escalating crisis in Ukraine.

Such eclipses are relatively common, with about four every five years. The last occurred in May 2013. </p><p> What makes this eclipse – the first of 2014 - unusual is that it is non-central, meaning that the center of the Moon’s shadow will not fall on Earth, instead passing above the Southern Hemisphere sky. </p><p> </p><p> Of 3,956 annular eclipses calculated to have happened or scheduled to happen between 2,000 BC and 3,000 AD only 68, or 1.7 percent, are non-central annular eclipses. This is only the third such event since the 17th century. </p><p> As most of the shadow was set to miss Earth – the perfect spot to watch the eclipse at its most symmetrical would have been above the planet . The only place where the “ring of fire”, or annulus, can be seen at all is in Antarctica. The spot is half way between the Dumont d’Urville and Concordia stations – located 1,100 km apart – meaning that in all likelihood no human was able to witness the unusual phenomenon. <br><br> "<em>This is a thoroughly bizarre eclipse,"</em> said a statement from Bob Berman, an astronomer with the Slooh Space Camera, which broadcasts astral events online. </p><p> <em><br> “As we will watch in real time as the inky black hemisphere of the moon partially obscures the sun, the greatest thrill might be an awareness of what's occurring — unseen by any human — in a tiny region of Antarctica."</em> <br><br> For sentient observers, due to the imperfect angle of observation the phenomenon wouldn't <em>"look any different from a normal, partial eclipse,"</em> Stephen Hughes told Australian Associated Press. A partial eclipse occurs when the Sun and the Moon do not fully align, so that the latter blocks out only a chunk of the former. </p><p> <br> About half the Sun was covered when the eclipse passed Sydney, and more than two thirds over Melbourne. <br><br> "<em>Melbourne will be quite a bit better than Sydney ... a super-fat banana,"</em>Hughes said before the event. <br><br> The eclipse could also be perceived in southern Indonesian islands. </p><p> NASA published an interactive <a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2014Apr29Agoogle.html"> map</a> that allowed Australasian residents to see when the eclipse passed through their area, but as usual, amateur sky-watchers were instructed to avoid looking at the Sun without protective equipment. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155472-death-row-inmate-innocent-study/</guid><title><![CDATA[1 in 25 death row inmates is likely innocent - study]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155472-death-row-inmate-innocent-study/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f5/00/00/death-row-inmate-innocent-study.jpg" title="AFP Photo / John Moore"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 23:57:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f5/00/00/death-row-inmate-innocent-study.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A new study estimated that no less than four percent of the approximately 3,000 US prisoners waiting to be put to death are in fact innocent of the crimes they committed, a shocking number that is far less than the inmates who are freed before execution.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f5/00/00/death-row-inmate-innocent-study.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / John Moore" /> <p> Researchers and legal experts from Pennsylvania, Michigan, and elsewhere around the country came together to examine the so-called “<em>dark figure</em>” that underscores the death penalty debate: how many of the people sentenced to die for their crime are actually innocent? </p><p> The result, a peer-reviewed analysis <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/04/23/1306417111" target="_blank">published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States</a>, is described as a “<em>deliberately conservative</em>” number which makes clear that wrongful convictions are not as uncommon as many would like to believe. </p><p> Legal teams determined that if all of those wrongfully convicted had their sentences cleared, the exoneration rate would jump from its current 1.6 percent to no less than 4.1 percent. By that logic, around 340 prisoners should have been released over the 30 years analyzed in the study, whereas only 138 were exonerated in that time. </p><p> “<em>This is a disturbing finding</em>,” Samuel Gross, a law professor at the University of Michigan law school and the lead author of this study, told <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent" target="_blank">the Guardian</a>. “<em>There are a large number of people who are sentenced to death, and despite our best efforts some of them have undoubtedly been executed</em>.” </p><p> The 4.1 percent is higher than previous estimates, although the researchers are confident that their method of “<em>survival analysis</em>” research was effective. The technique employs a variety of statistical devices to calculate the proportion of cases of so-called hidden innocence. To remain unbiased, they also used “<em>sensitivity analysis</em>” to determine how many exonerated convicts were in fact guilty. </p><p> “<em>If you look at the numbers in our study, at how many errors are made, then you cannot believe that we haven’t executed any innocent person – that would be wishful thinking</em>,” Smith said. </p><p> Statisticians investigating the matter were unable to accurately determine how many innocent men and women were executed, yet they took exception with a claim from US Supreme Cout Justice Antonin Scalia, who previously suggested that criminal convictions have an “error rate of 0.27% - or, to put it another way, a success rate of 99.973%.” </p><p> “<em>That would be comforting, if true</em>,” the study authors wrote. “<em>In fact, the claim is silly</em>.” </p><p> Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told journalist Ed Pilkington that “<em>every time we have an execution, there is a risk of executing an innocent person. The risk may be small, but it’s unacceptable</em>.” </p><p> Gross and his fellow academics said more prisoners than the number who were executed seem to have fallen between the cracks. In the years from 1993 to 2004 about 2,675 people were taken off death row when questions about their conviction were raised. That total represents more than one-third (36 percent) of all people sentenced to death over those three decades. </p><p> Instead of being exonerated, though, many of those thousands of people were given new sentences (more often than not life without parole) that will ensure their death behind bars anyway. Their situation is in some ways even more precarious because no longer being under threat of execution means they are no longer seen as a priority in the system, either by judges, prisoner advocate groups, or the department of corrections itself. </p><p> “<em>The best efforts of the judicial system are only devoted to prisoners when they faced execution</em>,” Gross explained. “<em>In many cases when people are released from death row, little or nothing is done to deal with the equally bad injustice they now faced – that they will spend the rest of their lives in prison for a crime they didn’t commit</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155496-tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi/</guid><title><![CDATA[TV crew evacuates LIVE on air as Mississippi tornado cuts broadcast (VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155496-tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/80/00/tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi.jpg" title="Screenshot from youtube.com @lucwise"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 23:24:53 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f6/80/00/tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />On Monday, a tornado tore through Tupelo, Mississippi in the northern part of the state at about 3 p.m., forcing staff at a local news broadcaster to seek shelter.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f6/80/00/tv-crew-evacuates-tornado-mississippi.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Screenshot from youtube.com @lucwise" /> <p> WTVA in Tupelo was on the air, giving its viewers the latest information on the dangerous funnel cloud when it touched down.

The company <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=8,078,349.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8,078,349&amp;RS=PN/8,078,349"> filed for a patent</a> for <em>“transitioning a mixed-mode vehicle to autonomous mode”</em> in May 2011. At that point, Google had already been testing its fleet of driver-less Toyota Prius and Audi TT models for several years, logging 160,000 miles with limited human input and more than 1,000 miles without driver involvement, BBC News reported in 2011. </p><p> Google’s current fleet of more than two dozen Lexus hybrid SUV’s meanwhile have traveled over 7000,000 miles in self-driving mode, the Associated Press reports. </p><p> Chris Urmson, the director of the Self-Driving Car Project, says in a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-latest-chapter-for-self-driving-car.html"> blog post</a> that the project, part of the company’s <a href="http://rt.com/news/google-x-secret-lab-353/" target="_blank">secretive Google X lab</a>, has focused on the chaos of city driving over the past year. <em>“As it turns out, what looks chaotic and random on a city street to the human eye is actually fairly predictable to a computer. As we’ve encountered thousands of different situations, we’ve built software models of what to expect, from the likely (a car stopping at a red light) to the unlikely (blowing through it).</em> </p><p> <em>“We still have lots of problems to solve, including teaching the car to drive more streets in Mountain View before we tackle another town, but thousands of situations on city streets that would have stumped us two years ago can now be navigated autonomously,”</em> Urmson writes. </p><p> Four states (California, Florida, Michigan and Nevada) allow for driver-less cars, The Atlantic Cities reports. Washington, DC announced new rules at the beginning of April that would make it the first jurisdiction to license self-driving car operators (rather than testers), according to Slate. And the federal government has authorized only a handful of test locations for “connected cars,” where vehicles use technology to communicate with other similarly equipped vehicles that alert drivers to potentially dangerous situations. </p><p> <em>“One of our goals is to drive fatality rates down to zero. Last year there were over 900 people killed on Michigan roadways. If we can get cars that refuse to crash, we can save those 900 people,”</em> Kirk Steudle, director of the Michigan Department of Transportation, told <a href="http://fox17online.com/2014/02/24/michigan-leads-the-worlds-research-on-driverless-cars/#oYoJiPpJf3EoZOsP.99"> Fox 17 in West Michigan</a>. </p><p> A recent rider in one of Google’s limited demonstrations of highway road tests believes the self-driving cars are safer. <em>“After a couple minutes you forget the car is driving itself. It's smooth, patient, and cautious,”</em> the rider wrote in an e-mail to RT. <em>“It will take time to understand how self driving cars fit into our cities, on our highways, and in our homes, but from a safety perspective I think this is a huge step in the right direction</em>." </p><p> The rider believes Google is uniquely poised to develop an autonomous car. <em>“Self-driving cars aren't an automotive challenge, they’re a data and computational challenge. Google is very good at predictive behavior, which is what a self driving car needs to do in order to decide if another car (or pedestrian or biker) is going to pose a ‘threat’ to it.”</em> </p><p> The car is covered in sensors - including radar and lasers - that create 3D maps of the self-driving car’s surroundings in real time. Then Google’s software sorts that information into four categories: moving vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and static objects like signs, curbs and parked cars. The technology has advanced far enough that it can distinguish individuals in a group on a corner, construction zones and the likely movements of cyclists, Google spokeswoman Courtney Hohne told AP. </p><p> Google says its goal is to get the technology to the public by 2017, but it has not said how it will market the technology. Options include collaborating with major carmakers or giving away the software, as the company did with its Android operating system. Google co-founder Sergey Brin told the Wall Street Journal that the company plans to partner with automakers to implement the technology, rather than manufacturing its own cars. </p><p> Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota and Audi had unveiled autonomous cars by October 2013, the Consumer Electronics Association says. At the group’s annual International Consumer Electronics Show in January, BMW and Audi both unveiled their latest driverless models, complete with demonstration drives, according to CNN. Renault-Nissan’s CEO hopes to have a model on sale by 2020, AP reports. </p><p> Driverless cars are not just about providing a safer ride, however. They may also allow people who are currently physically unable to drive to be able to run errands on their own. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cdgQpa1pUUE?feature=player_embedded" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> <em>“Where this would change my life is to give me the independence and the flexibility to go both the places I want to go and need to go when I need to do those things,”</em> Steve Mahan, Google’s self-driving car user #0000000001, says in a promotional video for the company.

Iraqi soldiers and security force members were out to cast ballots Monday ahead of the general election on Wednesday. </p><p> In the western Mansour district of Baghdad, six police were killed and 16 others were wounded when a suicide attacker dressed as a police officer detonated explosives near the entrance of a school used as a polling place, according to police and medical sources. </p><p> In Adhamiya, an east-central district of Baghdad, a suicide bomber killed four soldiers and wounded seven at a polling place. </p><p> Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki is running for a third term in the election, though he faces violent opposition amid political opponents seeking to reclaim power from the Shiite-dominated government. </p><p> A leading source of aggression against the government comes from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), formerly associated with Al Qaeda before ties were severed over ISIL’s rogue actions. ISIL has fought for control over western Anbar province with their sights set on the capital, Baghdad. </p><p> ISIL has threatened other Sunnis in Iraq with death should they vote in the upcoming election. In northern Iraq, where ISIL has fought vigorously against security forces, at least 10 police officers were killed. </p><p> In Tuz Khurmatu, 55 miles (89 km) south of the northern city of Kirkuk, a suicide attacker in a police uniform killed three policemen and wounded nine near a polling station, police said. Sunni fighters have attacked the area many times, as it is home to the Shiite Turkmen minority. </p><p> In Kirkuk, another bomber in a police uniform killed six police near a voting outlet. </p><p> In Hawija, 40 miles (70 km) southwest of Kirkuk, one soldier was killed and four wounded by a suicide attacker in an army uniform near a polling center, police said. </p><p> A curfew is set to go into effect on Tuesday night before polls open for Iraqi citizens on Wednesday. </p><p> In the first three months of 2014, 1,666 civilians were killed from acts of terrorism or violence, <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1812:un-casualty-figures-for-march-2014-anbar-province-excluded&amp;Itemid=633&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">according</a> to the United Nations.

He also unequivocally refuted baseless accusations that there are Russian sabotage and spy teams, purportedly destabilizing the situation in the south-east of the country,”</em> said a statement from the Russian defense ministry. </p><p> Instead, Shoigu classed the growth of NATO activity in Eastern Europe as “<em>unprecedented</em>”, saying it was accompanied by <em>“provocative”</em> rhetoric about <em>“containing”</em> Russia. </p><p> According to the Russian statement, Hagel expressed <em>“extreme concern”</em> about the situation in Ukraine on behalf of Brussels and Washington, and said that NATO’s actions in Europe intend to demonstrate the unity and defensive capability of the alliance, and have “<em>no provocative or expansive aims”.</em> </p><p> “<em>There is nothing new for Russia in all of this</em>,” Hagel, who assumed the role of Secretary of Defense last year, told Shoigu. </p><p> The Russian minister defended Moscow’s decision to announce military exercises near the Ukrainian border last week. </p><p> “<em>As soon as the Ukrainian authorities said that they were not going to use regular troops against unarmed civilians, Russian units were re-stationed in their usual bases,</em>” said Shoigu. </p><p> Shoigu accused Kiev of deploying more than 15,000 personnel, 80 tanks, 130 armored vehicles, and 60 artillery guns in the east of the country, “<em>under the pretext of ‘fighting terrorism’.”</em> </p><p> On Monday, NATO continued to <a href="http://rt.com/news/155504-uk-france-baltic-jets/" target="_blank">increase</a> its presence in the Baltic regions as UK and France deployed eight fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland to strengthen NATO air defense amid rising tensions in Ukraine, according to officials. </p><p> Out of the eight planes, four UK Typhoon jets touched down in Lithuania and another four French Rafale jets landed in Poland’s northeast town of Malbork, UK and French defense ministries stated. </p><p> The additional jets in the area are to <em>“provide reassurance to our NATO allies in eastern Europe and the Baltic states,”</em> British Defense Minister Philip Hammond said. <em>"In the wake of recent events in Ukraine, it is right that NATO takes steps to reaffirm very publicly its commitment to the collective security of its members,"</em> he added. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155484-tupelo-mississippi-tornado-large-damage/</guid><title><![CDATA[Large tornadoes sweep across Mississippi causing deaths and major damage]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155484-tupelo-mississippi-tornado-large-damage/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f5/c0/00/tornado-3.jpg" title="A man walks by the Steak Escape and Sleep Inn along North Gloster Street after a tornado went through Tupelo, Mississippi April 28, 2014.

The possibility of Russia exporting 500 megawatts of electricity to Iran is also on the cards, said Mehr. <br><br> The strengthening of economic ties between the two countries is of heightened significance given both economic sanctions on Iran, imposed with the aim of encouraging Iran to cut its uranium stockpiles, and new economic sanctions on Russian officials imposed on Monday. <br><br> On Sunday, Chitchian reportedly stressed <em>“the need for further expansion of economic ties between Tehran and Moscow, particularly in the energy and commerce spheres</em>,” stated Mehr. <br><br> Moscow has additionally been discussing the trade of 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil for Russian goods with Tehran. The protracted deal, first reported at the beginning of April could be worth as much as $20 billion, and has rattled Washington because it could bring Iran's crude exports above one million barrels a day - the threshold agreed upon in the nuclear deal between the P5+1 powers - US, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany – and Iran. <br><br> Moscow and Tehran are far from finalizing the contract, according to Russian business daily Kommersant, which first broke the news. Nonetheless, the Obama administration has expressed distaste at the reports. <br><br> Tehran’s ambassador to Moscow Mehdi Sanaei said on Friday that the implementation of Iran-Russia energy agreements hold the key to economic expansion. <br><br> Sanaei underlined the importance of promoting of Iran-Russia cooperation and called for the implementation of oil, gas and electricity deals, according to Press TV. <br><br> Russia-Iran trade is currently worth $5 billion a year, but economists say the two countries can at least quadruple the volume of trade. </p><p> Earlier this month, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said the Islamic Republic is determined to raise the volume of its “<em>economic transactions”</em> with Russia. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155460-us-intel-officers-iraq/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pentagon quietly sends more intelligence officers to Iraq]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155460-us-intel-officers-iraq/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/40/00/us-quietly-sends-more-intelligence-officers-to-iraq.jpg" title="AFP Photo / US Army"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 20:21:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f4/40/00/us-quietly-sends-more-intelligence-officers-to-iraq.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The United States is reportedly increasing the number of intelligence officers deployed to Iraq amidst new waves of violence there being attributed to jihadists from the group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/40/00/us-quietly-sends-more-intelligence-officers-to-iraq.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / US Army" /> <p> On Friday, Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/25/us-usa-iraq-security-idUSBREA3O1YZ20140425" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Pentagon has sent an entire team of high-level American intelligence agents abroad in order to investigate reports of growing insurgency, citing two current and one former US officials familiar with the matter. </p><p> The officials, Reuters claimed, believe the ISIL “<em>now boasts territorial influence stretching from Iraq's western Anbar province to northern Syria.”</em> </p><p> An Al-Qaeda offshoot, the ISIL has for years been working towards imposing Sharia law in the parts of Iraq that are typically Sunni-majority regions. In recent days, however, those efforts have been linked to grave acts of violence that have killed dozens just over the weekend. </p><p> By Saturday, the Associated Press had <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/suicide-attack-iraq-kills-least-11-people-093405645.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that the ISIL was claiming responsibility for a bombing one day earlier that left no fewer than six people dead. The following day, ISIL was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/suicide-attack-iraq-kills-least-11-people-093405645.html" target="_blank">attributed</a> with taking the lives of 33 after an attack was waged at a political rally for a hardline Shiite group known as Asaib Ahl Al-Haq. </p><p> <em>"The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant considers the Asaib Ahl al-Haq as its enemy and that's an honor for us,"</em> the leader of the Shiite group — Qais Al-Khazali— said at a news conference, according to the AP. <em>"Our blood will not have been shed in vain and what happened will not go unpunished."</em> </p><p> But as Iraq prepares for its first elections next week since the withdrawal of American troops in 2011, further violence is likely to be seen in the coming days — once again calling into question the effectiveness of the lengthy US-led military mission there that was touted as spreading democracy, not disruptions. </p><p> According to Reuters, around 100 US military personnel have remained in Iraq since the formal exit two years ago, but now an unknown number of intel agents have been deployed there to try and determine what could arise next if fighting between groups continues. </p><p> Government sources who spoke of the deployment to Reuters declined to be identified, and a spokesperson for the White House did not respond to the agency’s requests for comment. One source told Reuters that senior US policy officials met in Washington, DC last week to discuss further action in the region, but was not sure of the outcome of the meeting. </p><p> In a separate report published over the weekend, AP journalists wrote that the United Nations believes fighting in Iraq last year claimed some 8,868 people — a tally that hasn’t been seen since the height of the US-fought war there that ended in 2011. According to the UN, more than 1,400 people have been killed in Iraq during the first two months of 2014, and violence has only intensified in recent weeks. </p><p> Ned Parker — Reuters’ Baghdad bureau chief — told National Public Radio over the weekend that the latest events are likely only a sampling of what could be seen in Iraq next. </p><p> <em>“Iraqis are anticipating violence. What happened on Friday, the bombing at the Asaib Ahl Al-Haw political rally, was really a warning, an omen of what could happen. The government has declared a week holiday for the elections and there will be a curfew.

Total was the first major oil company to make incursions into Britain with the intention of seeking shale gas profit. <br><br> The company has a 30 million pound ($50 million) holding in two exploration ventures in the northeastern county. <br><br> West Sussex County Council has some indirect investments in both Cuadrilla and3.5 million pounds in Centrica. The southern county was the site of ongoing protests in Balcombe last summer, which residents reported ‘scarred’ and ‘divided’ the village’s inhabitants after considerable opposition erupted when Cuadrilla announced proposals to drill in the county. <br><br> The council stated that its investment equated to some 0.001 percent of the total value of its £2.45bn pension fund. <em>“Any indirect investments made by the pension fund’s investment managers would not have any influence at all in determining a planning application,”</em> the council said in a statement to the paper. <br><br> Last Wednesday, Cuadrilla Resources said that it is continuing to consult with residents on proposals for two shale gas exploration sites in the Fylde area of Lancashire in northwest England. <br><br> The Greater Manchester Pension Fund (GMPF) invests on behalf of Salford and Trafford councils. The area is being tested currently for shale gas by a company named IGas. The IGas group was invested in by the Henderson group, which itself has GMPF as a shareholder. <br><br> Each body contacted by the paper maintained that the investments did not constitute a conflict of interest. However, environmental activists have voiced outrage. <br><br><em>“It’s a worrying discovery. Fracking is already a dirty enough industry without getting mired in the murky waters of conflicts of interest. Councils must disinvest and show local voters that they can be trusted to put the interests of their constituents first when making crucial decisions on fracking applications,”</em> Simon Clydesdale, energy campaigner for Greenpeace UK, told the Independent. <br><br> Lincolnshire’s assistant director of resources, David Forbes, stated: <em>“The pension scheme operates within a set of clear investment principles and is overseen by the pension committee, which makes its decisions independently from the county council.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155416-uk-barclays-libor-probe/</guid><title><![CDATA[US-based ex-Barclays staff charged by UK in Libor scandal]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155416-uk-barclays-libor-probe/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f1/80/00/uk-barclays-libor-probe.jpg" title="Reuters/Toby Melville"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:24:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f1/80/00/uk-barclays-libor-probe.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK filed its first criminal proceedings against scandal-struck US-based Libor traders on Monday over the alleged rigging of global benchmark interest rates.

The lawyers for the remaining two men were not available for comment, reported Reuters. <br><br> While the SFO confirmed that the trio are in the US, they are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court in London on May 27. The occasion could set the ball rolling for the first extradition to the UK from the US in what has been a lengthy investigation into Libor (London interbank offered rate) manipulation. <br><br> The Libor scandal dates back to 2005. Libor is the average interest rate that underpins trillions of dollars worth of loans, contracts and mortgages through the interest rates of major London banks. The scandal drew in some of the world’s biggest financial institutions, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, and Barclays. <br><br> Barclays was the first bank to settle in the wake of the rate manipulation accusations, paying some $450 million in fines in 2012 after admitting misconduct. <br><br> The subsequent backlash forced out four top Barclays directors, including chief executive Bob Diamond in 2012, who had previously insisted that he would not resign. <br><br> So far, US and European authorities have fined 10 banks and brokerages a total of $6 billion. <br><br> Twelve people are now facing criminal charges in the US and UK, among them the three from Barclays for the manipulation of denominated Libor. Twenty-two potential co-conspirators have also been identified, but not publicly named. <br><br> The charges fall at a time when a parallel investigation is underway into foreign exchange market rigging. On March 5, the Bank of England was forced to suspend a member of staff. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155452-russia-ukraine-political-repressions/</guid><title><![CDATA[Moscow slams Kiev over 'political repressions']]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155452-russia-ukraine-political-repressions/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/c0/00/1russia-ukraine-political-prisoners.jpg" title="Anti-Kiev activists hold Russian flags and shout slogans during a rally outside a regional television station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on April 27, 2014 (AFP Photo / Alexander Khudoteply)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:24:45 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f3/c0/00/1russia-ukraine-political-prisoners.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Moscow is “extremely concerned” by the Kiev regime’s “political repression and persecution” against those who dare express opposition, the Russian Foreign Ministry said calling for the release all political prisoners.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/c0/00/1russia-ukraine-political-prisoners.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Anti-Kiev activists hold Russian flags and shout slogans during a rally outside a regional television station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on April 27, 2014 (AFP Photo / Alexander Khudoteply)" /> <p> <em>“Mass media reports give us reason to speak of the start of a ‘witch hunt’, mass prosecution of dissidents and political repressions and persecutions against those who dare disagree with the Maidan [coup-imposed] authorities,”</em> Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. </p><p> It particularly recalled the case of recently arrested “people’s governor” of Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev. </p><p> <em>“We are seriously concerned about the condition of Pavel Gubarev elected ‘a people’s governor’ of Donetsk,”</em> the ministry said, adding that he was abducted, charged with organizing mass unrests and attempting to divide Ukraine, and tortured. He went on <a href="http://rt.com/news/154872-gubarev-protest-ukraine-slavyansk/" target="_blank">hunger strike</a> against Kiev’s crackdown on protesters in Slavyansk, eastern Ukraine. </p><p> According to the Ministry, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Red Cross, managed to get access to Gubarev and visit him in prison on April 26, following “insistent calls” by Russia. The organizations confirmed the abovementioned situation. </p><p> <em>“Pavel Gubarev is not the only political prisoner of the Kiev regime,”</em> the statement stressed. </p><p> Citing local mass media, the Ministry also said that Moscow is seriously worried by reports about the construction of large temporary detention centers for thousands of people in Ukraine, allegedly for illegal migrants. </p><p> <em>“There is no such large number of illegal migrants in Ukraine, and buildings that are being erected, according to media reports, are very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps. The question arises, whether the Kiev regime plans to drive together dissenting citizens there from the South-Eastern regions of the country,”</em> the ministry said. </p><p> If true, all that <em>“does not accord”</em> with the norms of the OSCE and the European Council as well as obligations to amnesty political prisoners and participants in the protests, which Kiev agreed to during the four-party talks on Ukraine in Geneva on April 17. </p><p> <em>“Russia calls for the immediate release of [Donetsk Region people’s governor] Pavel Gubarev and other political prisoners of the Kiev regime,”</em> the Ministry said. </p><p> It has urged the European Council, OSCE and international rights organizations to condemn in the strongest possible terms the violations of human rights in Ukraine and to press for an end to political repressions in the country. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155456-cop-wife-killed-brandon-majewski/</guid><title><![CDATA[Cop's wife kills bicyclist, then sues him for ‘emotional distress’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155456-cop-wife-killed-brandon-majewski/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/00/00/ontario-teenager-brandon-majewski-sued.jpg" title="Brandon Majewski (Image from facebook.com)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:23:07 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f4/00/00/ontario-teenager-brandon-majewski-sued.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A Canadian woman who hit three teenage boys – killing one and seriously injuring another – is now suing the deceased child, his family, and the two other teenagers she struck for more than $1 million.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f4/00/00/ontario-teenager-brandon-majewski-sued.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Brandon Majewski (Image from facebook.com)" /> <p> In October 2012, 17-year-old Brandon Majewski was out with his friends Richard McLean and Jake Roberts, both 16, when they decided to hop on their bikes and go out for a hot dog. On their way, Sharlene Simon, 42, struck all three of the boys with her SUV. Majewski was severely injured, and died just two hours later. </p><p> Majewski’s father, Derek Majewski, acknowledged to the Toronto Sun that the boys shouldn’t have been out so late – it was past 1 a.m. at the time of the collision – but said they are <em>“good kids”</em> and should not have been hit by the vehicle. Now that the woman behind the vehicle is suing his dead son for emotional issues, anxiety, and trauma, he was not shy about expressing his anger. </p><p> <em>“I feel like someone kicked me in the stomach — I’m over the edge,”</em> the dead boy’s father, Derek Majewski, said to the Toronto Sun. <em>“Sometimes, it makes my blood boil.”</em> </p><p> The family’s attorney, Brian Cameron, expressed similar shock over receiving news of the lawsuit. </p><p> <em>"In my 14 years of doing this, I've unfortunately represented far too many people who have lost children being hit by motorists, (and) I've never seen this,"</em> Cameron told Toronto’s CTV News Channel. <em>"I've never even heard of this … I was shocked when I got the claim."</em> </p><p> According to the lawsuit, Simon pins the blame for the accident on the teenagers themselves, with the suit stating, <em>“They did not apply their brakes properly. They were incompetent bicyclists.”</em> </p><p> Simon’s lawyer, Michael Ellis, argued his client has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder due to the incident and suffers from headaches, anxiety, depression, and emotional discomfort. Simon is suing seeking $1.3 million in damages for her <em>“great pain and suffering.”</em> </p><p> <em>"She relives the terror of this incident every day. Ms. Simon has been unable to return to work since the collision. She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She is also a victim,"</em> Ellis said, according to CTV News. </p><p> As noted by the Sun, however, the police report describing the incident shows that Simon admitted to speeding when the accident occurred. She was driving 90 km/hr in an 80 km/hr zone, and said she did not see the teenagers or the orange-red reflectors on their bikes. </p><p> Simon was being followed in a separate car by her husband, a York Regional police officer, and did not undergo a breathalyzer test, since police did not believe she was driving under the influence. Simon’s husband drove her home after the accident and no charges were filed. </p><p> The family, however, claims Simon may have been drinking and possibly on the phone when she struck the teenagers, in addition to speeding. The family had previously filed a suit seeking $900,000 in damages related to <em>“emotional trauma and shock.”</em> </p><p> <em>“I’m devastated, I’m in shock,”</em> Brandon’s mother, Venetta Mylnczyk, said to the Sun. <em>“She killed my child and now she wants to profit from it? She says she’s in pain? Tell her to look inside my head and she will see pain, she will see panic, she will see nightmares.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/155312-rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us/</guid><title><![CDATA[US sanctions won't undermine Russian economy]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/155312-rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/00/00/rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us.jpg" title="Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin (RIA Novosti/Aleksey Nikolskyi)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 18:46:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/eb/00/00/rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The third round of US sanctions do not heavily target Russia's key industries, but include asset freezes against 17 companies and 7 individuals, including Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/eb/00/00/rosneft-sechin-sanctions-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin (RIA Novosti/Aleksey Nikolskyi)" /> <p> All companies on the <a href="http://rt.com/news/155316-obama-sanctions-putin-calculus/" target="_blank">fresh round of sanctions</a> are owned by Gennady Timchenko, <a href="http://rt.com/business/154228-rotenberg-pipe-sales-gazprom/" target="_blank">Arkady and Boris Rotenberg</a>, or <a href="http://rt.com/business/rossiya-bank-sanctions-ruble-913/" target="_blank">Bank Rossiya</a>, which were targets of the second round, the US Treasury Department said in a <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2369.aspx" target="_blank">statement</a> on their website on Monday, April 28. </p><p> <em>"Companies have been designated on the Entity List based on a determination they are involved, or pose a significant risk of becoming involved, in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,"</em> the US Office of Congressional and Public Affairs said in a press release. </p><p> The banks sanctioned are SMP Bank, Russia's 36th largest by assets, Sobinbank, the country's 90th largest bank, and Investkapitalbank, number 197. </p><p> Arkady Rotenberg's bank, SMP, was <em>"ready"</em> for the sanctions, according to a bank spokesperson, who said the lending institution had already taken a number of precautions to minimize any sanction-related damage to customers. </p><p> Following the announcement of sanctions, US-based payment system MasterCard suspended its services to two Russian banks, targeted SMP and Investcapitalbank. This brings the number of Russian banks that the system has stopped working with to four. In March, MasterCard <a href="http://rt.com/business/visa-mastercard-russia-sanctions-285/" target="_blank">suspended</a><a href="http://rt.com/business/visa-mastercard-russia-sanctions-285/" target="_blank"></a> work with Sobinbank and Bank Rossiya, but then <a href="http://rt.com/business/visa-mastercard-us-sanctions-693/" target="_blank">resumed</a> services shortly. International payment systems Visa and MasterCard already halted services with both SMP and Investcapitalbank in March. </p><p> No publicly-listed Russian companies were included on the new sanction list, but Obama said that the US and its allies would keep broader sanctions <em>“in reserve”</em> in the event of further escalation on the ground in Ukraine. Before, US politicians <a href="http://rt.com/business/gazprom-bank-us-sanctions-768/" target="_blank">called</a> for sanctions against Russia's finance and energy sectors. </p><p> <iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/220707581/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-ivyrrsus57hz0qc8m26&amp;show_recommendations=true" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.706896551724138" id="doc_25985" name="doc_25985" frameborder="0" height="800" scrolling="no" width="600"><br></iframe> </p><h2> Sechin, Sanctioned </h2><p> Igor Sechin, the head of Russia’s biggest oil company Rosneft, is a prominent Russian businessman singled out by the US. Former Board of Director, Sergey Chemezov, was also placed under sanctioned. Chemezov is the current CEO of state-owned hi-tech holding company Rostec. </p><p> Sanctions, however, do not affect Russia’s state-owned Rosneft. </p><p> Commenting on the newly imposed sanctions, Sechin linked the measure to Rosneft’s activity and considered it as <em>“an appreciation”</em> of the company’s <em>“efficiency”.</em> </p><p> <em>“We understand that the American administration noticed the company’s active actions aimed at minimizing the risks, linked with the unilateral orientation of hydrocarbons exports to concrete regional markets,"</em> Rosneft's press office cited Sechin as saying in a statement. <em>"I take the last steps by Washington as an appreciation of the efficiency of our work."</em> </p><p> He assured Rosneft’s shareholders that the US measures against him would not affect the company’s effectiveness and stressed that the oil producer will continue cooperation with American partners. </p><p> Despite the sanctions, US oil giant ExxonMobil and Rosneft will continue to develop hydrocarbon reserves in the arctic waters of Russia. On Monday, Rosneft approved the development of two oil fields jointly with ExxonMobil at a board meeting, the company said in a statement. </p><p> Rosneft shares in Moscow fell 1.56 percent at 18:30 local Moscow time. The total market capitalization of the company is $64.7 billion. BP shares were down 1.3 percent. </p><p> By personally going after Sechin, the US has sent a message that the next round of sanctions could hit the heart of the Russian economy- the energy sector. </p><h2> BP and 'Big Oil' </h2><p> When Sechin was rumored to be on a previous EU sanction list, a spokesperson <a href="http://rt.com/business/eu-sanctions-sechin-rosneft-906/">said</a> the move was <em>"stupid"</em> and would <em>"sabotage"</em> the West, which has very tight-knit relations with 'Big Oil' companies based in the UK and US. </p><p> Rosneft is the world’s largest-listed oil company, and British Petroleum (BP) has a 19.75 percent stake, making it the biggest foreign investor in Russia's oil sector. </p><p> BP, Europe's second-largest oil company is based in the UK, but over 40 percent of assets are located in the US.BP CEO Bob Dudley has told shareholders the company remains positive about <a href="http://rt.com/business/business-usual-bp-russia-896/">business with Russia</a>. </p><p> <em>"We are considering today's announcement to see specifically what this may mean for BP,"</em> a spokesman for BP in London said, adding the company would comply with any <em>"relevant"</em> sanctions. </p><p> <em>"We are committed to our investment in Rosneft, and we intend to remain a successful, long term investor in Russia,"</em> the spokesman said. </p><p> Other individuals on the list are politicians, including Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak and Aleksey Pushkov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs. </p><p> Individuals on the new list will have their assets frozen and be denied visas to travel to the US. </p><h2> America's 'Cold War Mentality' </h2><p> Previously, the <a href="http://rt.com/news/eu-sanctions-russia-ukraine-197/">EU</a> and <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ukraine-us-russia-sanctions-129/">US</a> blacklisted dozens of Russian politicians and businessmen, freezing assets and issuing travel bans. The US also imposed sanctions on Russia’s 14th largest lender, Bank Rossiya. </p><p> The US Treasury Department's statement said the new sanctions were motivated by Russia's failure to deescalate violence in neighboring Ukraine. </p><p> Moscow maintains that further economic sanctions against Russia simply fuel the revival of a Cold War mentality and are counter-productive. Russian President Vladimir Putin has <a href="http://rt.com/business/russia-west-oil-prices-136/">said</a> that Western efforts to disrupt Russia's influence over the world energy market will backfire and hurt the US. </p><p> The EU has so far not introduced a third stage of sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, as there is little consensus among member states. </p><p> On April 17, leaders from Russia, Ukraine, EU, and the US <a href="http://rt.com/news/geneva-document-ukraine-deescalation-224/" target="_blank">agreed</a> a peace plan for Ukraine in Geneva, Switzerland. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155448-microsoft-internet-explorer-0day/</guid><title><![CDATA[Internet Explorer users risk having their computers taken over]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155448-microsoft-internet-explorer-0day/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/80/00/major-security-flaw-hits-internet-explorer.jpg" title="Internet Explorer logo"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 18:45:16 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f3/80/00/major-security-flaw-hits-internet-explorer.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​A major security flaw affecting several versions of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer web browser was discovered over the weekend, and the percentage of computer users that could be compromised by the exploit is absolutely staggering.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f3/80/00/major-security-flaw-hits-internet-explorer.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Internet Explorer logo" /> <p> Bill Gates’ Microsoft Corp. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/security/2963983" target="_blank">announced</a> on Saturday that Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11 are all vulnerable to a glitch that when properly exploited can give hackers remote access to a victim’s computer. </p><p> When combined, versions nine through 11 of the browser accounted for 26.25 percent of all web traffic in 2013, security firm <a href="http://www.fireeye.com/blog/?p=5312" target="_blank">FireEye</a> claimed over the weekend. If all vulnerable versions are accounted for, however, then upwards of <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpcustomd=0&amp;qpsp=168&amp;qpnp=12&amp;qptimeframe=M" target="_blank">56 percent</a> of the browsers currently in use around the world are reportedly in danger of being exploited. </p><p> A person with knowledge of the vulnerability may create a fake website that, when visited, allows the hacker to exploit the bug and break into their target’s machine, Microsoft warned. </p><p> <em>"An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights,"</em> the company advised. </p><p> According to FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza, hackers had already taken advantage of the exploit by targeting unnamed US-based firms that are tied to the defense and financial sectors. </p><p> <em>"It's unclear what the motives of this attack group are, at this point,</em>” De Souza told Reuters on Sunday. <em>"It appears to be broad-spectrum intel gathering."</em> </p><p> On the official FireEye blog, security experts said that the hacking campaign has been dubbed “Operation Clandestine Fox,” and is consistent with other attacks linked to an advanced persistent threat group that has previously attracted the attention of investigators. </p><p> The unknown APT group has had access to "<em>a select number of browser-based 0-day exploits in the past</em>,” FireEye stated, but declined to publish further details. </p><p> Microsoft was unable to patch the vulnerability by the time the weekend was over, and the United States government’s Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) issued an <a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2014/04/28/Microsoft-Internet-Explorer-Use-After-Free-Vulnerability-Being" target="_blank">alert</a> warning computer users to “<em>consider employing an alternative web browser</em>.” </p><p> <em>"We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem,</em>" Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute warned in an advisory of its own. </p><p> Additionally, news of the vulnerability surfaced only weeks after Microsoft officially retired from offering security patches to its highly popular XP operating system. </p><p> <em>"XP users are not safe anymore and this is the first vulnerability that will be not patched for their system,"</em> Symantec researcher Christian Tripputi warned. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155380-ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings/</guid><title><![CDATA[Anti-Kiev protesters barricade City Hall in eastern Ukraine (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155380-ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/ef/40/00/ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings.jpg" title="Pro-federalization supporters and city residents make barricades using concrete blocks near the city council  building in Konstantinovka in Donetsk Region (RIA Novosti / Mikhail Voskresensky)"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 17:48:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/ef/40/00/ukraine-protesters-barricade-buildings.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Anti-government protesters have seized administrative buildings, including the City Hall and prosecutor’s office in yet another city in Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine.

The photo has already been favorited by more than 14,100 people and retweeted by nearly 30,000. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> My selfie with President Obama ! <a href="http://t.co/mr94wZtmuA">pic.twitter.com/mr94wZtmuA</a> </p>— Mohd Najib Tun Razak (@NajibRazak) <a href="https://twitter.com/NajibRazak/statuses/460289899791253504">April 27, 2014</a> </blockquote><p> As noted by Time Magazine, the selfie’s emergence is a little awkward, since it came just days after Obama denied a similar request by a 13-year-old girl after speaking to US troops in South Korea. The young girl was holding a sign that read, “Mr. President may I have a selfie with you?” but Obama reportedly told the young lady that if he took a photo with her he’d have to do so with everyone else. </p><p> Regardless, some of the president’s critics just want the whole selfie-taking craze to stop completely. After the Obama/Razak photo exploded onto the internet, Fox News host Greta Van Susteran responded on Twitter asking, <em>“how much longer are ‘selfies’ going to be the fad?”</em> </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> how much longer are 'selfies' going to be the fad? </p>— Greta Van Susteren (@gretawire) <a href="https://twitter.com/gretawire/statuses/460415635588407296">April 27, 2014</a> </blockquote><p> Of course, this isn’t the first time President Obama has indulged people – or world leaders, for that matter – when it comes to the fine art of selfie-taking. At last year’s memorial service for the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, Obama was caught taking a selfie with British Prime Minster David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. As RT <a href="http://rt.com/news/obama-selfie-mandela-service-017/" target="_blank">reported</a> then, some criticized the leaders for their decision to take the photo during a funeral service. </p><p> </p><p> Meanwhile, Obama’s participation in selfies was further called into question in early April, when baseball player David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox tweeted a photo taken with the president at a White House visit. It was later revealed that the entire stunt was organized by Ortiz and smartphone maker Samsung, leading some in the administration to wonder if Obama would take any more selfies moving forward. </p><p> </p><p> <em>"As a rule the White House objects to attempts to use the president's likeness for commercial purposes, and we certainly object in this case,"</em> White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said at the time. </p><p> Just two weeks ago, though, Obama appeared in one more selfie, this time with Vice President Joe Biden, who also posted the photo online. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155428-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/</guid><title><![CDATA[US military expands presence in Philippines despite constitutional ban]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155428-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f2/40/00/us_military.jpg" title="U.S marines look for their tents as they arrive at Crow Valley for the Philippines-U.S. amphibious landing exercise dubbed Phiblex 2013 in Tarlac, north of Manila, October 9, 2012.

(Reuters)" /> <p> US President Barack Obama inked his name to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement on Monday in Manila as he wrapped up a weeklong tour of the region that included stops in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. </p><p> But amidst allegations that the US is entering the pact with Philippines just to keep a watchful eye on China’s military, Pres. Obama said the agreement is intended to help uphold international law, even perhaps with the help of the Chinese. </p><p> <em>"Our goal is not to counter China. Our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make sure international rules and norms are respected and that includes in the area of international disputes,"</em> Obama said at a news conference with Philippine President Benigno Aquino III at the Malacanang Palace in Manila, according to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/28/obama-visits-philippines_n_5224504.html" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>. </p><p> According to the AP, Pres. Aquino said the deal <em>"takes our security cooperation to a higher level of engagement, reaffirms our countries' commitment to mutual defense and security and promotes regional peace and stability."</em> </p><p> <em>“The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement serves as recognition that there is even more we can do together to support the alliance and promote peace and security in the region,”</em> added US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip S. Goldberg, according to the state-run <a href="http://news.pia.gov.ph/index.php?article=241398679339" target="_blank">Philippine Information Agency</a>. </p><p> Nevertheless, critics have suggested that the agreement is only authorizing the US to expand its influence in the region and turn the heat up on China in the midst of a <a href="http://rt.com/usa/biden-china-abe-airspace-658/" target="_blank">territory dispute</a> between Beijing officials and America’s Japanese allies concerning islands in the South China Sea. </p><p> On Monday, the Philippines’ <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/597859/what-is-the-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement-and-what-does-it-mean-for-ph" target="_blank">Inquirer</a> news outlet write that militant groups in the area are protesting the agreement because they believe it violates the local constitution on account of how it authorizes US troops to make use of island bases. Some opponents, the Inquirer added, also believe that negotiations were fast-tracked in order to be ready in time for Pres. Obama’s arrival this week. </p><p> Indeed, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement does contain rules for how the US can use military bases in the Philippines for the next ten years. At the same time, however, a provision in the contract explicitly acknowledged that the US <em>“[cannot] establish military presence or base in the Philippines”</em> by entering the agreement. Instead, local facilities will remain under control of the Philippine military, but US forces will be routinely rotated in to participate in joint training exercises. </p><p> <em>“The Philippine Constitution bars permanent US military bases, although hundreds of American military personnel have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002 to provide counterterrorism training to Filipino soldiers fighting Muslim militants,”</em> the AP acknowledged on Monday. </p><p> Other provisions of the agreement require the US to get prior consent from the Philippines before using agreed upon locations, which will remain the primary responsibility of the local government. If officials allow the US to construct and buildings or ownership during the ten-year tenure, then those facilities will also become property of the Philippines, the agreement also proclaims. </p><p> Plans to establish what bases the US will be allowed access to under the deal have yet to be revealed, but the AP speculated that a former US facility at Subic Bay could be re-opened. According to <a href="http://rt.com/news/155192-us-philippines-security-pact/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, a military source believes the US will gradually deploy combat ships, a squadron of F18s or F16s and maritime surveillance aircraft to the Philippines now that the deal has been authorized. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155392-dyncorp-afghan-reconstruction-contract/</guid><title><![CDATA[DynCorp-gate: How State Dept. wasted billions on Afghan reconstruction]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155392-dyncorp-afghan-reconstruction-contract/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f0/00/00/dyncorp.jpg" title="AFP Photo/Massoud Hossaini"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 16:25:56 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f0/00/00/dyncorp.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Department of State has spent billions on Afghan reconstruction since America’s longest-running war began there over a decade ago, but a new report reveals that the majority of that money went to a single contractor with a sordid past.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f0/00/00/dyncorp.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo/Massoud Hossaini" /> <p> According to that recently released <a href="http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/special%20projects/SIGAR-14-49-SP.pdf" target="_blank">write-up</a>, the United States gave $2.7 billion to Virginia-based military contractor DynCorp between 2002 and March 2013, even as the embattled firm was being berated by bad publicity brought on by a handful of scandals and mishaps. </p><p> In 2007, for example, a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR) report determined that “<em>DynCorp seemed to act almost independently of its reporting officers at the Department of State</em>,” and had billed the US government for millions of dollars for unauthorized work. In 2011, the company agreed to settle the dispute by signing a check to the State Dept. for $7.7 million, but that same year the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks published a <a href="http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/06/09KABUL1651.html" target="_blank">diplomatic cable</a> that further attracted negative attention to DynCorp by revealing that contractors hired an underage Afghan boy to entertain them. Nevertheless, DynCorp continued to take in billions from the State Dept. for contract work in both Afghanistan and <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-iraq-billion-spending-500/" target="_blank">Iraq</a>. </p><p> The latest SIGAR report — published on Thursday last week — reveals that, despite this reputation, DynCorp managed to rake in more money from the State Dept. than any other contractor. As the US prepares to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan, however, DynCorp’s efficiency is being called into question. </p><p> Of the roughly $4 billion spent by the State Dept. between 2002 and March 2013, the US awarded 1,874 contracts, grants and cooperative agreements to 771 organizations and individuals, according to the report. Of that chunk, about $3.5 billion — or 87 percent — went to supporting large, so-called "rule-of-law" projects — and almost all of that ended up being awarded to DynCorp. </p><p> The $2.7 billion in government contracts — $2,751,391,412.62, to be exact — that was awarded to DynCorp during that 11-year duration was for the primary purpose of “police development,” according to last week’s report. And as the SIGAR’s summary indicates, the sheer amount of money awarded to DynCorp far exceeds every other State Dept. contract. </p><p> <em>“The top recipient of State reconstruction funding by total awards was Dyncorp International Limited Liability Corporation (Dyncorp),”</em> the SIGAR report reads<em>. “Dyncorp received approximately $2.8 billion in contracts, accounting for 69 percent of total State Department reconstruction awards.”</em> The firm that received the second-most money from the State Dept. through contractors was PAE Government Services Incorporated at $597.8 million — or about one-fourth of what DynCorp received. The next company on the list was awarded only one-tenth of that. </p><p> But were the billions dished out for law enforcement operations in Afghanistan even worth it? The latest SIGAR report notes that <em>“Dyncorp contracts dealt principally with training and equipping the Afghan National Police and counternarcotics forces,”</em> and <em>“included police trainers, construction of police infrastructure and fielding police equipment and vehicles.</em>” Last November it was reported that Afghan opium production has only <a href="http://rt.com/news/afghanistan-opium-un-warlords-657/" target="_blank">surged</a>, and just last week three American civilians were killed as the result of an attack in Kabul. According to the <a href="http://icasualties.org/oef/" target="_blank">iCasualties.org</a> website, 16 US troops have died so far this year in Afghanistan. </p><p> Neil Gordon, an investigator with the DC-based Project on Government Oversight transparency group, asked in an <a href="http://www.pogo.org/blog/2014/04/20140424-meet-the-3-largest-recipients-of-state-dept-afghan-aid.html" target="_blank">article</a> published last week if it made sense to but a firm with such a “colorful past” at the helm of reconstruction efforts. DynCorp, Gordon wrote, has previously been linked to “instances of <em>labor smuggling</em>,<em>weak performance and over payments</em> on a base support services contract,<em>botched construction work</em> on an Afghan Army garrison and <em>lawsuits filed by disgruntled subcontractors</em>.” Nevertheless, they’ve remained the State Department’s go-to guys when it comes to Afghan contracts. </p><p> State Dept. whistleblower Peter Van Buren <a href="http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2014/04/28/state-department-gives-87-of-afghan-funds-to-only-five-recipients/" target="_blank">wrote</a> for Firedoglake this week that he thinks these massive contractors several implications, in his opinion. </p><p> <em>“The smallest issue seems to be the massive hemorrhaging of money into just one corporate pocket. Given the amounts, one looks forward to future SIGAR reporting about how this came to be. How many non-competed contracts? How many insider deals? How much unaccounted for money? The appearance of corruption, as well as the opportunities for corruption, are evident,”</em> Van Buren wrote. </p><p> <em>“The next issue of course is what, if anything, was accomplished with all that taxpayer money absent enriching a few large corporations. Pick your trend line, and it is hard to find much bang for the buck(s) in Afghanistan,”</em> he added. </p><p> Van Buren isn’t the only one that has raised objections recently about US money in Afghanistan, either: earlier this month, a letter from SIGAR's general counsel accused the US Agency for International Developmentof having “<em>covered up information</em>” that showed that the Afghan government has been largely unable to account for cash or resources provided through US support endeavors. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155424-donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters/</guid><title><![CDATA[Blasts, fierce fighting in Donetsk between pro- and anti-Kiev demos (VIDEO, PHOTOS)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155424-donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f2/00/00/donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters.jpg" title="Photo from Twitter/@GrahamWP_UK"/><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 16:14:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/25/f2/00/00/donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />There's gunfire, explosions and brutal clashes in the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine as fighting erupted between pro- and anti-govt protesters, RT’s stringer reports from the scene.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/25/f2/00/00/donetsk-clashes-ukraine-protesters.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo from Twitter/@GrahamWP_UK" /> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Video in a minute, pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine demos have met, and it's ugly. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Donetsk&amp;src=hash">#Donetsk</a><a href="http://t.co/ODfvGmhHHk">pic.twitter.com/ODfvGmhHHk</a> </p> <p> — GrahamWPhillips (@GrahamWP_UK) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamWP_UK/statuses/460810128896163842">April 28, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> 14 people have asked for medical assistance, with several hospitalized, after clashes in Donetsk, the regional administration told Interfax-Ukraine news agency. <br><br> According to Novosti Donbassa (Donbas News), eight people have been taken to the city’s Kalinin hospital after violence broke out. <br><br> The website also reports of a policeman being shell-shocked due to handmade grenade exploding near him. </p><p> Pro- and-anti-Kiev protest rallies took place simultaneously in the city. </p><p> According to RT’s stringer Graham Phillips, there were plenty of masked young men on both sides, and they were clearly looking for a fight. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-L4k62QabIM" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> The police failed to contain the crowd as protesters clashed with each other, using firecrackers, smoke grenades, baseball bats and sticks. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Po9op0k4WYs" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </p><p> A group of about 1,000 “neo-Nazi thugs” has come to Donetsk from Dnepropetrovsk on Monday to cause provocations, the press-service of the self-proclaimed People’s Republic of Donetsk told RT. <br><br><em>“We were expecting an attack.

Non-fatal shootings also occurred, including a drive-by that injured four men who were standing on a sidewalk. </p><p> The first of the weekend’s fatalities occurred Friday evening, when 32-year-old Leonore Draper was found shot inside of a parked vehicle in the West Pullman neighborhood, about an hour after she reportedly left an anti-violence event. Local residents told police they heard gunshots around 10:30 p.m. </p><p> When police found Draper – a Chicago Public Schools budget analyst – she had suffered gunshot wounds to her chest and arm. She was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead just after 12:30 a.m. Police told the Sun-Times they are looking into the possibility that the incident was a drive-by. </p><p> Around 1:15 a.m. on Saturday, 21-year-old Martarvian Emery was at home with a 19-year-old woman when an unknown individual standing outside opened fire. The assailant fatally shot Emery in the chest, who was declared dead at the scene, and also wounded the woman in the leg. She was taken to a hospital and is in stable condition, according to the Chicago Tribune. </p><p> A little more than an hour later, Jaquez Williams, 17, was declared dead in the Austin neighborhood on Chicago’s West Side. Williams was standing outside when an unknown individual approached him and shot him in the head. </p><p> The most recent death occurred on early Sunday morning, when Cindy Bahena, 21, was shot and killed in the back seat in the back seat of a car being driven by a known gang member. According to the Sun-Times, police News Affair Officer Hector Alfaro said multiple men were standing near the car when one of them began shouting gang slogans and fired shots at the vehicle. </p><p> Bahena is not believed to be the intended target of the shooting. She was taken to a hospital but declared dead at 12:47 a.m. </p><p> Even before the past weekend’s fatalities were being tallied, the Tribune reported deadly encounter between an off-duty police officer and his 86-year-old neighbor on Friday afternoon. According to police, an argument between the two parties escalated when the neighbor shot and wounded the officer’s wife. This caused the officer to fatally shoot the man, and subsequently shoot and injure the neighbor’s wife when she reportedly attempted to reach for her husband’s shotgun. </p><p> No arrests have been made in connection to any of these crimes, though authorities say they are investigating. </p><p> These events are just the latest in a string of deadly weekends in Chicago. As RT <a href="http://rt.com/usa/dead-injured-chicago-violence-820/" target="_blank">reported previously</a>, Easter weekend saw shootings take the lives of 9 people and injure 32 others. At the time, the city had seen 288 people victimized by shootings since the start of 2014. In 2013, approximately 2,100 people were involved in shootings. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
