we’ve seen that in 2008.”</em> </p><p> Earlier this week, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the builduip of NATO troops near Russia’s border was “<a href="http://rt.com/news/155476-shoigu-hagel-ukraine-rhetoric/" target="_blank">unprecedented</a>.” Weeks earlier, the US Air Force commander in charge of NATO’s military presence in Europe said that US troops may soon be <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-troops-nato-ukraine-484/" target="_blank">deployed</a> to the region as tensions continue to worsen near the border between Ukraine and Russia. </p><p> For weeks now, officials in Washington and Kiev have claimed that the recent separation of Crimea from Ukraine and the rash of uprisings in the country’s eastern part are the direct result of destabilization efforts spearheaded by Moscow, and both the US and European Union have introduced several rounds of sanctions against Russia as a result. The Kremlin has refuted these claims and rebuffed the sanctions, however, and earlier this week Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin <a href="http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/" target="_blank">accused</a> the White House of orchestrating the Ukrainian crisis. </p><p> <em>“I think what is happening now shows us who really was mastering the process from the beginning. But in the beginning, the United States preferred to remain in the shadow,”</em> Putin said this week<em>.</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156200-los-angeles-fires-evacuation/</guid><title><![CDATA[Wildfire triggers mass evacuation near Los Angeles (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156200-los-angeles-fires-evacuation/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/22/80/00/los-angeles-fires-evacuation.jpg" title="Smoke rises from a charred landscape as a wildfire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds spreads in Rancho Cucamonga, California, April 30, 2014 (Reuters / David McNew)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 16:47:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/22/80/00/los-angeles-fires-evacuation.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A rapidly spreading wildfire in Southern California forced the evacuation of more than 1,600 homes Wednesday, as powerful winds drove it closer and closer to a city just east of Los Angeles.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/22/80/00/los-angeles-fires-evacuation.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Smoke rises from a charred landscape as a wildfire driven by fierce Santa Ana winds spreads in Rancho Cucamonga, California, April 30, 2014 (Reuters / David McNew)" /> <p> The fire initially began around 8 a.m. Wednesday morning in the Etiwanda Preserve of the San Bernardino National Forest. Although it started off covering only about 20 acres of forest, strong and unpredictable gusts of wind from the neighboring mountains quickly spread the fire through 200 acres in a span of two hours. </p><p> By the middle of the day, the fire had scorched through more than 1,000 acres of land, buoyed by winds up to 80 miles per hour. According to the Los Angeles Times, the fire had only been 10 percent contained by Thursday morning. </p><p> </p><p> With smoke promptly making its way to the edges of Rancho Cucamonga – a city with a population of 165,000 people – the US Forest Service employed a mandatory evacuation, forcing residents from 1,650 homes due to the instability of the fire. Local schools were also evacuated. </p><p> <em>“Any time they tell me it’s time to go, I can get out of here. I don’t want to be in anyone’s way,”</em> said local resident Barbora Konecna to the LA Times in a separate report. <em>“With the wind going the way it is, you just don’t know.”</em> </p><p> According to KTTV Los Angeles, the mandatory evacuation had been lifted by 6 p.m. Wednesday, though a voluntary evacuation remains in place. Damage has been reported to one home in Rancho Cucamonga, with residents on alert in case changing wind patterns necessitate further action. </p><p> </p><p> Speaking with CNN affiliate KCBS on Wednesday, Bob Poole of the US Forestry Service said the conditions were too risky to use aircraft to battle the flames. </p><p> <em>"The big challenge on these fires is the wind and the unpredictability, and with winds like this we can't put up aircraft. It's just too dangerous,”</em> he said. <em>“So we try and figure out where it's going to end up and put our resources there.”</em> </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KIZ4yPCSf7Y" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> With hundreds of firefighters and dozens of trucks involved and hoping to make gains against the fire, the National Weather Service’s Miguel Miller said there was mixed news coming in for Thursday’s efforts. </p><p> <em>“The bad news is, we're going to have some tough, hot, dry, windy conditions to fight that fire, and in case any other fire gets started, it's going to spread quickly,”</em> he said. <em>“The good news is, conditions will improve this afternoon.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156176-military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket/</guid><title><![CDATA[Military sexual assault reports skyrocket 50 percent]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156176-military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/21/00/00/military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket.jpg" title="Reuters / Finbarr O'Reilly"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 15:46:27 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/21/00/00/military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Members of the United States military are increasingly coming forward regarding sexual assault – so much so that the number of cases reported have shot up by 50 percent.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/21/00/00/military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Finbarr O'Reilly" /> <p> Following a recent push by the Pentagon to encourage victims to step forward and report abuses, a new survey – scheduled for release Thursday – is expected to show there were more than 5,000 cases of sexual assault during the 2013 fiscal year ending September 30. During the previous fiscal year, more than 3,300 cases were reported. </p><p> What’s more, the Associated Press is reporting that the Pentagon was able to discipline in some way about 73 percent of those accused of assault, a seven percent increase over 2012. </p><p> Notably, though, the military is still frustrated with the number of men who are not reporting cases of assault – ranging from unsolicited sexual contact to rape and sodomy. About 6.2 percent of women reported being sexually assaulted last year, but only 1.2 percent of men did. Despite the gap in percentage, there were still more cases of men being assaulted (nearly 14,000) than women (a little more than 12,000). </p><p> Considering the number of men in the military dwarfs the number of women, officials are looking at new ways to encourage men to report abuse when they see or experience it. </p><p> <em>"There is still a misperception that this is a women's issue and women's crime,"</em> Nate Galbreath, an adviser for the Pentagon's sexual assault prevention office, said to the AP. <em>"It's disheartening that we have such a differential between the genders and how they are choosing to report."</em> </p><p> Despite the documentation of a surge in reported abuse, some have criticized the Pentagon’s upcoming report for its methodology. According to the New York Times, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) wrote a letter to the Defense Department last week raising concern over the possibility that the survey adjusted the military’s definition of unwanted sexual contact, writing it <em>“will make it impossible to determine whether the data accurately reflects the impact of the policies and procedures instituted by the Armed Forces.”</em> </p><p> For its part, the Pentagon said it is making progress. </p><p> <em>“For us, the 50 percent increase in reporting is significant,”</em> Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John F. Kirby said to the Times. <em>“Obviously you want to get to zero incidents, but the fact that more victims are coming forward tells us that their confidence in the system is growing. And that’s a good thing.”</em> </p><p> In the past, many victims of sexual assault declined to come forward, especially against those higher in rank, out of fear. Others who did report a case said they were often ignored. As noted by the AP, an anonymous 2012 survey showed roughly 26,000 service members claimed being assaulted. Lawmakers such as Gillibrand, meanwhile, claim only one out of every 10 cases are actually reported. </p><p> A recent case involving a US Army general accused of sexually assaulting a female captain ended in March with the general being fined and spared any jail time – a sentence that surprised many who expected a harsher sentence. As RT reported then, the general was initially charged with forcible sodomy among other things, and pleaded guilty to adultery and mistreating his accuser. </p><p> According to Major Gen. Jeffrey Snow of the Pentagon’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, Thursday’s report did not suggest that the number of crimes in the military has increased, and it is believed the spike is due to increased confidence in the Pentagon’s willingness to go after abusers. </p><p> <em>"There is no indication that this increase in reporting constitutes an increase in crime,"</em> he said. <em>"We assess that this unprecedented increase is consistent with a growing confidence in the response systems."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156172-scotus-ndaa-hedges-obama/</guid><title><![CDATA[Supreme Court refuses to stop indefinite detention of Americans under NDAA]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156172-scotus-ndaa-hedges-obama/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/20/c0/00/scotus-declines-to-hear-ndaa.jpg" title="The exterior of the U.S. Supreme Court is seen in Washington (Reuters / Gary Cameron)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 15:46:22 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/20/c0/00/scotus-declines-to-hear-ndaa.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The United States Supreme Court this week effectively ended all efforts to overturn a controversial 2012 law that grants the government the power to indefinitely detain American citizens without due process.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/20/c0/00/scotus-declines-to-hear-ndaa.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="The exterior of the U.S. Supreme Court is seen in Washington (Reuters / Gary Cameron)" /> <p> On Monday, the high court said it won’t weigh in on challenge filed by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges and a bevy of co-plaintiffs against US President Barack Obama, ending for now a two-and-a-half-year debate concerning part of an annual Pentagon spending bill that since 2012 has granted the White House the ability to indefinitely detain people <em>"who are part of or substantially support Al-Qaeda, the Taliban or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States.”</em> <br><br> The Obama administration has long maintained that the provision — Section 1021(b)(2) of the <a href="http://rt.com/trends/national-defense-authorization-act-indefinite-detention/" target="_blank">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> — merely reaffirmed verbiage contained within the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, signed by then-President George W. Bush in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. <br><br> Opponents, however, argued that the language in Section 1021 of the NDAA is overly vague and could be interpreted in a way that allows for the government to detain without trial any American citizen accused of committing a “<em>belligerent act</em>” against the country “<em>until the end of hostilities</em>.” <br><br> When the provision was first <a href="http://rt.com/usa/obama-hedges-ndaa-sued-933/" target="_blank">challenged</a> days after Pres. Obama signed it into law on December 31, 2011, Hedges — who previously worked as a war correspondent for the New York Times and covered matters concerning Al-Qaeda for the paper — said, <em>“I have had dinner more times than I can count with people whom this country brands as terrorists … but that does not make me one.”</em> <br><br> US District Judge Katherine Forrest <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-court-law-unconstitutional-031/" target="_blank">agreed</a> with Hedges and his co-plaintiffs, and months later wrote in a 112-page opinion that <em>“First Amendment rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and cannot be legislated away.”</em> <br><br><em>"This Court rejects the government's suggestion that American citizens can be placed in military detention indefinitely, for acts they could not predict might subject them to detention,”</em> Judge Forrest wrote. <br><br> But the District Court’s temporary, then permanent <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-court-law-unconstitutional-031/" target="_blank">injunction</a> against Sec. 1021 was challenged by the White House, and the Obama administration pleaded with the Justice Department to issue a <a href="http://rt.com/usa/appeals-ndaa-detention-public-536/" target="_blank">stay</a>. A federal appeals court ruled in <a href="http://rt.com/usa/obama-ndaa-appeal-suit-229/" target="_blank">favor</a> of the president last July and said that the government can, in fact, indefinitely detail a person who has provided support to anyone deemed a threat to America. <br><br> On his part, Hedges said he feared that the administration’s adamant attempts to keep the law in tact could mean that <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ndaa-reddit-plaintiffs-hedges-143/" target="_blank">the government has already relied on the NDAA</a> to imprison American citizens without trial. Attorneys for the plaintiffs responded by saying they would <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ndaa-scotus-hedges-suit-359/" target="_blank">take the case to the Supreme Court</a>, but his week the nine-justice panel said they won’t be hearing the case. <br><br> SCOTUS declined to make any comment regarding the case on Monday, but rather simply said that it would not be considered by the high court. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OZnKKMFL6no?feature=player_detailpage" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> <br> Last year, Hedges <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ndaa-scotus-hedges-suit-359/" target="_blank">warned</a> that the odds the court would take the case were slim, and said rejection on that level could lead to grave consequences with regards to freedoms in America. <br><br><em>“If we fail, if this law stands, if in the years ahead the military starts to randomly seize and disappear people, if dissidents and activists become subject to indefinite and secret detention in military gulags, we will at least be able to look back on this moment and know we fought back,”</em> he wrote. <br><br> On Monday this week, activist and co-plaintiff Tangerine Bolen <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s1igp1" target="_blank">wrote</a> that the high court’s decision to ignore the case means that <em>“the fundamental right of due process and our fundamental rights of free speech and association . . . no longer matter.”</em> <br><br><em>“We have tried to stand up to this madness: we are outnumbered, outspent and outgunned - a David intrepidly fighting a Goliath that spans the planet and has the power to shape our 'reality' - thus shaping what the courts even see. We have sacrificed greatly to do this - and yet we would do it all again,”</em> she wrote. <br><br> Hedges in Bolen were joined in their suit against the Obama administration by Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, writer Noam Chomsky, activist and journalist Alexa O’Brien, Icelandic parliamentarian and WikiLeaks associate Birgitta Jónsdóttir, Occupy London activist Kai Wargalla and acclaimed academic Dr. Cornel West. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156184-fracking-water-safety-concerns/</guid><title><![CDATA[Canada kick up a fracking fuss as govt body slams poor research]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156184-fracking-water-safety-concerns/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/21/80/00/fracking-water-safety-concerns.jpg" title="Reuters / Mario Anzuoni"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 15:45:44 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/21/80/00/fracking-water-safety-concerns.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A new report by Environment Canada, a governmental body, admits there is too little scientific information on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on the environment and human health.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/21/80/00/fracking-water-safety-concerns.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Mario Anzuoni" /> <p> The report by 14 international experts was compiled at the request of Environment Canada to consider the pollution impacts of the exploration and extraction of Canada’s shale gas resources. </p><p> Unlike the United States, which has seen an explosion of shale gas development, fracking in Canada has moved at a much slower pace.The authors note that this gives the country an opportunity to develop shale gas resources responsibly. </p><p> The shale gas boom in Pennsylvania in the US has been administered at break neck speed and this means that any hazards associated with it are not properly understood. </p><p> <em>“We’re racing ahead without seriously thinking through how best to do this,”</em> said Dr. Goldstein, one of the authors of the report and professor of Environmental and Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh. </p><p> The report warns that: <em>“data about potential environmental impacts are neither sufficient nor conclusive.”</em> </p><p> While Rick Chalaturnyk, one of the report’s authors, said in an interview with CBS news that <em>“additional information needs to be collected to better understand and manage those impacts.”</em> </p><p> The study found that there were potentially serious impacts on surface water, groundwater, greenhouse gas emissions, cumulative land disturbance and human health. </p><p> <em>“Most experts agree that impacts on water raise the greatest environmental concern by shale gas development,”</em> says the report’s executive summary as quoted by iPolitics. </p><p> The process of hydraulic fracturing involves pumping chemicals and sand into rock deep underground, which then releases natural gas, held inside the bedrock. Both the gas and the chemicals used to extract it can leak into drinking water, and this is not being properly monitored, the report says. </p><p> <em>“For large-scale shale gas development now, I don’t think you want to be in a position anymore of just saying ‘trust me, we know what we’re doing.’ We’re past that,”</em> said Chalaturnyk. </p><p> The study says Canadians are suspicious they are not being told the full story about the dangers of fracking and that more research is needed to reassure people. </p><p> But even the scientists are in disagreement as there are many questions about the impacts of fracking that are hard to answer. </p><p> <em>“Unfortunately the science is at such an immature stage you’ve got widely different views,</em>” said John Cherry of Guelph University. </p><p> The authors also note that because of the different environments, ecosystems, geographies and geologies in Canada, regional impacts need to be considered when determining if an area is suitable for shale gas extraction. </p><p> In western Canada, where shale gas extraction has been developed under existing regulations for conventional oil and gas drilling, further changes may be needed. For example, the cement casings that surround wells to keep natural gas isolated from the environment are subject to much higher pressures and more wear and tear in hydraulic fracturing than in conventional drilling. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156164-marijuana-concert-colorado-orchestra/</guid><title><![CDATA[High note: Colorado Symphony Orchestra to host weed-friendly concerts]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156164-marijuana-concert-colorado-orchestra/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/20/40/00/marijuana-concert-colorado-orchestra.jpg" title="A woman blows smoke rings with marijuana smoke during the 4/20 Rally at the Civic Center in Denver, Colorado, April 20, 2014 (Reuters / Mark Leffingwell)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 14:32:09 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/20/40/00/marijuana-concert-colorado-orchestra.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Colorado Symphony Orchestra will host a series of bring-your-own-marijuana concerts across the state.

With regard to dress code and music, the concerts will not deviate from their classical roots, the only difference is audience members will be encouraged to bring along a stash of pot. </p><p> The group of concerts, aptly named “Classically Cannabis: The High Note Series,” has been billed as a fundraiser for the Symphony Orchestra. </p><p> "<em>We see ourselves as connecting classical music with all of Colorado</em>," said CSO Director Jerry Kern to the Denver Post. "<em>Part of our goal is to bring in a younger audience and a more diverse audience, and I would suggest that the patrons of the cannabis industry are both younger and more diverse than the patrons of the symphony orchestra</em>." </p><p> Companies looking to cash in on Colorado’s nascent pot industry will sponsor the concerts. Principal sponsor of the event, Ideal 420 Soils, produces nutrients to grow the “<em>highest quality marijuana in the marketplace</em>,” while secondary sponsors Gaia and The Farm both produce medical and recreational marijuana. </p><p> </p><p> Due to the nature of the event, the organizers have set an age limit of 21 and encourage their audience not to drive. </p><p> Colorado and Washington became the first states in the US to legalize the consumption and sale of marijuana in 2012. In January, Colorado began to sell the drug over the counter, yielding over $2 million in profits in the first month. </p><p> Lawmakers in Colorado are now discussing possible regulations related to edible marijuana after two deaths in the state were linked to the consumption of the drug.

The military and the police are everywhere, in different uniforms, marching or in armored vehicles. The streets are cordoned off with a barbed wire.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/1f/40/00/iraq-new-parliament-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo by Nadezhda Kevorkova" /> <p> Very few people are out and about. Parks and embankments have been deserted since Saturday. Shops, restaurants and all other public places are closed – starting from Friday, they are taking their days off. Kids are playing football on empty side streets. </p><p> Entering the country has been forbidden since Monday. All flights have been canceled and bus services have been suspended. Nobody can get in or out of Baghdad. This is the atmosphere in which the first Iraqi parliamentary elections are being since the withdrawal of US forces. Somehow people have forgotten that when the Americans were here, it was problematic to cross a street, let alone enter the country. </p><p> The mass media all over the world present Iraq as bankrupt and overwhelmed with terror. The reason for the terror is not the American invasion 11 years ago, but some inborn inability of different religious groups to exist in a civilized manner. Iraqi journalists are concerned about the fact that four US channels are reportedly planning to open offices in Baghdad after the elections. <em>“They invited me to work for them. They are looking for people. The US mass media don’t turn up for no reason. They always know if something is about to unfold somewhere,”</em> one journalist says. </p><p> Nobody approves of the measures taken by the government. While US forces were present in Iraq, people tried to avoid talking about the victims. When they left, there’s hardly anyone who wouldn’t criticize Iraq. </p><p> One senior police official, who preferred to stay anonymous, said: <em>“America can’t create good police in Iraq. Our police lack everything.”</em> </p><p> Even US weapons don’t appeal to him. </p><p> <em>“American weapons are bad, but what matters most is the problems they brought to Iraq,”</em> the police representative says. The weapons issue is a moot point, but the problems in Iraq are obvious. </p><p> <em>“Terrorists are very smart. There are experienced people among them. They receive money from abroad,”</em> the officer says. The police carry out no surveillance, have no agents, pretend to be working, they adopted tools and manners from the Americans that were, in his opinion, counter-productive in Iraq; it all astounds him. </p><p> The problem with security in Iraq is bargaining, which is regarded as corruption or lack of discipline by people in the West. </p><p> </p><p> Vigilance means that every soldier checks your ID. My ID was needed when I visited a polling station and they wanted to write my name down on a list of dignitaries. </p><p> If a car has some kind of permit and it’s on the front windshield, it will be stopped every 100 meters anyway. Sometimes soldiers ask for ID, sometimes drivers can salute the officers or joke and move on, but occasionally you need to stop and show your ID. The soldier then pull the barbed wire to one side and let you go. </p><p> Officers use special mirrors on sticks to inspect the bottom of the car and have equipment to detect explosives; usually they ask you to open the hood, but pay no attention to the trunk or those inside the car. <br><br> According to an official from the prime minister’s office, <em>“special services can’t protect themselves, so how can they protect people from bombs?"</em> </p><p> The closer to the polling station, the busier the street gets and the more police you see around. Their duties here are mainly to protect officials. Some of the police go to their APCs for a snack. </p><p> Most of the central voting districts of Baghdad saw the majority of the people vote for Maliki. When I ask a woman in a black hijab with children about her motive, she responds with a certain excitement: <em>“Why not?”</em> </p><p> Young girls declined to share their choice with me. A father of two children voted for a female candidate from al-Hakim, a religious Shia group, which has not sided with Maliki this time. Actually, there were many people who voted for al-Hakim. </p><p> Sheikh Аhmad Khafadgi cast his vote for the Saddikun group. <em>"You need to change everything. It’s not because I am against Maliki, but I am against the strategy of this government, or rather lack of any. If Maliki wins and reshapes his policies in our favor, we will support him,”</em> says the sheikh. He is convinced that cleric Muqtada Sadr’s group is going to grab a solid share of votes. But he does not actually agree with the cleric’s vision. </p><p> </p><p> A woman of 30 came to invalidate her ballot paper. Her parents migrated to Yemen under Saddam Hussein and returned just recently. Her dream is never to get married, travel around the world and see a democratic Iraq one day. </p><p> Mohammad Rayeed is a street photographer. A Shia, he used to serve in the army under Saddam. It’s the third time that he has voted for Maliki’s State of Law.<em>"We support Maliki because he’s a noble man and has a sense of proportion. Life is hard today: we used to have tourists, now there are none. True, Saddam was a dictator but we never had any terror attacks with him in power,"</em> he says. According to him, there’s a wide conspiracy against Iraq that has been arranged from abroad. </p><p> Hussein Ali, a farm worker and a Shia, also votes for Maliki. During Saddam’s tenure, he spent three months in jail and was tortured. <em>“We worked in the field, and they wanted us to join the Baath party. We were angry and that’s why they put me behind bars,”</em> he told me. He cannot become an MP himself. <em>“You need to have a degree to be eligible. But it’s not something that I worry about. We need people in power with a good educational background.”</em> According to him, each poster of the 9,000 candidates features their profession as a key part of their campaign. It’s because people vote for their doctor, their engineer, or PhD holder that everyone in the tribe is proud of. </p><p> A US-leaning prosperous Iraqi points to a poster with pride: <em>“She’s from my tribe.”</em> </p><p> Many US journalists don’t like al-Maliki because he doesn’t smile or laugh or talk like Western people. They don’t understand that Iraqis will never trust a person who laughs out loud or shows his teeth in a broad smile. It’s not the way they do it here; a leader must be reserved. The journalists believe Maliki is following Saddam’s style, but in a decent way. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156160-gas-rally-donetsk-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Tear gas in Ukraine’s Donetsk as activists seize Prosecutor’s Office (PHOTOS)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156160-gas-rally-donetsk-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/20/00/00/rally-donetsk-ukraine.jpg" title="Federalization supporters storm the Donetsk Region's prosecutor's office in Ukraine May 1, 2014  (RIA Novosti / Vitaliy Belousov)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 12:36:51 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/20/00/00/rally-donetsk-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />May Day celebrations in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, have turned violent as pro-autonomy activists seized the local Prosecutor’s Office.

Waving hammer and sickle flags, they chanted: <em>“Fascism will not pass</em>,” and sang Soviet songs. </p><p> Later in the day, the communist march was followed by several thousands of anti-government protesters taking to the streets to demand a referendum on more autonomy from Kiev and a release of anti-government protesters. </p><p> </p><p> Activists staged a rally in the city center calling for a boycott on the upcoming presidential elections. They also demanded freedom for the “people’s governor” of Donetsk”, <a href="http://rt.com/news/154872-gubarev-protest-ukraine-slavyansk/" target="_blank">Pavel Gubarev</a>, who has been under arrest in Kiev since early March. </p><h2> Thousands demonstrate for autonomy in eastern Ukraine on May Day </h2><p> May Day, also known as International Worker's Day, was marked by demonstrations in cities across southeastern Ukraine on Thursday. </p><p> In Odessa, a port city on the Black Sea, about 2,000 activists – including supporters of the federalization of Ukraine and leftists – held a march to mark the holiday, which used to be one of the most important days during the Soviet era. </p><p> Activists from the People’s Alternative movement set up a tent camp in the city center to collect signatures in support of a referendum that would give regions more autonomy and grant the Russian language status of the second official language in Ukraine, Itar-Tass reported. </p><p> </p><p> Protesters vowed to stay at the site until authorities fulfilled their demands regarding a popular vote and released all protesters arrested by Ukrainian security services. </p><p> “<em>We want to build a bright future and take all the best we had in the past.

The UN body warned that if the plan is not revised, the Reef's World Heritage status could be downgraded.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1c/40/00/unesco-barrier-reef-dumping-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Australia's Great Barrier Reef (AFP Photo)" /> <p> The <a href="http://rt.com/news/barrier-reef-coal-mud-448/" target="_blank">decision</a> to allow three million cubic meters of dredge waste to be disposed of in the Barrier Reef was made in January by an Australian government agency overseeing the area. The waste comes from the earlier approved expansion of the country’s port of Abbot Point – to make way for extensive coal shipments. <br><br> In its first comment on the issue, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) expressed “<em>concern</em>” and “<em>regret</em>” at the decision, which it believes was premature. It was taken before a thorough analysis of the impact it might have on the World Heritage site. <br><br> “<em>Indeed, this was approved, despite an indication that less impacting disposal alternatives may exist,</em>’’ UNESCO said on Thursday in a draft report on the reef's World Heritage status to the World Heritage Committee. <br><br> The body has urged the government to reconsider the dumping plan and in case it proves to be the least damaging option, submit evidence proving the point. <br><br> UNESCO has on the whole noted “<em>serious decline in the condition of the Great Barrier Reef, including in coral recruitment and reef-building across extensive parts of the property</em>." <br><br> It expects Australia to come up with a new report on its efforts for preserving the Great Barrier Reef by February 1, 2015. If that one fails to convince the UN body that the country is doing enough in challenging the World Heritage site’s deterioration, the Great Barrier Reef could be placed on an “<em>in Danger</em>” list, the draft report warns. <br><br></p><p> </p><p> The UN body’s criticism of the dredge waste dumping plan has been welcome by environmentalists. <br><br> "<em>UNESCO'S concern is shared by thousands of Australians and hundreds of leading scientists, and we call on the federal government to ban dumping of dredge in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area prior to the World Heritage Committee meeting in June</em>," WWF Australia spokesman, Richard Leck, said in a statement. <br><br> Government officials, both federal and those in Queensland (where the controversial port expansion is to take place) have produced optimistic comments on the UNESCO report, saying that they will not allow the downgrading of the Reef. <br><br> "<em>I'm very confident that between the work we're doing as a state and the work we're doing with our federal counterparts, we will not see the Reef listed 'in danger'</em>," Queensland's Environment Minister Andrew Powell said, as cited by ABC. <br><br> Once implemented, the project for the creation of a multi-billion-dollar coal port near the Great Barrier Reef would allow for yearly exports of 120 million tons of coal. <br><br> This has also been a matter of concern for environmentalists, who have criticized the project for doubling shipping traffic in the area. <br><br> UNESCO declared the Great Barrier Reef a World Heritage site in 1981. The area, covering some 350,000 square kilometers, is nearly the size of the US state of Montana. It is home to over 2,000 fish species, with new ones being discovered each year. There are also around 4,000 species of coral in the area. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155920-radical-islam/</guid><title><![CDATA[The gravest threat to stability in the Middle East?

It is growing. It is spreading across the world. It is destabilising communities and even nations. It is undermining the possibility of peaceful co-existence in an era of globalisation. And in the face of this threat we seem curiously reluctant to acknowledge it and powerless to counter it effectively."</em> </p><p> In the very same speech, however, Blair reveals that cognitive dissonance is a psychological condition common to Western ideologues such as himself. He said: <em>“We call for the regime to change in Syria, we encourage the opposition to rise up, but then when Iran activates Hezbollah on the side of Assad, we refrain even from air intervention to give the opposition a chance.”</em> </p><p> The opposition Blair refers to in Syria is primarily made up of the very radical Islamists he describes as the greatest threat to the Middle East and, by extension, the world. He can’t have it both ways. He can’t be against radical Islam on the one hand, yet call for those governments and peoples that are engaged in a life and death struggle against radical Islam to be defeated on the other. </p><p> But Tony Blair also has to answer for his own role in radicalising Muslims. Not only did the wars he advocated and participated in as UK Prime Minister result in chaos and carnage on a biblical scale in the Arab and Muslim worlds, they have led directly to the proliferation of the regressive ideology he now sees fit to rail against. The war in Iraq left the country devastated and has led inexorably to a society polarised along sectarian lines, with extreme violence a daily occurrence over a decade on. Blair’s role in the continuing controversy over the legality of the war has seen his political credibility torn to shreds, with repeated calls for him to face war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court in The Hague following him wherever he goes. </p><p> Yet rather than demonstrate any regret over his role in the disaster of Iraq, it has reached the stage where no drumbeat to war would be complete without the former prime minister banging the loudest. This was confirmed by his response to the vote taken by Parliament in the UK to exclude Britain from any military action against Syria in 2013. Like that embarrassing uncle who ruins every family social gathering with his propensity for saying and doing the most outrageous things, offending everyone in the process, up popped the former prime minister in an interview with the BBC lamenting Britain's historic break from Washington's coattails on the matter of military intervention for the first time in a generation. </p><p> For a man who has made a career, both in and out of British politics, as a proponent of might is right, this was tantamount to sacrilege. And for someone imbued with the belief that Britain's influence in the world is in direct proportion to its willingness to hurl cruise missiles at wherever Washington wants them hurled, it marked nothing less than the nation's ruin. </p><p> </p><p> At least Blair admitted in the BBC interview that the decision taken by the UK Parliament – an institution he treated with such naked contempt whilst Prime Minister - on Syria was heavily influenced by Iraq, the foreign policy disaster which he co-authored and pushed through with George W Bush. </p><p> You might think that even the hint of a lesson from this disaster may have been learned. But, no, the former prime minister’s only regret was over how it had made Britain <em>"hesitant"</em> to repeat it with regard to Syria. </p><p> This to be sure reveals the skewed outlook of a man so occluded from reality in the rarefied world of private jets, corporate boardrooms, and luxury homes and hotel suites he now inhabits, he no longer knows his political arse from his elbow. Not that he ever did, of course, but when prime minister he at least tried to give the impression that his feet were situated somewhere in the vicinity of Planet Earth. </p><p> For let us be under no illusion what the proposed military intervention in Syria would have involved. It would have involved the West entering into a de facto military alliance with – wait for it – radical Islam, given that various radical Islamist armed groups were by then dominating the opposition forces fighting in Syria. </p><p> Moreover, the justification for this proposed military action against the Syrian government at the time - i.e. humanitarian intervention bypassing the UN - would have constituted a breach of international law. No provision exists within the Fourth Geneva Convention<a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5"></a> for one state or any constellation of states to take aggressive military action on this basis. <em>‘Humanitarian Intervention’</em>, it should be noted, is a concept out of the Tony Blair handbook. It was first rolled out to justify NATO’s 1999 air war against the Serbian people in the former Yugoslavia. </p><p> In truth the gravest threat to stability in the Middle East and the world in general is not radical Islam but the Tony Blairs of this world: men who practice statecraft like gangsters, dividing up and policing their territories, smashing every obstacle in their way, interested only in power, wealth, and status. The legacy of Tony Blair is written in the blood of the untold thousands of men, women, and children slaughtered as a direct result of his messianic thirst for Western domination and hegemony. </p><p> Rather than giving speeches to handpicked audiences of the rich, justice demands that Tony Blair be forced to account for his crimes in the dock at the International Criminal Court. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156088-nsa-spies-americans-russians/</guid><title><![CDATA[NSA spies on more US citizens than Russians – Snowden]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156088-nsa-spies-americans-russians/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1b/80/00/nsa-spies-americans-russians.jpg" title="US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden (AFP Photo / Wikileaks)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 09:20:21 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1b/80/00/nsa-spies-americans-russians.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​The NSA gathers more data on American citizens than it does about foreigners, Edward Snowden has said.

He was greeted by a standing ovation from the audience when he received the Ridenhour Award for <em>“Truth-Telling."</em> </p><p> <br> During his speech, the whistleblower said he leaked thousands of classified government documents, detailing the NSA’s mass surveillance programs because <em>“it was the right thing to do, and now I see I’m not the only one who felt that way.”</em> <br><em><br> “I thought the most likely outcome would be spending the rest of my life in prison,”</em> said Snowden. <br><br> He also criticized the Senate and the House Intelligence committees for their lack of oversight on the NSA and the intelligence community. Leveling criticism at the NSA’s director, James Clapper, Snowden blasted him for his <em>“famous lie”</em> during a speech last year. <br><br> In a testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee last March, Clapper stated that the NSA did <em>“not wittingly gather any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.”</em> It was later revealed in Snowden’s documents that the agency does collect metadata indiscriminately from American telephone and internet companies. This prompted Clapper to go back on his statement, admitting it was <em>“erroneous”</em> in an apology letter to Congress. </p><p> <em>“When Clapper raised his hand and lied to the American public, was anyone tried? Were any charges brought?”</em> Snowden asked. <em>“Within 24 hours of going public, I had three charges against me.”</em> <br><br> The 30–year-old former CIA contractor-turned whistleblower is currently residing in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum last year after he fled the US. In response to the massive security leaks, Washington filed for Snowden’s extradition and charged him with theft, <em>“unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person”</em> under the Espionage Act. <br><br> Snowden’s visa will expire this June, but the whistleblower’s lawyer, Jesselyn Radack, says they are confident his visa will be extended for another year. <br><br><em>“Obviously, he misses America and would like to be able to come home,”</em> his attorney, Jesselyn Radack, told Reuters. <em>“We just don’t see that happening in the near future.”</em> <br><br> Radack added that Snowden was open for negotiation with the US Justice Department, but he will not be returning home <em>“to be prosecuted for espionage.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156124-turkey-protests-gas-cannon/</guid><title><![CDATA[Turkish police clash with May Day protesters in Istanbul]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156124-turkey-protests-gas-cannon/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1d/c0/00/turkey-protests-gas-cannon.jpg" title="A protester uses a slingshot while others take cover during a May Day demonstration in Istanbul May 1, 2014 (Reuters / Umit Bektas)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 09:06:37 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1d/c0/00/turkey-protests-gas-cannon.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A massive police operation has cracked down on May Day protests in the Turkish city of Istanbul.

Some activists threw Molotov cocktails and fireworks at police officers, who retaliated with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. </p><p> <em>“I have already seen a few people injured,”</em> said RT correspondent Sara Firth, who was caught in tear gas and water cannon fire whilst trying to film on the streets of Istanbul. <em>“It shows no signs of letting up at the moment.”</em> </p><p> <a class="video-link-autoprocess" href="/files/news/26/1d/c0/00/sara_web_480p.mp4">Video: /files/news/26/1d/c0/00/sara_web_480p.mp4</a> </p><p> The tear-gassing was so intense in the Besiktas district that some families were forced to evacuate their homes, reported Turkish news agency Hurriyet. </p><p> At least 142 protesters have been detained by police and 90 people, 19 of whom are police officers, have been injured during the protests, according to the Istanbul Governor’s Office. The Hurriyet Daily notes that the number of injured does not include those treated outside of hospitals. </p><p> </p><p> Istanbul’s authorities have taken special measures to ensure protesters do not gain access to Taksim Square, which has become a symbol for the city’s anti-government protest movement. Local press reports that at least 30 special operations units have been deployed around Gezi Park - adjacent to Taksim Square – as well as armored vehicles. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Protestors being detained by police after a clash as they tried to push past police line <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Istanbul&amp;src=hash">#Istanbul</a><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23May1&amp;src=hash">#May1</a><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%231mayis&amp;src=hash">#1mayis</a><a href="http://t.co/ZlmDmgogpp">pic.twitter.com/ZlmDmgogpp</a> </p> <p> — Sara Firth (@SaraFirth_RT) <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraFirth_RT/statuses/461811676640468993">May 1, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> In addition, the Turkish police have also deployed specially designed, portable, steel walls for the first time.

Local media also reported that almost 40,000 police had been deployed throughout the city to prevent May Day Protests. </p><p> </p><p> Prime Minister Taiyyip Erdogan, who has been the target of many anti-government protests, told citizens they should <em>“give up hope”</em> of gaining access to Taksim Square on May 1. However, Turkey’s main trade unions issued a statement on Wednesday calling the ban <em>“irrational”</em> and <em>“illegal”</em> and pledged to hold demonstrations on the square. <br><br><em>“All roads will lead to Taksim on May Day, and our struggle for labor, equality, freedom, justice and peace will continue,"</em> the main unions said in a joint statement on Wednesday. </p><p> Many of the demonstrators took to the streets to commemorate protesters who died in last year’s unrest. </p><p> Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has condemned the protest movement, dismissing demonstrators as <em>“terrorists”</em> and <em>“riff raff.”</em> The Turkish leader has come under fire for what his opposition regard as heavy-handed measures prior to his reelection this March. </p><p> </p><p> Following the dissemination of leaked conversations between government officials in social media, Erdogan ordered Twitter and YouTube to be blocked on March 21. <br><br> In the leaks, government officials discuss a possible plan for military intervention in Syria. <br><br> The Turkish government was obliged to lift a ban on Twitter on March 26 following a Constitutional Court ruling that called the site blockade unconstitutional.

This is a ten-fold increase compared to 2005, when around 130,000 people were using the drug. </p><p> Afghanistan is responsible for about three-quarters of the world’s heroin production, with much of it being cultivated in the Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the south of the country. However, the US has concentrated most of its efforts in the east of Afghanistan, which has relatively little poppy production, as it is safer than working in the south. </p><p> Attempts to limit production and seize heroin have not been helped due to a downscaling of operations by the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force). In 2013, coalition forces managed to seize 41,000 kilograms of opium out of the 5.5 million kilograms produced in Afghanistan. </p><p> <em>“Drug labs, storage sites, and major trafficking networks are concentrated in rural areas that are increasingly off-limits to Afghan forces due the ISAF drawdown and declining security in these areas,”</em> the report found. </p><p> Since NATO began its ‘War on Terror’ in 2001, heroin production in Afghanistan has increased <a href="http://rt.com/news/afghanistan-election-drugs-production-753/" target="_blank">40-fold</a>, according to the head of Russia’s Federal Drug Control Service. <em>“Afghan heroin has killed more than 1 million people worldwide since ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ began, and over $1 trillion has been invested in transnational organized crime from drug sales,”</em> <a href="http://rt.com/news/nato-afghanistan-anti-narcotics-085/" target="_blank">Viktor Ivanov</a> said earlier at a conference on the Afghan drug problem in 2013. </p><p> Moscow has repeatedly pushed for the eradication of poppy fields in Afghanistan as the simplest solution. NATO, however, seems to have no intention of doing so. </p><p> In 2013, the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics reported that just 7,300 hectares of poppy fields had been destroyed, which was only three percent of the total opium fields in the country. The US has spent $7.5 billion since 2002 trying to combat the problem of opium production. However, despite these vast sums very little impact has been made on the amount of heroin appearing on the world market. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156132-florida-prison-gas-explosion/</guid><title><![CDATA[2 dead, 100-150 injured in explosion at Florida prison - police]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156132-florida-prison-gas-explosion/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1e/40/00/florida-prison-gas-explosion-1.jpg" title="Escambia County Jail facility (Image from google.maps.com)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 08:50:07 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1e/40/00/florida-prison-gas-explosion-1.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />At least 2 people have been killed and 100 injured in a gas explosion at a jail in Pensacola, Florida, according to a spokeswoman.

The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) revealed that BP officials found the mist during a routine inspection on Monday. </p><p> Initial reports said that 27 acres had been covered, although that figure was updated later on Wednesday. The cause is still under investigation, according to the <a href="http://fuelfix.com/blog/2014/04/30/oily-mist-sprayed-over-27-acres-at-prudhoe-bay/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>, but officials know that the mist was made up of a mixture of gas, crude oil, and water. They also reported that while the noxious mist was distributed over such a wide area by 30 mph winds, no wildlife was impacted. </p><p> BP spokeswoman Dawn Patience said the company is “<em>still assessing repairs”</em> and will soon know what, if any, long-term effects the spill could have. </p><p> The Prudhoe Bay region, like elsewhere in the North Slope, is home to a great number of migratory birds and caribou, as well as other animals, such as a massive porcupine herd. Clean-up efforts are expected to be complete before birds pass through the region again in the coming weeks. </p><p> The company was at fault in at least two oil spills in the same region since 2006. That year, an estimated 267,000 gallons of oil seeped through a quarter-inch sized hole in a corroded BP pipeline. That accident went unnoticed for five days, until an oil worker smelled the aroma of crude when driving through the area, according to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/04/30/3432602/bp-oil-spray/" target="_blank">Think Progress</a>. </p><p> The company spent $500 million on upgrading 16 miles of pipeline that transported oil into a processing facility dubbed Gathering Center 2. </p><p> Instead of acting as a warning to the company, though, the 2006 spill only served as a preview for a 2009 spill that sent approximately 14,000 gallons from a pipeline into the tundra and wetlands of Prudhoe Bay. </p><p> “<em>The 2009 spill vividly demonstrates that BP has not adequately addressed the management and environmental compliance problems that have plagued it for many years</em>,” US government lawyers said in a court filing that sought to levy steep fines onto BP, as quoted by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-29/bp-pipeline-rupture-may-force-company-to-pay-more-for-2006-spill.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>. </p><p> “<em>This rupture was the result of a predictable and preventable freezing of produced water within the pipeline that caused the pipe to over-pressurize and burst. Eerily similar to the 2006 spill, BP ignored alarms that warned of the pipe’s eventual rupture and leak</em>.” </p><p> Officials made the most recent finding less than a week after a report from the US National Research Council (NRC) announced that regulators are not prepared to effectively respond to an Arctic oil spill. The 198-page assessment authored by scientists at the request of the American Petroleum Institute and the Coast Guard found that while more research still needs to be done, the current situation is bleak. </p><p> “<em>The lack of infrastructure in the Arctic would be a significant liability in the event of a large oil spill,</em>” the report stated, as quoted by the <a href="http://fuelfix.com/blog/2014/04/23/report-us-ill-prepared-to-tackle-arctic-oil-spills/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>. “<em>It is unlikely that responders could quickly react to an oil spill unless there were improved port and air access, stronger supply chains and increased capacity to handle equipment, supplies and personnel</em>.” </p><p> Most of the information regulators have gathered on how to respond to oil spills comes from warmer areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico – the site of another massive BP oil spill in April 2010. Yet the drilling areas far to the north remain largely isolated from the resources in the Gulf, with the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest deep water port. </p><p> As such, the NRC recommended the US quickly institute “<em>a comprehensive, collaborative, long-term Arctic oil spill research and development program</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/156080-ukraine-gas-debt-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia reaches $3.5 bn]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/156080-ukraine-gas-debt-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1b/00/00/ukraine-gas-debt-russia.jpg" title="Reuters / Stringer"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 03:12:07 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1b/00/00/ukraine-gas-debt-russia.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia has hit $3.5 billion, according to preliminary data released on Wednesday, a Gazprom official told reporters.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1b/00/00/ukraine-gas-debt-russia.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Stringer" /> <p> The new data includes Ukraine’s Naftogaz order as of April 30 and those volumes that were already supplied this month, Sergey Kupriyanov stated. </p><p> Ukraine's energy minister, Yury Prodan, responded, stating that Ukraine does now agree with Russia’s gas debt estimate of US$3.5 billion, UNN news agency reported. Prodan added that Ukraine continues to insist on the price of $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters for Russian gas. </p><p> Last week, Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said that Ukraine’s growing gas debt may lead to the failure of the country’s <a href="http://rt.com/business/155100-ukraine-gas-debt-eu/" target="_blank">transit</a> obligations and the reduction of gas supplies to southeastern Europe. </p><p> The debt may force a situation where not enough gas will be pumped into Ukrainian underground storage facilities, which may create the risk of non-performance by Ukraine of its transit obligations and of an undersupply of gas to southeastern Europe, the minister stated. </p><p> In December, Russia provided Ukraine with a $3 billion loan, which was part of a larger $15 billion aid package agreed the same month. Moscow also offered a 33 percent gas price discount that would have saved more than $7.5 billion. </p><p> In April, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that Russia cannot continue to <a href="http://rt.com/business/putin-ukraine-economy-gas-353/" target="_blank">prop up</a> Ukraine’s faltering economy. </p><p> <em>“The Russian Federation doesn’t recognize the legitimacy of the authorities in Kiev, but it keeps providing economic support and subsidizing the economy of Ukraine with hundreds of millions and billions of dollars.

Once it was more widespread among the Cuban population, it would introduce political content that would attempt to inspire Cubans to <em>"renegotiate the balance of power between the state and society.”</em> </p><p> Despite the State Department’s assertions that the program was not used to influence political leanings, AP reported Wednesday that cell phone users were categorized in databases as being <em>“pro-revolution,” “apolitical,”</em> or <em>“anti-revolutionary.”</em> </p><p> One young contractor working on the project was Paula Cambronero, whose first job out of college was working on how Cubans interacted with ZunZuneo messages carefully – and quietly – sent from Spanish phone numbers. The contractor asked Cambronero to communicate with staff over encrypted channels, and emails were sent from a domain name “not publicly linked” to the contractor. </p><p> Her employer – not named by AP – told her that she would be dealing with a <em>"considerable amount of sensitive information that must be safeguarded to protect critical operations of the Project."</em> USAID even established a dummy company in the Cayman Islands to cover any money trail associated with ZunZuneo. </p><p> Cambronero’s responsibility was to build a database of unsuspecting Cuban cell phone users that responded to ZunZuneo messages, using classifications like gender, age, location, <em>“receptiveness,”</em> and <em>“political tendencies.”</em> She would analyze how users reacted to overtly political messages written by a hired Cuban satirist that poked at the nation’s leaders. </p><p> Cambronero did not respond to AP’s request for comment. The State Department had no comment to AP on Wednesday. </p><p> </p><p> On Tuesday, USAID spokesman Matthew Herrick told AP that the agency had reviewed the project and offered congressional investigators the selection of messages sent to Cubans. </p><p> Herrick claimed the 249 different messages focused on sports, technology, world news, and trivia, and that the messages <em>"were consistent with the objective of creating a platform for Cubans to speak freely among themselves."</em> </p><p> The political messages crafted by the satirist were sent <em>“under a grant that pre-dated the ZunZuneo project,”</em> Herrick said. </p><p> Yet documents reviewed by AP show that USAID considered the grant a <em>“test phase”</em> of the network that would become ZunZuneo. </p><p> Overall, Cambronero collected more than 700 responses to text messages, analyzing them by two variables: the level of interest in the received messages and the political content of a response. </p><p> She found that 68 percent of responses exhibited mild interest in the ZunZuneo texts. Many responses – 210 total – wanted to know who was sending the anonymous message. </p><p> <em>"Explain your point better because I don't understand and remember that if you haven't done anything you shouldn't fear anything, at least tell me your name if you're not a coward,"</em> said one respondent. </p><p> Others asked for help in obtaining birth certificates of Spanish ancestors, a prerequisite for acquiring a Spanish passport to leave Cuba. </p><p> Only 59 responses were analyzed for political content. Cambronero found 10 that did have <em>“political character,”</em> AP reported, <em>“of which two were counter-revolutionary.”</em> </p><p> In her notes, Cambronero recommended that <em>"messages with a humorous connotation should not contain a strong political tendency, so as not to create animosity in the recipients."</em> </p><p> Upon the ZunZuneo revelations, the Obama administration quickly came under attack and promptly denounced allegations that it covertly plotted to disrupt Cuban politics. </p><p> Condemnation of the program continues to emerge. In Costa Rica, where ZunZuneo was reportedly developed by American officials, the nation’s foreign minister Enrique Castillo <a href="http://rt.com/usa/154624-costa-rica-cuban-twitter/" target="_blank">said</a> last week that not only does he think it was <em>“inappropriate”</em> for the US to use his country to conduct the project, but that he previously warned officials not to involve his Central American country in the endeavor due to fears it would strain Costa Rica’s own relationship with Cuba. </p><p> <em>"I think it's inappropriate to use an embassy in Costa Rica for this type of operation that harms a third country,"</em> Castillo told the AP. <em>"We're not filing a complaint. The point is that embassies accredited in Costa Rica don't have to submit their plans or programs for the Costa Rican government's approval."</em> </p><p> Costa Rica’s minister of communications, Carlos Roverssi, said Wednesday that it will fall on the country’s recently elected government to deal with the matter from here on out. </p><p> <em>"It seems to me that the issue is now public and the next government should follow up on the issue, without a doubt,"</em> he said. </p><p> The US State Department has begun a review of the program, saying it would be <em>“troubling”</em> if ZunZuneo involved political messaging. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156060-lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut/</guid><title><![CDATA[Advocates decry transfer of transgender teen to adult male prison]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156060-lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/c0/00/lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut.jpg" title="Reuters / Dario Pignatelli"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 01:06:32 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/c0/00/lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A judge’s decision to send a troubled 16-year-old transgender teen to a Connecticut prison for adults has alarmed her lawyer and advocates who say the girl, charged with no crime, should be placed in the hands of a caring family.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/c0/00/lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Dario Pignatelli" /> <p> Identified only as Jane Doe, the youth identifies as a female. She has been under the care of the state since the age of five, when social workers removed her from her family’s home – her father was in jail and her mother was battling an addiction to crack, heroin, and alcohol. </p><p> She was brutally abused multiple times while in the care of the Department of Children and Families (DCF). In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1113035-4-14-14affidavit-redacted-reduced.html" target="_blank">court papers</a> filed this month, she claims that she was repeatedly raped while having her life threatened by being punched, kicked, and bashed in the head by family members for playing with dolls. </p><p> “<em>At about age 12 I was placed by DCF at a residential facility in Eagleton School in Massachusetts, where a worker named [redacted] used to show the other children pornographic magazines, and on two occasions I was in his office and he had me perform oral sex on him</em>,” she said, among other heinous incidents. </p><p> Authorities said the teen was removed from the care of DCF after attacking a staff member in an assault that left the employee temporarily blinded and with a broken jaw. Despite filing no charges against the girl, the state transferred her to a women’s prison in East Lyme, Connecticut, where she has been kept in her cell for 22 to 23 hours a day in a wing for mentally ill inmates. </p><p> “<em>We are sensitive to the traumatic and difficult experiences the youth has encountered over her life</em>,” said a DCF statement issued earlier this month. “The judge who issued the transfer order heard evidence over a six-day period in which there was ample evidence provided by numerous witnesses stating under oath that the youth has propensity for violence. </p><p> “<em>The youth has an extensive history of violence, including targeting female staff at several programs as well as other girls in the program</em>,” the statement went on. </p><p> Advocates disagreed with that decision, saying that if the allegations of assault are indeed correct, it’s only natural for such a troubled youth to react in unpredictable ways. </p><p> “<em>This is a youth that has not been convicted of an adult crime in an adult court that is now being placed in an adult correctional facility</em>,” Connecticut state child advocate Sarah Egan told <a href="http://wnpr.org/post/transgender-teen-sent-connecticut-adult-prison" target="_blank">WNPR</a> radio. “<em>This is a tremendously unusual and concerning action by the state against a 16-year-old</em>.” </p><p> The situation has struck some observers as curious because the DCF recently opened the Solnit Center in Middletown, Connecticut, a home for girls with serious emotional issues. The DCF commissioner told WNPR that residents there “<em>have been the victims of trauma; they have been abused; sexually abused, whatever the circumstances are, and they need that much more of an intensive-based treatment</em>.” </p><p> Earlier this month, Aaron Romano, the girl’s attorney, pressed for a court order that would have made the situation even worse. Romano told the <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-transgender-juvenile-sent-to-prison-20140409,0,6060233.story?page=1" target="_blank">Hartford Courant</a> there is a risk that the transgender teen could be transferred to the Marion Correctional Institution, a prison for males under 21 years of age. </p><p> “<em>This is really an embarrassment for DCF and the state on several levels</em>,” he said. “<em>Had DCF followed through in its child-protection mandate, this child would now be at Middletown juvenile facility</em>.” </p><p> The American Civil Liberties Union and GLAAD (formerly known as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) have spoken out against the possible transfer. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156068-revived-silk-road-bigger/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Revived’ illicit online bazaar Silk Road ‘bigger than ever’ as Feds fail to keep up]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156068-revived-silk-road-bigger/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1a/40/00/silk-road.jpg" title="Image from the Digital Citizens Alliance report"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 01:06:14 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1a/40/00/silk-road.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The notorious website Silk Road – which served as a middleman that allowed its customers to anonymously buy drugs, weapons, and criminal software – is more popular than ever, despite the arrest of its founder six months ago, says a new report.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1a/40/00/silk-road.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Image from the Digital Citizens Alliance report" /> <p> “<em>Approximately 13,648 listings for drugs are now available on Silk Road compared to the 13,000 that were listed shortly before the FBI arrested Ross William Ulbricht and shut down the site. The Darknet drug economy as a whole contains 75 percent more listings for drugs,</em>” claims a newly published <a href="https://media.gractions.com/314A5A5A9ABBBBC5E3BD824CF47C46EF4B9D3A76/5f8d4168-c36a-4f78-b048-f5d48b18dc0a.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the Digital Citizens Alliance, a public group dedicated to reducing online crime. <br><br> Though US authorities have charged Ulbricht with conspiracy to distribute narcotics, for designing and operating the website that allowed users to buy anything apart from child pornography and weapons of mass destruction, his website has been reopened with an identical interface to reassure loyal buyers. <br><br> Even Ulbricht’s alleged moniker, Dread Pirate Roberts, has been appropriated by another administrator, who users refer to as DPR2. <br><br> February’s theft of users’ virtual currency bitcoin – worth more than $2.6 million – only seems to have “<em>reassured</em>” users. The administrators of the site have promised to repay the money instead of shutting off services and disappearing as others have done on the so-called 'Darknet' – an unregulated part of the internet accessed through anonymous software. <br><br> The detentions of three more people possibly connected to the operation, and rumors of further arrests, have not dampened interests, either. <br><br> “<em>The last six months have tested the wherewithal of the Darknet Marketplaces. Arrests, site seizures, scams from small to massive, and an ever-increasing amount of paranoia have challenged those who buy and sell illicit goods online. The Marketplaces have proven resilient and as one closes or disappears, several others pop up to take its place</em>,” alleges the report. <br><br> An appendix provided with the report shows that every single one of the most popular traders on the original Silk Road site either continues to trade there, or has moved onto other services. <br><br> The report's authors say they are not only worried about drugs, but also the general platform that Silk Road provides. <br><br> “<em>While the brazen sales of heroin and crystal meth attract attention, the real money is in underground financial transactions...The true value of Silk Road in the criminal underground is more than drugs; it is the further enabling of secret illicit activity.”</em> <br><br> The Digital Citizens Alliance has chided legislators and government agencies for being unable to keep up with the criminals. <br><br> “<em>The government in general struggles with developing any internet policy, and the cryptonet debate seems even more fraught with apathy,</em>” states the report. <br><br> But few solutions seem apparent. <br><br> “<em>The policy development areas for [anonymizer software] Tor, bitcoin, and Darknet Marketplaces are wide open. US states may see the need to create their own policies or recommend federal ones. States may see the need to regulate bitcoin exchanges in their own jurisdictions or require internet service providers to block Tor use locally, regardless of how technically implausible it might be. This is a brave new world of policy analysis,</em>” the report states. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156048-gary-johnson-us-politics-today/</guid><title><![CDATA[US involvement in Ukraine is like ‘Russia getting involved in Puerto Rico’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156048-gary-johnson-us-politics-today/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/00/00/1gary-johnson-us-politics-today.jpg" title="Gary Johnson"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 00:29:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/00/00/1gary-johnson-us-politics-today.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Though Republicans hold a majority of seats in the House of Representatives and Democrats hold a majority of seats in the Senate, a majority of Americans say that neither party represents them.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/00/00/1gary-johnson-us-politics-today.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Gary Johnson" /> <p> According to a new national survey by Rasmussen, 53 percent of likely US voters think that neither political party truly represents the American people. The poll shows that the two-party system is losing ground with Americans – six months ago, in October, only 46 percent of questioned voters said that neither party represents Americans. </p><p> RT’s Lindsay France spoke with 2012 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson about Americans’ lack of representation in the halls of political power. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Now let’s talk about this lack of representation. Seventy-two percent say it would be better if the country didn’t elect the incumbents to Congress this year in November. If they don’t trust either party, the incumbents or the new guys, what’s the alternative? </p><p> <strong>Gary Johnson:</strong> Well, first of all, I agree with the poll. I think this is what we’re all witnessing. I think term limits would really be a silver bullet, the notion that people would get in, do the right thing and get out. And then, Lindsay, you know, a couple of issues of late that really left all the politicians behind: the marriage equality, nobody was standing up for that; the marijuana legalization, the state of Washington, the state of Colorado moving ahead of all politicians; and then if you look at Libya and Syria, the president’s ready to go in militarily, Congress is ready to dot the i’s and cross the t’s on how to do that and, lo and behold, 80 percent of Americans don’t want to do that. Well that’s a good thing. I just wish that Congress would catch up to the fact that this spending is not sustainable and, if they don’t fix this, we’re going to find ourselves in a monetary crisis. We’re going to find ourselves without a country. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about government trust among young voters, those between the ages of about 18 and 29. A new poll surveying young Americans’ political attitudes released by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics [on] Tuesday, found that the millennials’ 'composite trust index,' it’s called, which is the level of trust, on average, in six different public institutions: the presidency, the US military, the Supreme Court, the federal government, and the United Nations, it’s dropped dramatically in just two years...from 39 two years ago down to 31 in mid-April...How do politicians come back from this sort of a drop? We’re talking about the young generation, the young voters here. </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Lindsay, I know you have statistics there on young voters, but I believe that it isn’t just young voters. I think that they are the canary, though, in the coal mine, and that, if politicians don’t get in touch with this, that, really, we’re going to find ourselves...I do already think we’re in a catastrophe of sorts in that we’re not being represented. Of course, having run for the Libertarian nomination for president, I can tell you that whether you’re a Libertarian, whether you’re a Democrat, whether you’re a Republican, you have baggage whether you have that baggage or not. We’re suing the Presidential Debates Commission right now to say if mathematically you are a party that can conceivably be elected president of the United States with enough electoral votes, then shouldn’t you be included in the debates? Just give another voice out there, and the more voices we have with input on where this country should go, I suggest we’ll all be a lot better off. But it is a two-party system, and it’s very exclusionary. I found that out face-to-face. It’s not a good thing. More voices, the better. And I’m not being hypocritical here. As governor of New Mexico, I made it as easy as, I signed legislation making it as easy as possible for third parties to be able to run. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about these other voices. You know, even after the midterm elections, President Obama’s got a while left in the White House. He’s facing <a href="http://rt.com/usa/155720-obama-approval-lowest-of-term/" target="_blank">very low approval ratings</a> right now – extremely low, embarrassingly low. What does this midterm election look like? Can it change things? Will new voices, depending on who makes it in through the midterm elections, change his approval ratings? Will they be able to steer him away from some of those bad decisions? </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I don’t place blame on Obama, I do place blame on the system that is very status quo oriented, that more than anything politicians are concerned with getting reelected, as opposed to doing the right thing...When people don’t vote, it’s a, you know, that’s not a good thing. And maybe we’ll see some huge voter turnout. I have no optimism whatsoever that anything changes in Washington as a result of these midterm elections. Look, I think that the president should be a leader and that he should be controversial and that he should press the things that he wants to do. And Republicans, they should be leading on the issues that they should be strong on, and that would be spending and that would be the deficit. And then both parties, they ought to come together on issues that everybody cares about. I think the majority of Americans – speaking with a broad brushstroke – are fiscally responsible and socially liberal. I always tell people I’m as conservative a politician as you’ve ever met when it comes to dollars and cents, and I’m a flaming liberal when it comes to civil liberties. The militarization of our police forces, this is happening under the guise of both political parties watching this. I mean, it’s getting so bad. One-hundred-and-ten million Verizon users are being monitored by the NSA. This is happening under the eyes of both political parties. There just doesn’t seem to be any hope out there. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about our foreign involvements, which most people will say have been numerous lately. As the saying goes, “Go big or go home.” Well, we’ve gone big, and now it appears it’s time to go home. According to nearly half of the respondents from an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 47 percent of them say the US should become less active in world affairs. Now if you look at what’s going on: US involvement in Ukraine, the Iraq debacle, troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, trying to go into Syria, Libya before that, what is the way forward for those who want votes this election season, with all of the concern Americans feel on these issues? </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Well, the way politicians address this of course is to get tough, drop bombs. I mean, Republicans are all about who’s going to drop the first bomb? What about the notion of free trade? Gosh, is China really an enemy when they’re, you know, our second biggest trading partner? I don’t think so! We should be looking at trade with other countries first and foremost...You don’t go to war against trading partners. But yet we’re always talking about sanctions, and sanctions just don’t work. And when you look at Ukraine right now, I think that would be analogous to Russia getting involved in Puerto Rico. They’re not going to do it. We shouldn’t get involved in Ukraine. There are unintended consequences as a result of our military interventions. I’m going to suggest that we have hundreds of millions of enemies to this country because of our military interventions. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about Ukraine for a minute. Obviously it’s a hot spot in world topics...How should the US approach the crisis in Ukraine? Should the US do more or less? </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Well, less! Look, don’t get involved in Ukraine! It would be like Russia getting involved in the affairs of Puerto Rico. They’re not going to do it! We shouldn’t be involved in Ukraine! There’s no national security interest here at stake. And I know you’ll hear politicians beating their chests, arguing the opposite. Well, I’m going to argue that there is no national security interest here at risk, and the government has an obligation to protect us against foreign governments that might do us harm – this is not one of those situations. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156036-one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘One nation under Allah’: FL conservatives push for anti-Sharia legislation]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156036-one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/40/00/one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria.jpg" title="Rocky Mountain High School, Colorado (Image from 999thepoint.com)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 22:46:21 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/18/40/00/one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Florida conservatives, evidently alarmed by changing social and income demographics, are pushing legislation to combat what they say is the attempted indoctrination of American students with Islamic ideology.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/40/00/one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Rocky Mountain High School, Colorado (Image from 999thepoint.com)" /> <p> Lawmakers are currently considering a so-called “<em>anti-Sharia bill</em>” which passed through the state Senate with a 24-14 vote on Monday. Sharia, which varies between cultures, is the basic path which devout Muslims try to follow. The rules, while strict by Western standards, often stretch past the confines of a mosque and regulate aspects of secular law, including crime, public policy, sex, diet, and economics. </p><p> “<em>Those people who want to come to America, we welcome them, but when you come to America, you are going to be governed under American laws, when you come to Florida you are going to be governed by Florida laws, and we ought not to apologize for that</em>,” Sen. Alan Hays, a Republican, told the <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/blogs/political-pulse/sfl-state-senators-advance-controversial-antisharia-bill-20140428,0,4912559.post" target="_blank">Orlando Sentinel</a> after the bill passed through the state Senate. </p><p> While the bill will now move to the state House of Representatives for approval, members of the Senate were still wondering who, exactly, is trying to impose Islamic restrictions on the mostly Christian Florida population. According to a <a href="http://religions.pewforum.org/maps" target="_blank">recent analysis</a> from the Pew Research Center, a mere one percent of Florida's population is Muslim, compared to the 66 percent of Floridians who practice some form of Christianity. </p><p> “<em>There is no record of Sharia law being implemented in the courts of Florida or any other state</em>,” Sen. Eleanor Sobel, a Democrat who opposed the bill, told the Sentinel. </p><p> Officials were similarly confused when educators, in an apparent attempt to break down cultural barriers, came under attack from members of their community who were trying to do the opposite. </p><p> A controversy erupted in Volusia County, Florida in November when a student brought her social studies textbook home to her parents, who found that the curriculum dedicated a specific section to the history and beliefs of Islam. Experts told the Daytona News Journal that the rest of the book was full of references to Christianity and Judaism, but the first complaint blossomed into a contingency of parents who felt that their rights were somehow being infringed upon. </p><p> “<em>We hope that the School Board will respect our voices in the process of education and reject voices of intolerance and censorship</em>,” a petition calling on administrators to replace the book read. The document failed to explain how an education based on the knowledge of various religions equated to censorship. </p><p> Conservatives in Colorado were equally upset when a Muslim student led the rest of the school in the Pledge of Allegiance while replacing the traditional “<em>under God</em>” with “<em>under Allah</em>.” The pledge was adopted in US schools in 1942 at the height of World War II but was only amended to include “<em>under God</em>” a decade later, as a way for Americans to differentiate themselves from the Soviet Union’s atheism policy during the Cold War. </p><p> Colorado’s Cultural Arms Club, which advertises its mission to “<em>destroy the barriers, embrace the cultures</em>” that exist throughout the region, organized the “<em>under Allah</em>” pledge at Rocky Mountain High School. It quickly came under fire from parents who felt that it would be unpatriotic to utter the pledge in any form other than the traditional one. </p><p> “<em>These students love this country</em>,” school principal Tom Lopez told <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/school-recites-pledge-in-arabic-one-nation-under-allah.html" target="_blank">Fox News</a> at the time. “<em>They were not being un-American in trying to do this. They believed they were accentuating the meaning of the words as spoken regularly in English</em>.” </p><p> The problem, Lopez said, was not that the school was trying to be more inclusive, but that a vocal fraction of the community was so up in arms. </p><p> “<em>I’ve been shocked with prejudicial statements that have been made,”</em> he continued<em>. “I’ve been shocked with the lack of seeking understanding. There’s definitely some suspicion and fear expressed in these people’s minds. There’s some hate</em>,” he said. </p><p> Like Principal Lopez, a growing number of pundits and lawmakers have called for more information on Islamic culture and beliefs. Even now, more than a decade after religious tension heightened in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, nearly two-thirds of Americans asked about other world faiths admitted they had “<em>little or no knowledge</em>” about what Muslims believe, according to New York University professor Jonathan Zimmerman. </p><p> “<em>To live together as citizens of a nation, we need to understand each other’s fundamental assumptions and beliefs about the world</em>,” Zimmerman wrote in the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/give-kids-muslim-holidays-teach-religious-history-schools-article-1.1767687" target="_blank">New York Daily News</a>. “<em>And we can’t do that without understanding religion, which remains the basic wellspring of those beliefs for many of us</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156052-sinn-fein-adams-murder/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams detained over notorious 1972 murder]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156052-sinn-fein-adams-murder/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/40/00/sinn-fein-arrest-murder.jpg" title="Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams (Reuters / Neil Hall)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 21:46:31 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/40/00/sinn-fein-arrest-murder.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Northern Ireland police have detained and questioned Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in connection with the 1972 abduction and murder of Jean McConville by the IRA, his party said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/40/00/sinn-fein-arrest-murder.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams (Reuters / Neil Hall)" /> <p> McConville, a widowed mother of 10, was abducted from her home in west Belfast and shot by the IRA amid fierce sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. She was wrongly accused of being an informant. </p><p> Adams, 65, said in a statement that he was <em>“innocent of any part”</em> of McConville’s death, Reuters reported. Her body was recovered from a beach in County Louth in 2003. </p><p> The Police Service of Northern Ireland said in a statement that a man had “presented himself” to authorities Wednesday evening, but they did not name the suspect. </p><p> Sinn Fein said in a statement: <em>“Last month Gerry Adams said he was available to meet the PSNI about the Jean McConville case. That meeting is taking place this evening."</em> </p><p> Last month, Ivor Bell, a leader in the Provisional IRA in the 1970s, was charged with aiding and abetting McConville’s murder. Other arrests have recently been made in connection with the murder. </p><p> Bell’s case was based on an interview which he allegedly gave to researchers at Boston College in the United States. A series of candid, confessional interviews with former loyalists and republican paramilitaries was taped in an effort to provide an oral history of the Troubles. </p><p> Interviewees were told that the tapes would not be released to the public until after their deaths, but a series of court cases in the US resulted in some of the content being handed to law enforcement. </p><p> An investigation by the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman cleared McConville of accusations that she was an informant. According to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR), McConville was one of 16 people known as the <em>'Disappeared'</em> – those abducted, murdered, and buried in secret by republicans during the era of the Troubles. </p><p> The IRA admitted in 1999 that it murdered and secretly buried nine of the Disappeared. The other seven have yet to be found. The ICLVR is aimed at locating the remains of those still missing. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156056-imf-approves-ukraine-aid/</guid><title><![CDATA[IMF gives green light for $17 bn Ukraine aid package]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156056-imf-approves-ukraine-aid/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/80/00/imf-approves-ukraine-aid.jpg" title="The International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters building is seen in Washington, DC (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 21:18:47 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/80/00/imf-approves-ukraine-aid.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The International Monetary Fund has approved a two-year $17.1 billion loan package for Ukraine. The immediate disbursement of $3.2 billion will allow Ukraine to avoid a potential debt default.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/80/00/imf-approves-ukraine-aid.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="The International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters building is seen in Washington, DC (AFP Photo)" /> <p> The IMF’s 24-member board agreed to the two-year program to aid Ukraine’s troubled economy on Wednesday. </p><p> The approval gives the green light for the immediate release of $3.2 billion to Ukraine, which will allow the nation not to fall into default, Reuters reports. More than half of that money will be dedicated to supporting the country's budget. </p><p> The package will open up loans from other donors totaling around $15 billion. The goal is for Ukraine to use the money to stabilize its economy. </p><p> <em>"The authorities' economic program supported by the Fund aims to restore macroeconomic stability, strengthen economic governance and transparency, and launch sound and sustainable economic growth, while protecting the most vulnerable,</em>" the IMF said in a statement. </p><p> IMF managing director Christine Lagarde commented on the aid package, stating that the plan may come with geopolitical and implementation risks. </p><p> <em>"On the implementation front, we are taking all the precautions we can in order to mitigate those risks,"</em> Lagarde told reporters on Wednesday. <em>"On the geopolitical front, clearly the bilateral international support, and the cooperation of all parties, will be extremely helpful to reinforce the position of the economy of Ukraine.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> <em>"We believe that Ukraine has an opportunity to seize the moment, to break away from previous practices, both from the fiscal, from the monetary, and from the governance point of view,”</em> Lagarde added. </p><p> Ukraine’s crisis was exacerbated after months of anti-government protests and Crimea’s referendum to join Russia. </p><p> The country's economy is forecasted to contract by three percent due to the chaos and lack of order, according to Ukrainian authorities. The nation's output dropped 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014. </p><p> The ongoing protests, especially in the east of the country, are not helping the nation get its economy back on track. In fact, Ukraine’s acting President Aleksandr Turchinov said on Wednesday that Kiev’s government <a href="http://rt.com/news/155856-ukraine-alert-president-army/" target="_blank">cannot control</a> the situation in the east of the country, and called to speed up the creation of regional militias loyal to Kiev. </p><p> Lagarde noted that further sanctions against Russia may harm Ukraine's economy even further, as its neighboring country is a key export market for Ukraine. </p><p> <em>"Clearly on the front of sanctions, anything that undermines the economic situation of the country will jeopardize the implementation of the program, which is why we very strongly encourage the parties to negotiate, to come to terms,"</em> Lagarde said. </p><p> </p><h2> 'Bold program of reforms' </h2><p> Lagarde argued that Ukraine has already shown its ability to undertake <em>“comprehensive reforms,”</em> listing a few of the sacrifices that have been made. </p><p> <em>“Whether it was a question of letting the exchange rate float, whether it was a question of reforming the procurement law, whether it was a question of modifying the price of gas to customers or to corporate. They’ve (Ukrainian government) done all these things to demonstrate their determination to endorse a very bold program of reforms,”</em> Lagarde stated. </p><p> The IMF money comes with stringent terms, asking for various cuts and economic reforms. In the case of Ukraine, the requirements include a 50 percent increase in the price of gas for households, as well as a quick pension reform and lower government spending. </p><p> The World Bank <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-imf-consumption-decrease-576/" target="_blank">warned</a> on April 10 that the loan terms set by the IMF would cut 2014 consumption in Ukraine by 8 percent, as well as erode capital investment. </p><p> The increased cost of household gas and district heating <em>“will affect purchasing power and limit the government’s ability to boost capital spending this year. Thus, in 2014, we expect to see a decline in both consumption and fixed investment,”</em> the World Bank said in a statement. </p><p> </p><p> Earlier in April, Ukraine’s finance minister, Oleksandr Shlapak, said that <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-imf-debt-russia-864/">paying off</a> debt to Russia would not be a top priority for Ukraine when it secured its first tranche of International Monetary (IMF) bailout cash. </p><p> Ukraine’s total debt to Russia, including the $2.2 billion bill for gas, now stands at $16.6 billion, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. </p><p> Back in December, before the Ukrainian protests turned into a nationwide crisis, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian government would essentially <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-15-billion-gas-381/" target="_blank">buy</a> $15 billion in Ukrainian debt by investing in Ukrainian bonds, using money from Russia's National Welfare Fund. The announcement came after a meeting with then-President Viktor Yanukovich in Moscow. </p><p> The deal included a 33 percent discount for natural gas, which could have save the country $7 billion in 2014. The agreement was hailed by then-Prime Minister Azarov as saving Ukraine from economic ruin. </p><p> Protests in Kiev began in November when Ukraine backed out of a trade negotiation deal with the EU in favor of a debt deal with Russia – a move interpreted by Ukrainians as a decisive step away from integration with the EU. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156040-michael-flynn-dia-leaving/</guid><title><![CDATA[US Defense Intelligence Agency director reportedly being forced out]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156040-michael-flynn-dia-leaving/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/80/00/michael-flynn-dia-leaving.jpg" title="Defense Intelligence Agency director U.S. Army Lt.

General Michael Flynn (Reuters / Gary Cameron)" /> <p> United States DIA Director Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn announced to Pentagon staff that he is walking away from that role a year earlier than anticipated. </p><p> The news came via a joint statement made by Flynn and the agency's deputy director, David Shedd, who will also be vacating his post. </p><p> <em>"We are proud of the legacy of sustained superb performance of the thousands of men and women we have served alongside throughout these many years,"</em> they <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_DEFENSE_INTELLIGENCE?SITE=TXMID&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" target="_blank">said</a>. </p><p> According to Washington Post reporters <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/head-of-pentagon-intelligence-agency-forced-out-officials-say/2014/04/30/ec15a366-d09d-11e3-9e25-188ebe1fa93b_story.html" target="_blank">Greg Miller and Adam Goldman</a> the director’s unexpected announcement is the result of increased pressure coming from the likes of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and others who reportedly did not agree with Flynn’s managerial style. </p><p> <em>“His vision in DIA was seen as disruptive; he’s not a guy to take the agency forward in a coordinated and comprehensive manner,”</em> one former Pentagon official told the Post of Flynn, a former colleague. </p><p> Flynn, the source said, wanted to push DIA analysts and operators <em>“up and out of their cubicles into the field to support war fighters or high-intensity operations.”</em> </p><p> Critics of Flynn, the journalists wrote, considered his management style to have <em>“sowed chaos, setting aggressive plans for changes without adequate follow-through”</em> within the agency. </p><p> <em>“I’m not sure DIA sees itself as that,</em>” their source said to the paper. </p><p> According to Miller and Goldman, the decision to take Flynn out of his DIA role comes in the midst of other major changes within both the US intelligence community and military, both of which have been shaken up in recent months after former government contractor Edward Snowden began releasing a trove of sensitive material to the media. </p><p> <em>“I think if I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries,”</em> Flynn said of Snowden during a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/03/07/287037148/transcript-interview-with-lt-gen-michael-flynn" target="_blank">NPR</a> interview that aired last month. </p><p> Previously, Flynn served in the US Army and participated in tours that brought him to Grenada, Haiti, Afghanistan and Iraq. US President Barack Obama picked Flynn to be DIA director two years ago this month, and he was expected to depart from that role in 2015. </p><p> The agency has yet to select who will succeed either Flynn or Shedd, reported the AP. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156032-lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda/</guid><title><![CDATA[US doesn’t care about Ukraine, wants to prove it's still in charge – Lavrov]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156032-lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/00/00/lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda-.jpg" title="Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (Reuters / Suzanne Plunkett)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:38:06 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/18/00/00/lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Washington's approach to the events in Ukraine is not fueled by concerns about the fate of the crisis-torn state, but rather by the desire to prove it is still running the show worldwide, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/00/00/lavrov-us-ukraine-propaganda-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (Reuters / Suzanne Plunkett)" /> <p> The way the situation in Ukraine is reported in mainstream media indicates that “<em>unfortunately, the information machine of our Western colleagues is working at full capacity</em>,” Lavrov said following talks with his Chilean counterpart, Heraldo Munoz, in Santiago. </p><p> The US is trying to shape public opinion in a specific manner “<em>because they are not concerned by the fate of Ukraine in the first place, but have strong desire to prove that it’s them who decides how things should be – always and everywhere,</em>” Lavrov stated. </p><p> The foreign minister stressed that sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and its allies are the result of such a stance, and will have a costly outcome for Washington in the long run. </p><p> However, Moscow currently has no plans to retaliate against the “<em>meaningless</em>” sanctions from the West, he said. </p><p> <em>“At this stage, we want to give our partners a chance to calm down</em>,” Lavrov said. “<em>We’ll see what happens next. If absolutely baseless notations towards Russia will continue, if there are attempts to pressure us with economic leverage, then we may reevaluate the situation.”</em> </p><p> Lavrov has advised the US to “<em>discipline those whom they brought to power in Ukraine</em>” instead of sanctioning Moscow. </p><p> </p><p> He stated that despite declaring themselves “<em>winners of the democratic revolution</em>,” the current government in Kiev is based “<em>on a coalition which includes candid radicals and extremists, condemned even by the EU back in 2012 when the Svoboda party first made it to parliament.”</em> <br></p><p> <br> “<em>But now the Europeans are shyly forgetting about that and cooperate with those same people</em>,” Lavrov added. <br><br> The minister stressed the need to establish a direct dialogue between the coup-imposed Ukrainian authorities and protestors in the nation's southeast in order to solve the crisis in the country. <br><br> “<em>The role of Russia, the US, and Europe, or any other interested state, isn’t about blanching one of sides of the Ukrainian conflict,</em>” he said. </p><p> Lavrov also stated that Moscow has made an attempt to establish a dialogue by proposing a ‘round table’ discussion between Kiev and representatives of the southeastern regions within the framework of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). <br><br> “<em>However, the US and EU representatives have blocked this initiative,”</em> he stressed. “<em>This is sad. We’ll continue to call for the full implementation of the Geneva Declaration, which our partners are trying to distance themselves from.”</em> <br><br> As for the OSCE observers who are still being held by anti-Kiev protesters in the town of Slavyansk, Russia is “urging for them to be released,” Lavrov said. </p><p> </p><p> “<em>But we cannot decide for the self-defense forces</em>,” he added. “<em>Those people live under a constant threat coming from Kiev that the military and armored vehicles will be used against them; under constant threat from the extremists.”</em> <br><br> Southeastern Ukraine has been gripped by ongoing protests, with the majority of its Russian-speaking population refusing to recognize the new authorities in Kiev, who took the reins via a military coup powered by far-right radicals. <br><br> Activists in Donetsk, Lugansk, and other regions have seized government buildings and are demanding a referendum on federalization. <br><br> Despite failing to provide any proof, Washington continues to blame Moscow for masterminding the uprising in Ukraine's southeast. <br><br> The US and its allies have already imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia, targeting individual politicians and businessmen, as well as several companies. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156012-oklahoma-botched-execution-review/</guid><title><![CDATA[Oklahoma governor orders review of botched execution]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156012-oklahoma-botched-execution-review/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/c0/00/oklahoma-botched-execution-review.jpg" title="Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin (Reuters)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:30:35 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/16/c0/00/oklahoma-botched-execution-review.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Oklahoma Gov.

I believe the death penalty is an appropriate response and punishment to those who commit heinous crimes against their fellow men and women,”</em> the Republican governor said at a press conference Tuesday night. <em>“However, I also believe the state needs to be certain of its protocols and its procedures for executions, and that they work.”</em> </p><p> Clayton D. Lockett, 38, was <a href="http://rt.com/usa/155764-controversial-oklahoma-execution-wrong/"> scheduled to be executed</a> at 6pm local time Tuesday with a combination of lethal drugs, details of which were kept secret despite a flurry of court challenges and commentary from Oklahoma lawmakers in the weeks leading up to Lockett’s death. <a href="http://rt.com/usa/oklahoma-lethal-execution-drugs-905/">The state said in advance</a> it would use a combination of the sedative midazolam, the muscle relaxer pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride in the lethal injection procedure. </p><p> But the execution by lethal injection soon went wrong. The execution officially began at 6:23pm, but was cancelled because Lockett was still moving at 6:37 and looked up to say, <em>“Something’s wrong.”</em> </p><p> Department of Corrections officials said at a press conference immediately following the would-be execution that Lockett had blown a vein and that they are not sure where the drugs went in his body, or how much of the injection his body absorbed. Lockett died of a heart attack moments after his convulsion began. </p><p> The independent review will look into Lockett’s cause of death, whether or not the Department of Corrections followed the current protocol for executions and develop recommendations to improve execution protocols for the Department of Corrections, Fallin said at the press conference. Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Thompson will head up the investigation, which will also employ an independent pathologist to determine the cause of death. </p><p> Lockett was convicted of the 1999 kidnapping, rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman, who had been buried alive, MSNBC reports. Charles Warner, who was also scheduled to be executed Tuesday night, was convicted of raping and killing his girlfriend’s 11-month-old daughter in 1997. Fallin granted Warner a stay of execution until at least May 13. </p><p> <em>“I have not given Commissioner Thompson a deadline to complete the review.

If a broadband provider (ISP) acts in a manner that keeps users from effectively taking advantage of that pathway then it should be a violation of the Open Internet rules.”</em> </p><p> On Wednesday, Wheeler told the audience at the annual meeting of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association in Los Angeles that “<em>reports that we are gutting the Open Internet rules are incorrect</em>,” according to <a href="http://time.com/82409/wheeler-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">TIME</a>. </p><p> <em>“If you read some of the press accounts about what we propose to do, those of you who oppose net neutrality might feel like a celebration was in order,”</em> Wheeler said. <em>“Reports that we are gutting the Open Internet rules are incorrect. I am here to say ‘wait a minute.’ Put away the party hats.”</em> </p><p> <em>"Let me be clear. If someone acts to divide the Internet between 'haves' and 'have-nots,' we will use every power at our disposal to stop it,"</em> Wheeler insisted. </p><p> In the midst of a wave of criticism that erupted last week, Wheeler responded at the time that, <em>“To be very direct, the proposal would establish that behavior harmful to consumers or competition by limiting the openness of the Internet will not be permitted.”</em> </p><p> First, however, the five-person FCC board will have to decide if they want to move forward with the guidelines presented to them last week. Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/29/us-usa-internet-fcc-idUSBREA3S18W20140429?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews" target="_blank">reported</a> that the agency will vote on May 15 on Wheeler’s proposed rules. In the meantime, though, the FCC will likely see criticism only continue to mount up: earlier this week, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minnesota) became the latest American lawmaker to oppose Wheeler’s proposal, and wrote in a letter to the chairman that his plan to let companies pay for preferential access to ISPS and ergo internet customers would “<em>destroy</em>” the concept of net neutrality. </p><p> "<em>Your proposal would grant Verizon, Comcast, and other ISPs the power to pick winners and losers on the Internet, which violates core Net neutrality principles that you have publicly supported in the past. Although you claim that this proposal is not a ‘turnaround,’ it is difficult to understand how it does not flatly contradict your own Commission's Open Internet Order</em>,” Franken wrote, according to <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/franken-says-fcc-net-neutrality-would-destroy-open-internet/" target="_blank">CNET</a>. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/156028-russia-sues-eu-energy/</guid><title><![CDATA[Russia sues EU over ‘Third Energy Package’ - report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/156028-russia-sues-eu-energy/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/c0/00/russia-sues-the-eu-over-the-__third-energy-package__.jpg" title="Reuters / Yury Maltsev"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:11:17 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/17/c0/00/russia-sues-the-eu-over-the-__third-energy-package__.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Russia has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the EU's so-called 'Third Energy Package,' according to media reports.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/c0/00/russia-sues-the-eu-over-the-__third-energy-package__.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Yury Maltsev" /> <p> <em>“This procedure is provided for in the rules of the Organization,” a source said, adding that “Russia sent a note to the EU Mission at the WTO and notified the WTO Secretariat thereof,”</em> Itar-Tass news agency reported. </p><p> A second news agency, Interfax, stated that a <em>“source close to WTO”</em> spoke of <em>“the start [of a] court examination.”</em> The agency said it obtained confirmation from the director of the Ministry of Economic Development’s department of trade negotiations, Maksim Medvedkov. </p><p> Signed in 2007, the Third Energy Package outlines a set of rules regulating the European gas and electricity market. The European Commission insists the Third Energy Package was aimed at increasing competition on the energy market, allowing other players to join the sector and liberalizing energy prices. </p><p> One of the core elements prohibits a single company from both owning and operating a gas pipeline and contains rules on third party access to the natural oil transportation grid. </p><p> <em>“These and other elements of the Third Energy Package, in the opinion of Russia, contradict the obligations of the EU in WTO on basic principles of non-discrimination and market access...the Third Energy Package creates serious obstacles to ensure a stable supply of Russian gas to the EU, including a threat to the construction of new transport infrastructure, for example, in the framework of the ‘South Stream,'”</em> Medvedkov told Interfax. </p><p> Moscow broke ground on the South Stream project after securing agreements with intergovernmental agreements with all countries which the pipeline would pass through: Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, and Croatia. </p><p> The Third Energy regulation mandates 50 percent of the pipeline can be operated by Russia's Gazprom, but the other 50 percent must be operated by a third party, a condition Russian energy ministers do not accept, as Gazprom is the only company that has the right to export gas via pipeline. </p><p> Russian President Vladimir Putin previously stated that the "Third Energy Package" and other documents “should not be backdated to the contracts that were signed before the decision on the Third Energy Package came into force.” </p><p> Medvedkov has stressed that Russia has unsuccessfully tried to solve <em>“emerging problems”</em> on a bilateral level. </p><p> Now, under WTO rules, Russia and the EU have 60 days to hold joint consultations. If no solution is found during this time, Moscow can demand the right to initiate the creation of a group of independent arbitrators to look into the case. </p><p> However, Medvedkov has not ruled out the possibility of Russia and the EU reaching an agreement during consultations. </p><p> <em>“We do not aim to have legal proceedings with Brussels for the sake of the judicial process, we want to ensure predictable conditions for export to the EU under WTO rules,”</em> he said. </p><p> The Third Energy Package is a set of regulations for an internal gas and electricity market in the European Union. Its purpose is to further expand the gas and electricity markets in the European Union. The package was proposed by the European Commission in September 2007 and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in July 2009. It entered into force on September 3, 2009. </p><p> In late 2013, Russia filed a lawsuit against the EU over energy adjustments. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/155996-half-americans-polluted-air/</guid><title><![CDATA[Nearly half of Americans live in areas with heavily polluted air]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/155996-half-americans-polluted-air/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/c0/00/air_pollution_levels_are_unhealthy_to_breathe.jpg" title="Smoke is released into the sky at the ConocoPhillips oil refinery in San Pedro, California (Reuters/Bret Hartman )"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 19:24:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/15/c0/00/air_pollution_levels_are_unhealthy_to_breathe.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Up to 150 million people – almost half of all Americans – live in areas where air pollution levels are unhealthy to breathe, the American Lung Association has revealed in its newest report.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/c0/00/air_pollution_levels_are_unhealthy_to_breathe.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Smoke is released into the sky at the ConocoPhillips oil refinery in San Pedro, California (Reuters/Bret Hartman )" /> <p> According to the health organization’s 15th annual 'State of the Air' report, a total of 147.6 million people across the US live in counties with <em>“unhealthful levels of either ozone or particle pollution.”</em> This figure is almost 16 million more than in the 2013 report, in which the organization analyzed pollution levels from 2009, 2010, and 2011. </p><p> State of the Air 2014 focused on the nation’s air quality between 2010 and 2012. </p><p> California towns occupied the top five metropolitan areas with the highest air pollution, with Los Angeles being among the “leaders” in all three categories – by ozone (the most widespread air pollutant), year-round particle pollution, and short-term particle pollution. </p><p> Los Angeles remained the city with the worst ozone pollution problem, and had slightly more days of high ozone levels in 2010-2012. </p><p> These pollutants, the report stresses, remain a <em>“pervasive health threat.”</em> Studies show that particle pollution (a mixture of tiny solids and liquids in the air) and dangerous levels of ozone lead to an increased risk of heart disease, lung cancer, and asthma attacks. </p><p> Though America's overall air quality has improved compared to previous years, levels of ozone (smog) are much worse, the American Lung Association said. </p><p> <em>“Twenty-two of the 25 most ozone-polluted cities in the 2014 report – including Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago – had more high ozone days on average when compared to the 2013 report,”</em> it was revealed in the report. </p><p> Houston, Washington-Baltimore, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Philadelphia are also among those cities with the worst ozone problems. </p><p> The organization links the rise in ozone levels with a changing climate and warmer temperatures during those years. </p><p> <em>“Weather played a factor,"</em> the report said. <em>"The warmer summers in 2010 and 2012 contributed to higher ozone readings and more frequent ozone days. Sunlight and heat create conditions that increase the risk of high ozone levels."</em> </p><p> There are, however, four cities in the US where the air was clean of ozone and short-term particle pollution. They were also on the list of the cleanest cities for year-round particle pollution. According to the report, the cleanest cities are Bangor (ME), Bismarck (ND), Cape Coral-Fort Myers (FL) and Salinas (CA). </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156016-lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail/</guid><title><![CDATA[Huge fire erupts in Virginia following train derailment (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156016-lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/00/00/lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail.jpg" title="Screenshot from youtube.com/channel/UCGuTdI5_Zv0CLDXLJcYrlEw"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 19:18:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/17/00/00/lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A train derailed in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia Wednesday afternoon, causing a major fire to erupt at the scene of the accident.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/17/00/00/lynchburg-virginia-trail-derail.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Screenshot from youtube.com/channel/UCGuTdI5_Zv0CLDXLJcYrlEw" /> <p> Local ABC affiliate WSET News reported that the derailment occurred at around 2 p.m. in the afternoon adjacent to the James River, and eye-witnesses say that before long the area was cloaked in heavy black smoke and flames extending as high as 80-feet into the air. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YA4Mir-Wo9E" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> Lynchburg’s News and Advance paper reported that the train did not contain passenger cars, but was rather a tube car train, potentially carrying chemicals, according to city fire marshal Thomas Goode. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Wow.

Wall Street Journal reporter Kristine Peterson <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/04/30/gop-senators-push-for-tougher-response-to-putin/" target="_blank">added</a> Wednesday morning that the military aspect of the proposal, if approved, would require the White House to substantially increase US and NATO support for the armed forces of allied Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, as well as accelerate implementation of missile defense in Europe. </p><p> On Monday this week, the White House imposed additional sanctions on Russia. Those sanctions targeted seven Russian government officials and 17 companies closely tied with Russia’s Pres. Vladimir Putin. </p><p> <em>“Since April 17, Russia has done nothing to meet its Geneva commitments and in fact has further escalated the crisis,”</em> White House press secretary Jay Carney <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/04/28/statement-press-secretary-ukraine"> said</a> on Monday this week. <em>“Russia’s involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable.”</em> </p><p> <em>“The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally; the goal is to change his calculus, to encourage him to walk the walk, not just talk the talk</em>,” Obama said. </p><p> <em>“I think what is happening now shows us who really was mastering the process from the beginning,”</em> Pres. Putin <a href="http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/">said</a> in response this week<em>. “But in the beginning, the United States preferred to remain in the shadow.”</em> </p><p> The Kremlin fired back at first, and said Russia would not be hurt by the sanctions. Now just days later, conservative members of Congress are saying it’s time for Uncle Sam to up the ante. </p><p> <em>“What we’ve seen from the administration is a lot of rhetoric,”</em> Sen.Bob Corker(R-Tennessee) said Wednesday morning, according to the Journal. </p><p> <em>"Until Putin feels the real pain of sanctions targeting entities like Gazprom, which the Kremlin uses to coerce Ukraine <a href="http://www.reuters.com/places/ukraine?lc=int_mb_1001"></a>and other neighbors, as well as some significant financial institutions, I don't think diplomacy will change Russian behavior and de-escalate this crisis,"</em> he said in a statement. </p><p> Sen. Dan Coats (R-Indiana) added in his own remarks that <em>“The lack of a forceful, effective response by the administration and Western leaders has given Putin little reason to expect that further aggression will be punished."</em> </p><p> <em>“We are introducing tough diplomatic, economic and financial sanctions, and I am hopeful that President Obama will support our effort,”</em> Coats said. </p><p> Washington has blamed Moscow for encouraging a recent uprising in eastern Ukraine and the nearby peninsula of Crimea that has displaced several local governments and imposed pro-Russian officials in their place. The recent Geneva treaty was signed with the goal of relaxing tensions in the region ahead of upcoming elections in Ukraine being held to replace the country’s recently ousted president Viktor Yanukovych, both leaders in both the US and Russia have accused one another of failing to abide by those terms. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156004-georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare/</guid><title><![CDATA[Georgia to demand drug tests for welfare recipients]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156004-georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.jpg" title="Georgia Governor Nathan Deal (Reuters / Tami Chappell)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 18:49:29 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed a bill on Tuesday that requires drug testing for some welfare applicants – and makes them foot the bill as well.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/16/40/00/georgia-demand-drug-test-wellfare-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Georgia Governor Nathan Deal (Reuters / Tami Chappell)" /> <p> According to local NBC affiliate WXIA, the new law will place the fate of a welfare/food stamp applicant in the hands of state employees, who will determine whether or not a drug test is necessary. Generally, this decision would be made by taking into account an individual’s police record, demeanor, reasons for termination from employment, and any missed appointments. </p><p> On Monday, the day before Deal signed the legislation into law, the governor described the challenges facing the proposal that ultimately won his signature. </p><p> <em>"You're trying to balance two competing forces,”</em> he told WXIA. <em>“First is the right of the individual if they qualify to be given assistance in terms of food stamps. On the other hand, the right of the taxpayer not to be putting money in the hands of those abusing drugs. So it's a delicate balance of social issues.”</em> </p><p> The bill has been dubbed <em>“the toughest in the nation when it comes to public assistance”</em> by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, but supporters claim that it ensures anyone receiving taxpayer money is doing so fairly. </p><p> <em>“We passed a bill that simply insists on some level of personal responsibility of people who receive public funds for their support and livelihood,”</em> said state Speaker of the House David Ralston (R). </p><p> Opponents, however, argue that since the state increasingly uses the internet and the phone to manage applications, officials don’t have the kind of in-person interaction necessary to validate claims of reasonable suspicion that require a drug test. </p><p> Additionally, the bill forces applicants to pay for their drug exam – regardless of whether or not they test positive for anything – and places what opponents see as yet another obstacle in the way of the state’s poorest residents. </p><p> <em>"It's a badly flawed bill,"</em> Debbie Seagraves of Georgia’s American Civil Liberties Union said to Reuters. <em>"It will be challenged.”</em> </p><p> <em>"It's one thing for a judge, or district attorney, or police officer to judge what's reasonable suspicion,”</em> added Sen. Vincent Ford (D) to WXIA. <em>“But giving it to an overworked bureaucrat? I think it is bottom line, unfair.”</em> </p><p> As noted by Reuters, other states have tried to implement like-minded bills only to see them fall by the wayside. Last year, a federal judge struck down a similar bill, ruling it violated applicants’ constitutional rights against unreasonable search. Meanwhile, the Republican governor of North Carolina vetoed a drug-testing bill in 2013, arguing it had generated no tangible benefits in other states. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/155984-stop-search-police-uk/</guid><title><![CDATA[UK Home Secretary urges ‘illegal’ stop and search practice overhaul]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/155984-stop-search-police-uk/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.jpg" title="Reuters/Andrew Winning"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 18:15:49 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The UK Home Secretary Theresa May has called for an overhaul of police stop and search powers, telling the House of Commons that as many as 250,000 illegal stop and searches may have been undertaken last year.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/15/00/00/stop-search-police-uk.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters/Andrew Winning" /> <p> May announced plans to change the law, suggesting a review of all stop and search training, and making officers undertake an assessment of their awareness of the practice rules. </p><p> She added that if the number of stop and searches taking place did not drop then she would start making calls for a change to the law. </p><p> <em>“Nobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police,”</em> May told MPs. </p><p> Black people are seven times more likely to be stopped by police than white people. Additionally, only 10 percent of searches actually result in arrest, according to a recent study by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. </p><p> Police are presently allowed to stop somebody only if there are reasonable grounds upon which to suspect that an individual is carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property, or something which could be used to commit a crime, e.g. a crowbar. </p><p> May demanded clarity on what constituted ‘reasonable grounds,’ as well as the opening of records for public scrutiny and <em>“unconscious bias awareness training”</em> to reduce the risk of discrimination. </p><p> As evidence of the necessity for a reform package, May cited the recent study by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. Its conclusions showed that with 27 percent of stop and search records examined, there were no reasonable grounds upon which to search people, despite a supervisor having given the green light for searches to take place. </p><p> <em>”If the HMIC sample is accurate, that means more than a quarter of the million or so stops carried out under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act last year could have been illegal,”</em> stated May. </p><p> The Labour Party said that May’s plans do not go far enough. </p><p> Her opposition counterpart, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper asked her: <em>“Why aren't you banning the use of targets given to police officers to stop and search a certain number of people?”</em> Cooper also questioned why the guidance on race discrimination didn’t have a statutory basis and why there was no insistence that all forces abide by case law instead of just “some.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
