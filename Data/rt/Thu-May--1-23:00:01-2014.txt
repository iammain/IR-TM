The CEO of the company performing the testing is the brother of one of the school’s presidents.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/24/c0/00/drug-test.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Enrique Castro-Mendivil " /> <p> Gilmour Academy, St. Edward High School and St. Ignatius High School announced the new policy to students and their parents on Monday. The schools will use Psychemedics Corporation for the drug tests on hair follicles. Psychemedics’ president and CEO Raymond Kubacki is the brother of St. Edward President James Kubacki. </p><p> K.C. McKenna, vice president of admissions and marketing at St. Edward High School, told <a href="http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2014/04/29/president-of-drug-testing-company-is-brother-of-st-edward-high-school-president"> the Cleveland Scene</a> the decision to work with Psychemedics came after several years of research led by an internal committee made up of members of the board of trustees, a faculty member and members of the administration. <br></p><p> <em>“Certainly, Jim knew a little more about the process because of his brother being involved, but his brother being CEO of that company in no way led to us making the decision to use Psychemedics,"</em> he said. </p><p> <em>“From Day One, I told them this was my brother’s company,”</em> the St. Edward’s president told <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/04/st_eds_president_is_brother_of.html"> the Plain Dealer</a>. But the schools made no mention of any connection between anyone at the schools and Psychemedics in their announcements. </p><p> <em>“The short answer is Gilmour was very much aware of that connection from the beginning and it was never an issue,”</em> Gilmour spokesman Devin Schlickmann told the Plain Dealer. </p><p> <em>“How we picked the company isn’t of interest to high school boys,"</em> St. Ignatius spokeswoman Lisa Metro said. "<em>They’re more interested in how it’s going to play out to them.”</em> Metro also revealed why the committee decided to go with Psychemedics: <em>“They were the only lab with full FDA clearance to do the testing we were looking for,”</em> she said. </p><p> The schools said the drug testing is preventative, and not evidence of substance abuse among students, according to a <a href="http://www.sehs.net/general/custom.asp?page=wellness">statement on the St. Edward website</a>. <em>“The schools decided to initiate drug testing out of a deep concern for the health and well-being of students,”</em> the statement says. <em>“The primary purpose for this initiative is to give students another reason to say “no” to the pressures of using illegal drugs and to help them remain substance-free. This initiative is simply one more component in our student wellness efforts.”</em> </p><p> However, school leaders told The Plain Dealer the heroin epidemic in Northeast Ohio was the <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/04/mandatory_drug_testing_to_analyze_students_hair_3_area_catholic_high_schools_to_start_practice_this_fall.html#incart_m-rpt-1"> catalyst for implementing the program</a>. </p><p> The statement did outline the decision to use hair testing over body fluids like urine or saliva. “Many drugs are undetectable in urine as early as 72 hours after use, whereas they can be detected in hair samples for several months after ingestion,” the statement says. “In addition, it is much more difficult to adulterate or substitute hair samples and collection is much less intrusive, as well as more cost-effective.” </p><p> Hair-testing kits cost $39 to $50 each, schools that currently work with Psychemedics told the Scene. All high school students - about 980 at St. Ed’s, 340 at Gilmour and 1,500 at St. Ignatius - will be subject to testing at the beginning of the 2014-2015 school year, and then random testing will occur throughout the year. The three contracts combined will pay Psychemedics nearly $120,000 for the initial testing alone, the Plain Dealer reports. </p><p> According to the St. Ed’s statement, hair testing can detect drug use for up to three months. The timing of the announcement gives students a four-month warning before testing begins. <em>“The only good thing about this is that they announced it this early,”</em> one Ignatius student wrote on the Scene site<em>. “They practically winked at us while saying that the test can detect drugs used up to 3 months prior to it, and the first tests won't begin for 4 months.”</em> </p><p> The student also noted, <em>“We were also told that shaved heads would not work as the test can be done with even arm hair… And as a side note, the students will likely just be drinking a lot more.”</em> </p><p> Reactions to the new policy have been mixed. </p><p> <em>"As long as you're not doing drugs, it's not an issue,"</em> St. Edward senior Gavin Bridegum said to WKYC. <em>"It's like one piece of hair, it's not that invasive or anything. It's not a blood test."</em> </p><p> <em>“My sons attend SIHS and I don't see this as anything but a positive measure. I am grateful the administration cares enough to be this intrusive. I work in an ER and have seen all too often the result of teenage drug abuse. It's not pretty,”</em> one St. Ignatius parent wrote on the Scene website. <em>“If we can save families the tragedy of this epidemic, I'm all for it. Just because there is money to be made does not in any way indicate that was a motivating factor. This is just another example of the public/media trying to create unnecessary controversy over something.”</em> </p><p> <em>"In terms of a privacy issue, I think it might be a little bit too much,"</em> parent Diane Erny told WKYC. <em>"Where it's coming from and why?"</em> </p><p> The parent of a child who will enroll at St. Ed's in the fall told the Plain Dealer he supports the decision to conduct drug testing, but wonders about the timing of the announcement. Other families who are against it, but who already have committed to sending their sons to the school, are now in a bind, he said. </p><p> Students will not face punishment for a positive drug test, but will receive counseling and other assistance, the St. Ed’s statement said. <em>“Ultimately, this is not designed to be a punitive program; it’s designed as a prevention and intervention strategy. By identifying students at risk, we can work with their parents and health professionals to get them the help they need and re-direct their path.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156240-spacex-musk-injunction-russia-rockets/</guid><title><![CDATA[Elon Musk halts deal between US Air Force and Russian rocket-makers]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156240-spacex-musk-injunction-russia-rockets/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/25/00/00/elon-musk.jpg" title="CEO and chief designer of SpaceX Elon Musk (Alex Wong / Getty Images / AFP)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 20:23:56 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/25/00/00/elon-musk.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​A decision handed out late Wednesday by a United States Court of Federal Claims judge will for now keep the American aerospace industry from buying Russian-made rockets.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/25/00/00/elon-musk.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="CEO and chief designer of SpaceX Elon Musk (Alex Wong / Getty Images / AFP)" /> <p> Judge Susan G. Branden issued an injunction this week just days after California’s SpaceX company asked the US government to reconsider a deal between the Air Force and United Launch Services — a joint-venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing — that’s expected to involve space-related contracts with Russian rocket maker NPO Energomash. </p><p> SpaceX founder Elon Musk asked the feds to intervene because not only was he opposed to the Air Force awarding a non-competitive contract to the ULA without seeking other bids, but also because he thought other American companies should be considered in the midst of an international crisis that has caused tensions between Washington and Moscow to worsen in recent weeks due to the ongoing unrest in Ukraine. </p><p> The Lockheed-Boeing alliance, Musk said, relies on Russian-made engines for its Atlas V rockets. </p><p> <em>"The long-term contract, which guarantees the purchase of 36 rocket cores from ULA to be used in national security launches, was granted to ULA on a sole-source basis without any competition from other launch providers,"</em> SpaceX said in a statement last week. </p><p> <em>“This is not SpaceX protesting and saying these launches should be awarded to us,”</em> Musk added. “<em>We’re just saying these launches should be competed. If we compete and lose, that’s fine. But why would they not even compete it? That doesn’t make sense.”</em> </p><p> On Wednesday evening, Judge Branden agreed, ruling that, <em>"in the court’s judgment,the public interest and national defense and security concerns that underlie Executive Order 13,661 warrant issuance of a preliminary injunction in this case,”</em> thus prohibiting both the US Air Force and ULA <em>“from making any purchase from or payment of money to NPO Energomash.”</em> <br><br> Judge Branden’s decision also prohibits the Air Force and ULA from doing business with any entity, whether governmental, corporate or individuals, that is controlled by Russia’s deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin — just one of the latest foreign officials sanctioned by Washington as a result of Moscow’s perceived role in the unrest that continues to plague eastern Ukraine. </p><p> After being hit with sanctions, Rogozin announced over Twitter on Thursday that he had a new plan that could help get the US into space without relying on Russian companies any longer. </p><p> <em>"After analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest the US delivers its astronauts to the ISS [international space station] with a trampoline.”</em> Rogozin wrote. </p><p> NBC News reported this week that Judge Branden’s Wednesday night decision will keep the Air Force and ULA from purchasing any Russian-made engines unless and until either the Department of Treasury or Commerce say such contractors wouldn’t go against US sanctions. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156252-germany-snowden-testify-nsa/</guid><title><![CDATA[Germany drops Snowden’s invite to testify on NSA spying in person]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156252-germany-snowden-testify-nsa/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/25/c0/00/snowden.jpg" title="Reuters / Vincent Kessler "/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 20:15:17 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/25/c0/00/snowden.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Germany will not be inviting whistleblower Edward Snowden to testify in front of a parliamentary committee which investigates US spying tactics of EU leaders and nationals, a German MP said on Thursday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/25/c0/00/snowden.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Vincent Kessler " /> <p> A member of the investigative committee from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) said in a statement that the government opposes Snowden testifying in the case regarding the National Security Agency (NSA)'s activities in Germany. </p><p> <em>"The federal government has never been in any doubt that there is no legal basis for Mr. Snowden to travel to Germany,"</em> Roderich Kiesewetter of the CDU said in a statement, as quoted by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p> His statement came in response to a media report that accused the government of blocking Snowden’s visit to Germany because of diplomatic reasons. </p><p> The report published earlier on Thursday by Süddeutsche Zeitung said that a personal invitation to the former NSA contractor and leaker would <em>"run counter to the political interests of the Federal Republic"</em> and "<em>put a grave and permanent strain"</em> on US-German relations. </p><p> German opposition members from the Left and Green party who are involved in the investigation believe that Snowden is a key witness and should testify in person. But the CDU believes a written questionnaire would suffice. </p><p> The whistleblower is currenty in Russia under temporary asylum. He asked for asylum in Germany last summer, but his application was rejected because he didn't file it from German soil. If Snowden would have been invited to testify, he could have met the requirements. </p><p> Meanwhile, opposition members have slammed Merkel for being cowardly towards the US. </p><p> <em>"Merkel is displaying cowardice towards our ally America,"</em> said Green party leader Simone Peter, as quoted by the Guardian. <em>"We owe the Americans nothing in this respect. The government must at least make a serious effort to safely bring Snowden to Germany and let him give evidence here. But Merkel doesn't want that."</em> </p><p> Merkel’s office said on Tuesday that the chancellor will raise the NSA surveillance issue during her upcoming visit to the US. She will meet with President Barack Obama on Friday. </p><p> Clemense Binninger, chair of the investigative committee, believes that getting at least some response from the Americans would be <em>“an important step forward to restoring trust,”</em> Deutsche Welle reported in April. </p><p> Snowden's revelations regarding US spying on Germany continue to pour in. Der Spiegel recently published additional leaked data, including information that the NSA compiled a comprehensive dossier on Merkel, which included over 300 intelligence reports. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156244-student-footage-korean-ferry/</guid><title><![CDATA[Newly released footage details students' last moments aboard sinking S.

(AFP Photo / Ed Jones)" /> <p> <strong>[WARNING: You might find the footage or the description of events below disturbing]</strong> </p><p> The video was found on a phone belonging to one of the students, 17-year old Park Su-hyeon. The video was released to South Korean television by Park’s father after the teenager’s body was recovered from the vessel by South Korean coast guard rescuers. </p><p> All the faces of the passengers have been blocked out as many of their bodies have not yet been recovered. </p><p> In the clip it is 8:52 am, April 16, and the ferry is getting increasingly unstable. Only one of the teenagers can be seen wearing a life jacket. By the end of the footage the ship’s tilting gets worse and everyone appears to be wearing one. </p><p> The students are visibly startled by the events, but try to hide the unease joking about <em>“defying gravity”</em> and trying to walk on the walls as the ship lists. <em>“This is like Titanic,”</em> says one, while another replies <em>“this is fun”.</em> </p><p> Several times the students are warmed over the loudspeaker to stay where they are. Meanwhile, the listing of the ship makes it more and more difficult to get out. </p><p> One of the boys says <em>“I want to get off. We don’t want to die.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> As their situation gets increasingly perilous, some of them realize they must try and leave the ship before it’s too late. </p><p> <em>“I’m getting out of here”</em>, says one of them. <em>“Me too, me too”</em> says another. <em>“We have to survive now,”</em> says someone else. </p><p> As the crew hand out more and more life jackets, one of the student’s says: <em>“I don’t know what’s going on. If they are telling us to wear life jackets, doesn’t it mean that it is sinking?”</em> </p><p> One of the students then leaves a message for his mum, saying <em>“Mom, I love you.”</em> Another says, <em>“We’re all finished. I have to leave some farewell words before I die.”</em> </p><p> More than two weeks into the disaster, over 210 people have been confirmed dead and a further 89 are still unaccounted for. Some bodies have been recovered from as much as two kilometers from the wreckage of the ship due to the strong ocean currents leading to concerns that some bodies might never be found. </p><p> The release of the video comes after news that 14 members of the crew have been arrested and that the owner of the ferry ignored warnings from an off duty captain that the ship’s stability had been compromised by a refurbishment which made it too heavy. </p><p> The captain also warned that the ship should not carry too much cargo after the refurbishment. The Sewol was proved to have been carrying three times over its recommended cargo weight. </p><div class="full_transcript"> <a href="">Read the full transcript</a> </div><div class="full_transcript_text"> <p> <strong>Full script of recorded conversations</strong> </p> <p> Audio on ferry's speaker says "Don't move away from your places and brace for any possible accidents." </p> <p> A student says "Am I really going to die?" </p> <p> A curtain showing "It is not time to laugh.

A simple, old-fashioned letterhead with a suitable blunt message is all it takes. But is it foolproof?]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/24/80/00/picture.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Justin Sullivan / Getty Images / AFP " /> <p> It isn’t secret, but it is a weapon of stealth. It doesn’t arrive by drone; rather it drops in through the regular mail. The “scarlet letter” was devised under Section 311 of the US Patriot Act in the wake of 9/11. The aim is simple – it is a way of ensuring that your friend is actually your friend, and a means to convince your foe's service providers to rethink their affiliations, too. </p><p> Clearly if you have a branch in the USA, the last thing you want is a horde of federal agents roaming across your brand, looking for evidence of suspicious financial activity throughout the open office cubicles, or, worse still, the C-suite offices. Thus America has a simple tool, a piece of correspondence which looks akin to a standard bulk mailshot from the 1980's but is much, much more likely to elicit a response from the recipient than an offer to subscribe to Reader’s Digest. Essentially those who provide business services, as well as banks and insurers, are a perfect target. Service providers can be accused of money laundering, or the difficult to define concept of underwriting terrorist offenses and thus be inflicted with a toxic stain of reputational damage, not to mention a lengthy court process and likely restitution. </p><p> Such processes recently captured the Clearstream business of Germany’s stock exchange. Clearstream had not broken European sanctions to Iran but by dint of having an office in the US, federal officials extracted a $152 million fine. Criminal investigations are ongoing. </p><p> When faced with large fines and, worse still, a spell in an orange jumpsuit, even the most focussed of client organizations are keen to mouth the mantra that “central government (not the client) is always right.” </p><p> Thus in the short term, the scarlet letter process could wreak havoc by targeting those who deal with Russia. Then again, previous successes have all been relatively minor affairs. China capitulated to scarlet letters in 2005, but that concerned a tiny bank in Macau – hardly an institution which was at the epicenter of Chinese finance, dealing with North Korea. In a world where Visa and MasterCard barely disappeared for hours before the systems were switched on again in Moscow, can the US realistically wield such exhaustive power against Russia? </p><p> Initially, scarlet letters clearly scare off anybody with offices in the USA and perhaps those who don’t concentrate on US dealings but are worried about Western brand damage. However, given that Russia remains a lucrative source of high yield debt, is it impossible to conceive that no other nations will want to have some investment interaction? After all, current refunding worries in Russia can only lead to a desire to borrow money at higher rates and those higher rates will benefit savers...will bond buying be bolstered by Russian citizens, perhaps? Or will it fall to traditionally non-aligned states or those less sympathetic to the US, to channel funds towards the rich opportunity of Russian debt and equity markets? </p><p> Scarlet letters have a remarkable deterrent value for the home US constituency and may even prove a better way to whip the EU into America’s desire for harsher sanctions than simply choosing names from the Kremlin area telephone directory, as appears to be the current vogue. In the modern world, payment systems are diverging from Anglo-American analogue era legacy systems to state of the art decentralized digital blockchains competing in cyberspace…Who can tell who is providing investment funds, if, for instance Russia just opts to ignore the old Western money markets and seeks debt issues in anonymized bitcoin instead? </p><p> Scarlet letters are clearly a powerful deterrent but they are not a panacea. In the brave new world of digital technology, pieces of paper have some remarkable legacy uses but they are unlikely to be able to outperform the power of a vast multinational network. In the single superpower model, America had a huge advantage with the Scarlet letter. In a world where many increasingly question the competence of Messrs Obama, Biden, and Kerry et al to manage US affairs coherently, it is not unreasonable to assume a widespread letter writing campaign may initially draw blood but soon the natural impact of higher returns will attract cash from within Russia, or the Middle East, or perhaps elsewhere amongst the BRICS…Markets abhor a vacuum. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156220-darth-vader-ukraine-mayor/</guid><title><![CDATA[Dark side of Ukraine’s election: Darth Vader runs for mayor in Kiev, Odessa]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156220-darth-vader-ukraine-mayor/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/c0/00/darth-vader-main.jpg" title="&quot;Darth Vader&quot;, first deputy head of the Internet Party of Ukraine (Reuters / Shamil Zhumatov)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 19:16:08 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/23/c0/00/darth-vader-main.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Sith Lord Darth Vader, whose Ukraine presidency bid was earlier rejected, has been registered as a candidate for mayoral elections in the capital Kiev and the port city of Odessa, with a plan to run for the top seat in “all key cities” in the country.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/c0/00/darth-vader-main.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt=""Darth Vader", first deputy head of the Internet Party of Ukraine (Reuters / Shamil Zhumatov)" /> <p> The Odessa election commission voted Thursday to register 'Darth Nikolayevich Vader' for the mayoral election on May 25, the same day that Ukraine is due to elect a new president. </p><p> The Star Wars villain will fight for the post with 18 other contenders – primarily earthly Ukrainian politicians and businessmen. </p><p> “<em>The registration is completed. The first step towards the victory is made. Power is itself coming into my hands and I’m not ready to resist,</em>” said Vader, according to the website for the Internet party of Ukraine, which nominated him as a candidate. </p><p> </p><p> The former Jedi Knight and deputy leader of the party has also registered to take part in the Kiev mayoral vote. Vader has twice won the party's primaries, the group said. </p><p> Apparently, an unsuccessful attempt to join Ukraine’s presidential race has not discouraged Lord Vader. Earlier this year, he <a href="http://rt.com/news/vader-presidential-hopeful-ukraine-885/" target="_blank">submitted documents</a> to the Central Election Commission, but was refused registration, while two courts in Kiev threw out his suits against the decision. </p><p> “<em>They stole my victory at the presidential elections, but failed to steal my will for the victory. I assure all my supporters – my decisiveness has never been stronger than it is now,</em>” Vader said. “<em>That’s why I made a decision to run for mayor, mayors of all key cities in Ukraine. Soon I will be in your city, too</em>.” </p><p> </p><p> Vader’s “cabinet maker” is already working on a proper imperial seat, or rather a throne, that Lord Vader is planning to place in his office if he wins. </p><p> Vader is not a newbie to Ukrainian politics. During the 2012 parliamentary election, he scored three percent of votes, according to his party. Unfortunately, the votes were never registered because supporters each had to add Vader’s name to the ballots, which rendered them void under Ukrainian law. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156228-stress-contagious-say-scientists/</guid><title><![CDATA[Is stress contagious?

The research notes that in a society where stress is everywhere, emphatic stress is a phenomenon that cannot be ignored. </p><p> Stress can affect a general environment in a psychologically quantifiable way through increased concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol. </p><p> <em>“The fact that we could actually measure this empathic stress in the form of a significant hormone release was astonishing,”</em> said Veronika Engert, one of the main authors of the study. <em>“There must be a transmission mechanism via which the target’s state can elicit a similar state in the observer down to the level of a hormonal stress response.”</em> </p><p> During the test, subjects were asked to complete difficult mental arithmetic tasks and interviews while two behavioral analysts watched their performance. Only five percent of the directly stressed subjects were able to stay calm. </p><p> Twenty-six percent of observers – who were not directly exposed to the stress – also showed a significant increase in cortisol. </p><p> While observers watched stressful events through the one-way mirror, 30 percent of them experienced a stress response. Even when watching virtually, through a video link, cortisol levels rose in 24 percent of observers. </p><p> <em>“A hormonal stress response has an evolutionary purpose, of course. When you are exposed to danger, you want your body to respond with an increase in cortisol. However, permanently elevated cortisol levels are not good,”</em> explained Engert. </p><p> Anyone who is confronted with the sustained suffering and stress of another person is likely to have a higher risk of being affected themselves. </p><p> The research also dispelled a common myth that women are more empathic than men, finding that men and women experience emphatic stress with equal frequency. The study found that empathic stress arose the most when the observer and the stressed individual were in a couple relationship. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/156224-obama-visit-asia-china/</guid><title><![CDATA[US oblivion: Obama's weird tour of Asia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/156224-obama-visit-asia-china/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/24/00/00/obama-japan.jpg" title="US President Barack Obama (L) attends a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (R) at the Akasaka guesthouse in Tokyo on April 24, 2014.

(AFP Photo / Pool / Junko Kimura-Matsumoto)" /> <p> There were speeches clearly aimed at swelling anti-Chinese and anti-North Korean sentiments, and there were promises to ‘defend’ certain countries, including South Korea and Japan, although both of them appear to be more belligerent than their communist alleged adversaries. </p><p> There was immediate reaction from Pyongyang, calling South Korean President Park Geun-Hye a “prostitute,” and there was an ice-cold reaction from Beijing, calling on the US and Japan to “abandon their cold war mentality.” </p><p> The US language was, as always, patronizing, even insulting – as in The New York Times’ report: </p><p> <em>“Jeffrey A. Bader, who was the senior China adviser on the National Security Council until 2011, said: 'The message is: Don’t think that what Putin is doing in eastern Ukraine is so brilliant that you should be inspired by it. Don’t think that this is a model that could work for you.'”</em> </p><p> This kind of unsavory preaching is naturally despised in China and in many other countries. </p><p> But Obama’s visit was disastrous on many other fronts, too. There were trade deals proposed that never fully materialized, including those between the United States and Japan. There were bilateral trade agreements signed between the US and Malaysia, but the 12-country Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which commits countries to lower import tariffs and therefore horrifies local producers, never really materialized. </p><p> </p><p> What actually occurred was the signing of what Reutersdescribed as “<em>a 10-year military pact with the Philippines that opens the way for US troops, planes and warships to have greater access to bases in the Philippines</em>.” </p><p> Officially, it was to ‘protect’ the Philippines from the rising ‘threat’ of China. Although many of the intellectuals in Manila see the United States as pitching southeast nations against its great neighbor. </p><p> Eduardo C. Tadem, a leading Philippine academic and professor of Asian studies at the University of the Philippines, commented for this report: </p><p> <em>"The Obama administration has not departed substantially from the policies of its predecessors as far as foreign policy is concerned. Given this, it does not possess the moral authority to lecture China on the proper behavior of a big power in the Asia-Pacific region. Granted that China has not been on its best behavior with respect to the territorial disputes it is embroiled with in the region, it is the US, on the whole, that has done much more damage against Asian peoples and societies with its imperial policies in both the economic and political spheres. Neither does it have the moral authority to lead Asian societies in charting a new economic order given its own failed economy with high unemployment and continually rising inequalities."</em> </p><p> Malaysia became a brand new addition to the list of US ‘allies’ in the region, although, to what extent, still remains to be seen. </p><p> </p><p> As I landed at the habitually super-efficient Kuala Lumpur International Airport on April 26, long lines formed queues before the immigration counters, and arriving passengers were fingerprinted – something that is very rarely done in Malaysia. </p><p> The rail network had collapsed, express trains were running on local tracks, and I was told that many of the roads in the capital had been blocked. </p><p> Overall, in Malaysia, the entire ‘presidential charade’ was thoroughly embarrassing, even from the point of view of the former ruler of the country, and one of the most outspoken critics of the West on the Asian continent, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. The former prime minister particularly distrusted the proposed TPP or TPPA. Malaysian filmmaker and TV producer Azreen Madzlan shared her experience with me: </p><p> <em>“According to former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad during an interview with a local business channel Capital TV, for the show that I was producing, Malaysia should not be compelled to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) just because of President Obama’s visit to Malaysia this weekend. Tun M who has openly roasted Najib’s administration for its intention to sign on with the non-transparent deal continues to warn that TPPA is a controlled trade agreement put together by an impoverished nation trying to exploit the natural resources of other countries.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> But the Malaysian media had chosen to welcome the supreme leader of the Western world with loud fanfares, even using the most poetic words. </p><p> Huge headlines shouted from the top of most of the local dailies: 'Hello Malaysia,' the self-proclaimed 'people's paper,' the Sunday Star, wrote as it depicted the grinning face of Barack Obama. The paper then commented: <em>“F</em><em>lashing his infectious smile, President Barack Obama stepped out of Air Force One, gave his customary right handed “hello” wave – and charmed every one of the dignitaries who met him as he arrived for his official visit to the country. It will be a busy day for him before he leaves for Manila tomorrow.”</em> </p><p> Western media opted for a wide range of attitudes, from hardcore propaganda to the phlegmatic style adopted by The New York Times: </p><p> <em>“On Sunday, President Obama visited Malaysia to underscore how much has changed in the past 16 years – not least in the country’s attitude toward the United States, which has evolved from deep suspicion, verging on contempt, to a cautious desire for cooperation.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Legendary Malaysian political activist Hishamuddin Rais (he identifies himself as a ‘non-government individual’) wrote for this report: </p><p> <em>“Obama is trying to recreate the atmosphere of the Cold War in Asia in particular and globally...Obama’s trip to Malaysia in particular is aimed at the Malaysian leadership to open up and allow access to the Malaysian market. At the same time America is keen to have a military arrangement with Malaysia, i.e. the possibility of having a base. This is a move partly to control the Southeast Asian market and also to contain what Americans term as the danger of China. Obama is trying to create a wedge between ASEAN nations and China. In Malaysia in particular, with the weak government of Najib Razak, Obama will force Najib to sign the TPPA trade agreement. It is a fact that TPPA will be destructive to the domestic market.”</em> </p><p> There was plenty of cliché propaganda talk from US officials about ‘defending democracy,' about freedom and trade, and about all those ‘terrible countries’ that the ‘benevolent and wise West’ has to ‘deal with.' </p><p> The increasingly aggressive role of the United States and the 'Western world’ has not been discussed in the suddenly over-polite local media outlets. It should have been. Because between the lines, it was clear that the goal of Obama’s journey was to flex muscles, and to show Asia who is still in charge here. </p><p> And of course, to re-pledge support for the most obedient ones, like Japan and the Philippines, over their policy towards China, or in the case of Japan, its open hostility towards the great neighbor. </p><p> It is essential that the Asian countries that are now willing to collaborate with the West are actually becoming co-responsible for what can be best described as the imperialist, neo-colonialist, even fascist, adventurism of North America and Europe. </p><p> </p><p> In the future, history may judge them very harshly! </p><p> The West, including the United States, has embarked on all sorts of genocidal projects all over the Asia Pacific region for centuries. It has terrorized this part of the world with tremendous force and determination, from Vladivostok to East Timor. </p><p> Be it not for the servility of Asian leaders, and for the total manipulation of history, Air Force One would have been met with jet fighters and interceptors – not with flowers and national anthems. </p><p> The problem is that in the Asia Pacific region, in many parts of it at least, the countries are governed by thoroughly shameless ‘elites’ (read thugs, bandits), and these individuals are united with Western economic and political ‘leaders' in their determination to plunder and mug everything that grows, hides below the surface, and even walks and talks. </p><p> This is especially true about the places like the Philippines and Indonesia, but also about Thailand, Cambodia, and even, to a lesser extent, South Korea. </p><p> Japan is an exception, as it has willingly and shamelessly been exchanging its independence for a rich and comfortable quality of life, willingly accepting the role of an obedient, sclerotic, and depressed (but extremely well paid) servant of the West, on the Asian continent. </p><p> David McNeill, a leading expert on Japan and a Professor at Sophia University, recently explained during our conversation and the filming of my Okinawa documentary, in Tokyo: </p><p> <em>“Japan, after the Second World War, aligned itself very quickly with America… And Japan’s military alliance with America is also accompanied with, what critics would say, its subservient attitude towards Washington.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Let’s just revisit a few of the most horrifying atrocities the West performed in the Asia Pacific region, in the last hundred years or so. </p><p> Both British and US forces occupied, brutally, the city of Vladivostok in Russia's Far East after the Bolshevik Revolution. </p><p> China was plundered and colonized by European forces, brutally and relentlessly. </p><p> Korea was terrorized by mainly North American troops, with the most horrific toll on the local, mainly civilian population, with an estimated death toll of over four million people. </p><p> During WWII, Japan endured firebombing and the carpet-bombing of its cities, including Tokyo, as well as basically, two nuclear experiments against its population in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. </p><p> The French barbarically tortured, raped, and mutilated the people of Vietnam, but also those of Laos and Cambodia. The savagery exceeded even that of the later US ‘involvement,' as many local people, whilst I lived in Hanoi for three years, explained to me. </p><p> In 'Indochina,' the US, of course, bombed to ashes entire cities, poisoned the countryside, raped the female population of entire villages, and committed atrocities comparable only to those they themselves had earlier committed in Korea. Historians are still arguing about the death toll: Was it six million or ten million, during what they called the ‘Vietnam War’ and the ‘Secret War in Laos?' (In that part of the world, that genocide is squarely identified as the ‘American War’). </p><p> The US also made sure to open the doors to the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia (by carpet-bombing most of the Cambodian countryside into the stone ages), later vocally demanding their return to power, from the floor of the United Nations and other organizations. All that, of course, happened after Vietnamese troops had kicked out Pol Pot’s boys and girls from power (the US considered it a great crime). </p><p> Kissinger had it very clear: He suggested that “<em>anything that flies should be used against anything that moves</em>,” and he had it his way. And he never faced a firing squad for this, although his tactics were not too different from those employed by the German Nazis. </p><p> In the Philippines, the US committed much greater atrocities than Japan (including the Balanginga massacre), but a brainwashing campaign, and the servility of most of the local media, made it impossible to discuss these topics openly. </p><p> The Philippines were brutally colonized by both Spain and the United States, but the US propagandists have managed to re-narrate the entire history of the archipelago. </p><p> British rule in what is now Malaysia and Singapore was very far from benevolent. </p><p> </p><p> The Thai Western ally murdered its communists, as well as student protesters, and placed its territory at the disposal of the West during the Vietnam War. </p><p> Indonesia was repeatedly attacked by the United States from its bases in the Philippines, during the reign of the progressive and anti-Western President Sukarno. </p><p> The US-sponsored military coup brought the military junta to power, and some two to three million Indonesians were murdered – mainly communists, Chinese citizens, and intellectuals. Fascist Indonesia then occupied (with the support of the West) tiny East Timor, where some 30 percent of the population lost their lives in a horrific genocide. Western media hushes up coverage of the ongoing genocide against the Papuan population, as it greatly benefits the interests of Western mining companies. </p><p> Still, collaboration with the US appears to be an attractive option to many governments in the region. </p><p> China is watching, and, not surprisingly, it appears that it does not like what it sees at all. Russia, another great ‘Asian’ power is even more outraged. North Korea is, as always, ‘ready.' </p><p> Mr. Obama may count on the weak and submissive allies, but Asia is changing. It is evolving. It is watching. It may soon begin saying “No.” </p><p> Mr. Obama decided to visit South Korea but not China. </p><p> Does it matter? Maybe...but for how long? </p><p> "<em>If you come or do not come, we will be here</em>," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang. </p><p> <strong><em>Andre Vltchek</em></strong> <em>is a novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist.

Reid (D-Nevada) during a recent address at the ranch, where supporters remain on site after federal officials attempted last month to confiscate the cattle of Bundy — a 67-year-old rancher who has more than two decades has refused to pay the government fees for grazing on land that the feds say is US property. </p><p> Vanderboegh of Alabama and others have stood guard at the Bundy ranch in the days since the US Bureau of Land Management began and then aborted their attempt to confiscate cattle, but nevertheless continue to generate controversy. </p><p> Reid last week called Bundy a “<em>hateful racist</em>” who “<em>mooched</em>” off the government after the rancher was caught making remarks to the New York Times considered to be pro-slavery. </p><p> <em>“Cliven Bundy has spent decades profiting off government land while refusing to pay the same fair use fees as his fellow ranchers,”</em> Reid said last Thursday, adding that <em>“by denigrating people who work hard and play by the rules while he mooches off public land, he also revealed himself to be a hypocrite.”</em> </p><p> Now in the newly surfaced video, Vanderboegh says Reid <em>“is promising us all civil war on a vast scale, because state-sponsored violence is the only way they can win an argument with free people, especially free people who are armed and who are willing to use those arms in defense of liberty.”</em> </p><p> <em>“All over this country, we are still staring civil war in its bloody face,”</em> Vanderboegh is caught saying on camera. </p><p> <em>“Don’t poke the wolverine with a sharp stick, Harry,”</em> Vanderboegh added. <em>“Unless you want your balls ripped off.”</em> </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2uEXkmMealE?feature=player_embedded" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> The latest tirade is likely to not help Bundy supports, however: earlier this week, POLITICO <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/cliven-bundy-harry-reid-threat-106106.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that federal officials are investigating alleged threat made at Reid in the days since he spoke out against the rancher. </p><p> <em>“We are currently looking into threatening statements made against Sen. Reid as part of an ongoing investigation,”</em> Shennell Antrobus, a spokesman for the US Capitol Police, told the DC-based newspaper on Monday. </p><p> One day earlier, a US congressman who represents a region of Nevada just outside of Bundy’s ranch, said he was concerned about the armed militia groups that have descended there in recent weeks. </p><p> <em>“We must respect individual constitutional liberties, but the residents of and visitors to Clark County should not be expected to live under the persistent watch of an armed militia,”</em> Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nevada) wrote in a letter to Clark County Sheriff Douglas Gillespi on Sunday. </p><p> On his part, Reid said previously that Bundy’s supporters are “domestic terrorists.” </p><p> The latest outburst from Vanderboegh isn’t the first to make national headlines, however. Back in 2010, the Three Percenters leader urged militiamen to throw bricks through the windows of Democratic lawmakers from coast-to-coast. </p><p> <em>"So, if you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party [that they] cannot fail to hear, break their windows,"</em> Vanderboegh wrote on his Sipsey Street Irregulars blog, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/25/AR2010032501722.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> reported at the time. "<em>Break them NOW. Break them and run to break again. Break them under cover of night. Break them in broad daylight. Break them and await arrest in willful, principled civil disobedience. Break them with rocks. Break them with slingshots. Break them with baseball bats. But BREAK THEM."</em> </p><p> On the Sipsey Street Irregulars page, the Three Percenters group claim to be <em>“the people that the collectivists who now control the government should leave alone if they wish to continue unfettered oxygen consumption.</em>” Their name refers to the percentage of colonial Americans who are alleged to have fought against the British during the Revolutionary War. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156208-missing-plane-malaysia-report/</guid><title><![CDATA[Four hours of confusion: Malaysia releases MH370 report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156208-missing-plane-malaysia-report/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/00/00/malasia-plane.jpg" title="A graphic of the area being searched for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 (AFP Photo/ Pool / Greg Wood)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 18:02:13 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/23/00/00/malasia-plane.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A preliminary report released by Malaysia’s Transport Ministry reveals that officials didn’t notice for 17 minutes that the missing flight had gone off radar and didn’t activate an official rescue operation until four hours after the disappearance.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/00/00/malasia-plane.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A graphic of the area being searched for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 (AFP Photo/ Pool / Greg Wood)" /> <p> The five-page report notes that the plane disappeared from radar in Kuala Lumpur at 01:21 local time on March 8. As the plane’s crew should have contacted Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, Vietnamese air traffic controllers waited 17 minutes before asking Malaysian air traffic control where the plane was. After this, there was a four-hour gap before an official rescue operation was launched. </p><p> On Tuesday, a Malaysian official said the aircraft could have flown on for another seven-and-a-half hours, meaning that the plane may have been airborne in the four-hour gap, and for two-and-a-half hours after the fruitless search began. </p><p> There is also confusion surrounding the role of Malaysia’s military on the night of the disappearance. Malaysia's prime minister has said that the military tracked a plane on its radar that may have been flight MH370 as it made a westerly turn and headed back across the Malaysian peninsular. But the report makes no mention of the military at all. </p><p> Compared to other reports on recent major flight investigations, this one is scant at best. In contrast, the preliminary report into Air France 447 was released one month after the plane disappeared but was 128 pages long. And a preliminary report into the Quantas engine explosion over Singapore in 2010 was more than 40 pages with diagrams and charts. </p><p> </p><p> The report makes one safety recommendation, for real-time air tracking to be installed on all commercial aircraft. </p><p> <em>“There have now been two occasions during the last five years when large commercial air transport aircraft have gone missing and their last position was not accurately known. This uncertainty resulted in significant difficulty in locating the aircraft in a timely manner,”</em> the report states. </p><p> The same recommendation was made after the Air France jet crashed into the Atlantic in 2009, though nothing was done to satisfy the proposal. </p><p> There is also anger at why Malaysian authorities delayed making their report available to passengers' relatives and the public, even though the same report was delivered to the International Aviation Organization some days ago. </p><p> Relatives advised to go home </p><p> Malaysia Airlines has advised the families of passengers to go home, adding that they will receive any further updates by phone or other means. </p><p> Since the aircraft's disappearance, the airline has been providing hotels for the families. Malaysia Airlines has stated it will close its support centers by May 7, though it will open two different <em>“family support centers”</em> in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur. </p><p> The airline also announced Thursday that it will start paying advance compensation to MH370 passengers' next-of-kin to help with their immediate economic needs. </p><p> </p><h2> Where is the plane wreckage? </h2><p> The report's release comes just one day after the large-scale air search – which was being operated out of the Royal Australian Air Force base in Pearce, north of Perth, for more than six weeks – was finally called off. </p><p> Despite over ten planes taking part in the search, nothing from the missing aircraft was found. A scaled-down search by ships and submersible vessels will continue for an indefinite amount of time. </p><p> GeoResonance, an Australian firm, says it has used spectral analysis from satellite and plane images to detect the presence of aluminum, titanium, and copper in the Bay of Bengal, which it says is from a commercial jet. </p><p> But GeoResonance’s claims are not supported by the majority of aviation experts. </p><p> <em>“My blood is boiling. I’ve talked to the leading experts in satellite capability in NASA, and they know of no technology that is capable of doing this. I am just horrified that a company would use this event to gain attention like this,”</em> Miles O’ Brien, an aviation expert, told CNN. </p><p> But with the search area in the southern Indian Ocean yielding no results, investigators have to take all claims seriously. Bangladesh has sent two navy ships to the location in the Bay of Bengal cited by GeoResonance. </p><p> <em>“I think at this point, because of the lack of results where they’ve been searching for weeks, they’re almost stuck. They have to go look,”</em> said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the US Department of Transportation. </p><p> The search began in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam until it was revealed by satellite data that the missing plane was still airborne for seven-and-a-half hours after it lost contact with air traffic control. </p><p> After this, researchers analyzing the data said the plane most likely came down somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, off the coast of Australia. </p><p> A new search then began, coordinated by Australia and involving planes and ships from eight nations – Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Malaysia, the US, Japan, South Korea, and China. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156212-obama-biden-vacation-tab-40/</guid><title><![CDATA[Fighting income inequality: Obama-Biden vacation tab reaches $40 mn]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156212-obama-biden-vacation-tab-40/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/40/00/obama-biden.jpg" title="US President Barack Obama (R) and Vice President Joe Biden  (AFP Photo / Jewel Samad)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 17:48:39 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/23/40/00/obama-biden.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A vacation tab racked up by President Obama and Vice President Biden has gotten pretty hefty – reaching $40 million, according to a taxpayer watchdog group.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/40/00/obama-biden.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="US President Barack Obama (R) and Vice President Joe Biden  (AFP Photo / Jewel Samad)" /> <p> In a statement released by Judicial Watch, the group stated it had gotten its hands on documentation from the US Air Force, via Freedom of Information Act requests, that reveals the cost of flying Obama and Biden alone routinely exceeds hundreds of thousands of dollars per hour in the air. </p><p> According to the Washington Examiner, which obtained the release, the president’s two golf outings this year cost roughly $2.9 million in taxpayer funds. </p><p> Judicial Watch estimates that since 2009, American taxpayers have spent about $40 million flying Obama and Biden to various destinations – not just golf outings in Palm Springs, California, but also for vacations to Hawaii and trips to Africa. </p><p> Additionally, the group stated that even more money is spent on accommodation, vehicle transportation, Secret Service protection, and other things. The president of Judicial Watch says the amount of spending amounts to <em>"abuse."</em> </p><p> <em>“It is clear that the Obamas continually abuse the perks of the president’s office at taxpayer expense,”</em> said Tom Fitton, according to the Examiner. <em>“And it is particularly interesting that Obama has chosen to take not one but two luxury vacations back-to-back while inveighing against ‘income equality.’ President Obama’s waste of the hard-earned tax dollars of working Americans on unnecessary luxury travel is an abuse of office.”</em> </p><p> This isn’t the first time the cost of the president’s travel has been subject to scrutiny by Judicial Watch. In March, the group announced that Obama’s trips to Hawaii and Africa in 2013 cost nearly $16 million in flight costs alone. In particular, the trip to Africa was criticized by some after reports indicated that, based on previous presidential journeys to the continent, it could cost between $60 million and $100 million. </p><p> With the trip taking place as sequestration forced cuts in various government agencies, Obama's political opponents have criticized him for taking the trip while canceling White House tours. </p><p> <em>“For the cost of this trip to Africa, you could have 1,350 weeks of White House tours,”</em> Rep. George Holding (R-N.C.) said at the time. <em>“It is no secret that we need to rein in government spending, and the Obama administration has regularly and repeatedly shown a lack of judgment for when and where to make cuts.”</em> </p><p> But those with experience in planning presidential trips have chalked up the costs as par for the course. </p><p> <em>“Even in the most developed places of Western Europe, the level of support you need for mass movements by the president is really extraordinary,”</em> said Steve Atkiss, who helped coordinate travel under President George W. Bush, to the Washington Post. <em>“As you go farther afield, to less-developed places, certainly it’s more of a logistical challenge.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156204-nato-vershbow-russia-adversary/</guid><title><![CDATA[NATO’s second-in-command says Russia is now an enemy, not a partner]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156204-nato-vershbow-russia-adversary/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/22/c0/00/nato-official-russia-now-an-adversary.jpg" title="NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow (AFP Photo / Yuri Kadobnov)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 17:08:46 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/22/c0/00/nato-official-russia-now-an-adversary.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow now says that the allied group has been compelled to treat Russia “as more of an enemy than a partner,” according to an Associated Press report published Thursday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/22/c0/00/nato-official-russia-now-an-adversary.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow (AFP Photo / Yuri Kadobnov)" /> <p> The 61-year-old former United States ambassador to Russia reportedly told journalists this week that Moscow’s role in the ongoing crisis in Ukraine has forced NATO to reconsider the alliance’s opinion on Russia, and that additional troops may soon be mobilized to the region as tensions worsen. </p><p> AP journalist Robert Burns <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/nato-official-russia-now-adversary-150211090--politics.html" target="_blank">wrote</a> on Thursday that Vershbow said the Kremlin’s perceived part in the recent events in Ukraine “<em>marks a turning point in decades of effort by NATO to draw Moscow closer</em>.” </p><p> NATO’s second-in-command reportedly told journalists that the alliance is now considering new measures meant to counter any future acts of aggression on the part of Russia aimed at partner nations, and soon could deploy a larger number of combat forces to Eastern Europe. </p><p> Journalists reporting for <a href="http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27186" target="_blank">Civil.Ge</a> wrote on Thursday that Vershbow told the audience at a panel discussion in Washington, DC one day earlier that NATO should deploy “<em>defensive assets to the region</em>.” </p><p> <em>“We need to step up our support for defense reforms and military modernization of Russia’s neighbors, and not just of Ukraine, but also Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,”</em> Vershbow said, according to the Civil Georgia site. </p><p> NATO should think about “<em>upgrading</em>” joint exercises among partner nations, the site quoted Vershbow as saying during the event, while acknowledging that deploying forces to Georgia would be a “<em>controversial</em>” maneuver. </p><p> <em>“It is also important for the United States to show leadership… to make sure that next steps that NATO will make, for example at the summit in September, will be adequate response to what’s happening in Ukraine,</em>” the Georgian Defense Minister Irakli Alasania said during the discussion. </p><p> <em>“The West should now seize the opportunity and create the reality on the ground by accepting membership of aspirant countries, by putting purely defensive assets in aspirant countries and predominantly in Georgia,”</em> Alasania added. <em>“What is important now is to put some deterrent capabilities on the ground like air defense and anti-armor capabilities that will give us a chance to defend our freedom, because we know that if things go wrong at this point no one is coming to save us; we’ve seen that in 2008.”</em> </p><p> Earlier this week, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the builduip of NATO troops near Russia’s border was “<a href="http://rt.com/news/155476-shoigu-hagel-ukraine-rhetoric/" target="_blank">unprecedented</a>.” Weeks earlier, the US Air Force commander in charge of NATO’s military presence in Europe said that US troops may soon be <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-troops-nato-ukraine-484/" target="_blank">deployed</a> to the region as tensions continue to worsen near the border between Ukraine and Russia. </p><p> For weeks now, officials in Washington and Kiev have claimed that the recent separation of Crimea from Ukraine and the rash of uprisings in the country’s eastern part are the direct result of destabilization efforts spearheaded by Moscow, and both the US and European Union have introduced several rounds of sanctions against Russia as a result. The Kremlin has refuted these claims and rebuffed the sanctions, however, and earlier this week Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin <a href="http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/" target="_blank">accused</a> the White House of orchestrating the Ukrainian crisis. </p><p> <em>“I think what is happening now shows us who really was mastering the process from the beginning.

Although it started off covering only about 20 acres of forest, strong and unpredictable gusts of wind from the neighboring mountains quickly spread the fire through 200 acres in a span of two hours. </p><p> By the middle of the day, the fire had scorched through more than 1,000 acres of land, buoyed by winds up to 80 miles per hour. According to the Los Angeles Times, the fire had only been 10 percent contained by Thursday morning. </p><p> </p><p> With smoke promptly making its way to the edges of Rancho Cucamonga – a city with a population of 165,000 people – the US Forest Service employed a mandatory evacuation, forcing residents from 1,650 homes due to the instability of the fire. Local schools were also evacuated. </p><p> <em>“Any time they tell me it’s time to go, I can get out of here. I don’t want to be in anyone’s way,”</em> said local resident Barbora Konecna to the LA Times in a separate report. <em>“With the wind going the way it is, you just don’t know.”</em> </p><p> According to KTTV Los Angeles, the mandatory evacuation had been lifted by 6 p.m. Wednesday, though a voluntary evacuation remains in place. Damage has been reported to one home in Rancho Cucamonga, with residents on alert in case changing wind patterns necessitate further action. </p><p> </p><p> Speaking with CNN affiliate KCBS on Wednesday, Bob Poole of the US Forestry Service said the conditions were too risky to use aircraft to battle the flames. </p><p> <em>"The big challenge on these fires is the wind and the unpredictability, and with winds like this we can't put up aircraft. It's just too dangerous,”</em> he said. <em>“So we try and figure out where it's going to end up and put our resources there.”</em> </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KIZ4yPCSf7Y" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> With hundreds of firefighters and dozens of trucks involved and hoping to make gains against the fire, the National Weather Service’s Miguel Miller said there was mixed news coming in for Thursday’s efforts. </p><p> <em>“The bad news is, we're going to have some tough, hot, dry, windy conditions to fight that fire, and in case any other fire gets started, it's going to spread quickly,”</em> he said. <em>“The good news is, conditions will improve this afternoon.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156176-military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket/</guid><title><![CDATA[Military sexual assault reports skyrocket 50 percent]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156176-military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/21/00/00/military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket.jpg" title="Reuters / Finbarr O'Reilly"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 15:46:27 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/21/00/00/military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Members of the United States military are increasingly coming forward regarding sexual assault – so much so that the number of cases reported have shot up by 50 percent.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/21/00/00/military-sexual-assualt-report-skyrocket.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Finbarr O'Reilly" /> <p> Following a recent push by the Pentagon to encourage victims to step forward and report abuses, a new survey – scheduled for release Thursday – is expected to show there were more than 5,000 cases of sexual assault during the 2013 fiscal year ending September 30. During the previous fiscal year, more than 3,300 cases were reported. </p><p> What’s more, the Associated Press is reporting that the Pentagon was able to discipline in some way about 73 percent of those accused of assault, a seven percent increase over 2012. </p><p> Notably, though, the military is still frustrated with the number of men who are not reporting cases of assault – ranging from unsolicited sexual contact to rape and sodomy. About 6.2 percent of women reported being sexually assaulted last year, but only 1.2 percent of men did. Despite the gap in percentage, there were still more cases of men being assaulted (nearly 14,000) than women (a little more than 12,000). </p><p> Considering the number of men in the military dwarfs the number of women, officials are looking at new ways to encourage men to report abuse when they see or experience it. </p><p> <em>"There is still a misperception that this is a women's issue and women's crime,"</em> Nate Galbreath, an adviser for the Pentagon's sexual assault prevention office, said to the AP. <em>"It's disheartening that we have such a differential between the genders and how they are choosing to report."</em> </p><p> Despite the documentation of a surge in reported abuse, some have criticized the Pentagon’s upcoming report for its methodology. According to the New York Times, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) wrote a letter to the Defense Department last week raising concern over the possibility that the survey adjusted the military’s definition of unwanted sexual contact, writing it <em>“will make it impossible to determine whether the data accurately reflects the impact of the policies and procedures instituted by the Armed Forces.”</em> </p><p> For its part, the Pentagon said it is making progress. </p><p> <em>“For us, the 50 percent increase in reporting is significant,”</em> Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John F. Kirby said to the Times. <em>“Obviously you want to get to zero incidents, but the fact that more victims are coming forward tells us that their confidence in the system is growing. And that’s a good thing.”</em> </p><p> In the past, many victims of sexual assault declined to come forward, especially against those higher in rank, out of fear. Others who did report a case said they were often ignored. As noted by the AP, an anonymous 2012 survey showed roughly 26,000 service members claimed being assaulted. Lawmakers such as Gillibrand, meanwhile, claim only one out of every 10 cases are actually reported. </p><p> A recent case involving a US Army general accused of sexually assaulting a female captain ended in March with the general being fined and spared any jail time – a sentence that surprised many who expected a harsher sentence. As RT reported then, the general was initially charged with forcible sodomy among other things, and pleaded guilty to adultery and mistreating his accuser. </p><p> According to Major Gen. Jeffrey Snow of the Pentagon’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, Thursday’s report did not suggest that the number of crimes in the military has increased, and it is believed the spike is due to increased confidence in the Pentagon’s willingness to go after abusers. </p><p> <em>"There is no indication that this increase in reporting constitutes an increase in crime,"</em> he said. <em>"We assess that this unprecedented increase is consistent with a growing confidence in the response systems."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156172-scotus-ndaa-hedges-obama/</guid><title><![CDATA[Supreme Court refuses to stop indefinite detention of Americans under NDAA]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156172-scotus-ndaa-hedges-obama/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/20/c0/00/scotus-declines-to-hear-ndaa.jpg" title="The exterior of the U.S. Supreme Court is seen in Washington (Reuters / Gary Cameron)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 15:46:22 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/20/c0/00/scotus-declines-to-hear-ndaa.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The United States Supreme Court this week effectively ended all efforts to overturn a controversial 2012 law that grants the government the power to indefinitely detain American citizens without due process.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/20/c0/00/scotus-declines-to-hear-ndaa.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="The exterior of the U.S. Supreme Court is seen in Washington (Reuters / Gary Cameron)" /> <p> On Monday, the high court said it won’t weigh in on challenge filed by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges and a bevy of co-plaintiffs against US President Barack Obama, ending for now a two-and-a-half-year debate concerning part of an annual Pentagon spending bill that since 2012 has granted the White House the ability to indefinitely detain people <em>"who are part of or substantially support Al-Qaeda, the Taliban or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States.”</em> <br><br> The Obama administration has long maintained that the provision — Section 1021(b)(2) of the <a href="http://rt.com/trends/national-defense-authorization-act-indefinite-detention/" target="_blank">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> — merely reaffirmed verbiage contained within the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, signed by then-President George W. Bush in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. <br><br> Opponents, however, argued that the language in Section 1021 of the NDAA is overly vague and could be interpreted in a way that allows for the government to detain without trial any American citizen accused of committing a “<em>belligerent act</em>” against the country “<em>until the end of hostilities</em>.” <br><br> When the provision was first <a href="http://rt.com/usa/obama-hedges-ndaa-sued-933/" target="_blank">challenged</a> days after Pres. Obama signed it into law on December 31, 2011, Hedges — who previously worked as a war correspondent for the New York Times and covered matters concerning Al-Qaeda for the paper — said, <em>“I have had dinner more times than I can count with people whom this country brands as terrorists … but that does not make me one.”</em> <br><br> US District Judge Katherine Forrest <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-court-law-unconstitutional-031/" target="_blank">agreed</a> with Hedges and his co-plaintiffs, and months later wrote in a 112-page opinion that <em>“First Amendment rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and cannot be legislated away.”</em> <br><br><em>"This Court rejects the government's suggestion that American citizens can be placed in military detention indefinitely, for acts they could not predict might subject them to detention,”</em> Judge Forrest wrote. <br><br> But the District Court’s temporary, then permanent <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-court-law-unconstitutional-031/" target="_blank">injunction</a> against Sec. 1021 was challenged by the White House, and the Obama administration pleaded with the Justice Department to issue a <a href="http://rt.com/usa/appeals-ndaa-detention-public-536/" target="_blank">stay</a>. A federal appeals court ruled in <a href="http://rt.com/usa/obama-ndaa-appeal-suit-229/" target="_blank">favor</a> of the president last July and said that the government can, in fact, indefinitely detail a person who has provided support to anyone deemed a threat to America. <br><br> On his part, Hedges said he feared that the administration’s adamant attempts to keep the law in tact could mean that <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ndaa-reddit-plaintiffs-hedges-143/" target="_blank">the government has already relied on the NDAA</a> to imprison American citizens without trial. Attorneys for the plaintiffs responded by saying they would <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ndaa-scotus-hedges-suit-359/" target="_blank">take the case to the Supreme Court</a>, but his week the nine-justice panel said they won’t be hearing the case. <br><br> SCOTUS declined to make any comment regarding the case on Monday, but rather simply said that it would not be considered by the high court. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OZnKKMFL6no?feature=player_detailpage" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> <br> Last year, Hedges <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ndaa-scotus-hedges-suit-359/" target="_blank">warned</a> that the odds the court would take the case were slim, and said rejection on that level could lead to grave consequences with regards to freedoms in America. <br><br><em>“If we fail, if this law stands, if in the years ahead the military starts to randomly seize and disappear people, if dissidents and activists become subject to indefinite and secret detention in military gulags, we will at least be able to look back on this moment and know we fought back,”</em> he wrote. <br><br> On Monday this week, activist and co-plaintiff Tangerine Bolen <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s1igp1" target="_blank">wrote</a> that the high court’s decision to ignore the case means that <em>“the fundamental right of due process and our fundamental rights of free speech and association . . . no longer matter.”</em> <br><br><em>“We have tried to stand up to this madness: we are outnumbered, outspent and outgunned - a David intrepidly fighting a Goliath that spans the planet and has the power to shape our 'reality' - thus shaping what the courts even see.

Both the gas and the chemicals used to extract it can leak into drinking water, and this is not being properly monitored, the report says. </p><p> <em>“For large-scale shale gas development now, I don’t think you want to be in a position anymore of just saying ‘trust me, we know what we’re doing.’ We’re past that,”</em> said Chalaturnyk. </p><p> The study says Canadians are suspicious they are not being told the full story about the dangers of fracking and that more research is needed to reassure people. </p><p> But even the scientists are in disagreement as there are many questions about the impacts of fracking that are hard to answer. </p><p> <em>“Unfortunately the science is at such an immature stage you’ve got widely different views,</em>” said John Cherry of Guelph University. </p><p> The authors also note that because of the different environments, ecosystems, geographies and geologies in Canada, regional impacts need to be considered when determining if an area is suitable for shale gas extraction. </p><p> In western Canada, where shale gas extraction has been developed under existing regulations for conventional oil and gas drilling, further changes may be needed. For example, the cement casings that surround wells to keep natural gas isolated from the environment are subject to much higher pressures and more wear and tear in hydraulic fracturing than in conventional drilling. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156164-marijuana-concert-colorado-orchestra/</guid><title><![CDATA[High note: Colorado Symphony Orchestra to host weed-friendly concerts]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156164-marijuana-concert-colorado-orchestra/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/20/40/00/marijuana-concert-colorado-orchestra.jpg" title="A woman blows smoke rings with marijuana smoke during the 4/20 Rally at the Civic Center in Denver, Colorado, April 20, 2014 (Reuters / Mark Leffingwell)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 14:32:09 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/20/40/00/marijuana-concert-colorado-orchestra.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Colorado Symphony Orchestra will host a series of bring-your-own-marijuana concerts across the state.

"<em>Part of our goal is to bring in a younger audience and a more diverse audience, and I would suggest that the patrons of the cannabis industry are both younger and more diverse than the patrons of the symphony orchestra</em>." </p><p> Companies looking to cash in on Colorado’s nascent pot industry will sponsor the concerts. Principal sponsor of the event, Ideal 420 Soils, produces nutrients to grow the “<em>highest quality marijuana in the marketplace</em>,” while secondary sponsors Gaia and The Farm both produce medical and recreational marijuana. </p><p> </p><p> Due to the nature of the event, the organizers have set an age limit of 21 and encourage their audience not to drive. </p><p> Colorado and Washington became the first states in the US to legalize the consumption and sale of marijuana in 2012. In January, Colorado began to sell the drug over the counter, yielding over $2 million in profits in the first month. </p><p> Lawmakers in Colorado are now discussing possible regulations related to edible marijuana after two deaths in the state were linked to the consumption of the drug. At present, Colorado law states that 10mg of THC – marijuana’s active ingredient – is equivalent to one serving of the drug, but edible products are not required to be sold in a single serving, nor does the law require pot producers to split the package up into separate servings. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156152-greenpeace-russia-oil-protest/</guid><title><![CDATA[Dutch police arrest Greenpeace activists for trying to block Russian tanker]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156152-greenpeace-russia-oil-protest/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1f/80/00/greenpeace-russia-oil-protest.jpg" title="Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior, passes Russian oil tanker Mikhail Ulyanov after members of Greenpeace draped banners saying &quot;No Arctic Oil&quot; from it, in the harbour of Rotterdam May 1, 2014 (Reuters / Michael Kooren)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 13:08:16 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1f/80/00/greenpeace-russia-oil-protest.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Dutch police have stormed a Greenpeace vessel and arrested around 30 activists, as they tried to stop a Russian oil tanker from docking in Rotterdam.

The military and the police are everywhere, in different uniforms, marching or in armored vehicles. The streets are cordoned off with a barbed wire.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/1f/40/00/iraq-new-parliament-us.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Photo by Nadezhda Kevorkova" /> <p> Very few people are out and about. Parks and embankments have been deserted since Saturday. Shops, restaurants and all other public places are closed – starting from Friday, they are taking their days off. Kids are playing football on empty side streets. </p><p> Entering the country has been forbidden since Monday. All flights have been canceled and bus services have been suspended. Nobody can get in or out of Baghdad. This is the atmosphere in which the first Iraqi parliamentary elections are being since the withdrawal of US forces. Somehow people have forgotten that when the Americans were here, it was problematic to cross a street, let alone enter the country. </p><p> The mass media all over the world present Iraq as bankrupt and overwhelmed with terror. The reason for the terror is not the American invasion 11 years ago, but some inborn inability of different religious groups to exist in a civilized manner. Iraqi journalists are concerned about the fact that four US channels are reportedly planning to open offices in Baghdad after the elections. <em>“They invited me to work for them. They are looking for people. The US mass media don’t turn up for no reason. They always know if something is about to unfold somewhere,”</em> one journalist says. </p><p> Nobody approves of the measures taken by the government. While US forces were present in Iraq, people tried to avoid talking about the victims. When they left, there’s hardly anyone who wouldn’t criticize Iraq. </p><p> One senior police official, who preferred to stay anonymous, said: <em>“America can’t create good police in Iraq. Our police lack everything.”</em> </p><p> Even US weapons don’t appeal to him. </p><p> <em>“American weapons are bad, but what matters most is the problems they brought to Iraq,”</em> the police representative says. The weapons issue is a moot point, but the problems in Iraq are obvious. </p><p> <em>“Terrorists are very smart. There are experienced people among them. They receive money from abroad,”</em> the officer says. The police carry out no surveillance, have no agents, pretend to be working, they adopted tools and manners from the Americans that were, in his opinion, counter-productive in Iraq; it all astounds him. </p><p> The problem with security in Iraq is bargaining, which is regarded as corruption or lack of discipline by people in the West. </p><p> </p><p> Vigilance means that every soldier checks your ID. My ID was needed when I visited a polling station and they wanted to write my name down on a list of dignitaries. </p><p> If a car has some kind of permit and it’s on the front windshield, it will be stopped every 100 meters anyway. Sometimes soldiers ask for ID, sometimes drivers can salute the officers or joke and move on, but occasionally you need to stop and show your ID. The soldier then pull the barbed wire to one side and let you go. </p><p> Officers use special mirrors on sticks to inspect the bottom of the car and have equipment to detect explosives; usually they ask you to open the hood, but pay no attention to the trunk or those inside the car. <br><br> According to an official from the prime minister’s office, <em>“special services can’t protect themselves, so how can they protect people from bombs?"</em> </p><p> The closer to the polling station, the busier the street gets and the more police you see around. Their duties here are mainly to protect officials. Some of the police go to their APCs for a snack. </p><p> Most of the central voting districts of Baghdad saw the majority of the people vote for Maliki. When I ask a woman in a black hijab with children about her motive, she responds with a certain excitement: <em>“Why not?”</em> </p><p> Young girls declined to share their choice with me. A father of two children voted for a female candidate from al-Hakim, a religious Shia group, which has not sided with Maliki this time. Actually, there were many people who voted for al-Hakim. </p><p> Sheikh Аhmad Khafadgi cast his vote for the Saddikun group. <em>"You need to change everything. It’s not because I am against Maliki, but I am against the strategy of this government, or rather lack of any. If Maliki wins and reshapes his policies in our favor, we will support him,”</em> says the sheikh. He is convinced that cleric Muqtada Sadr’s group is going to grab a solid share of votes. But he does not actually agree with the cleric’s vision. </p><p> </p><p> A woman of 30 came to invalidate her ballot paper. Her parents migrated to Yemen under Saddam Hussein and returned just recently. Her dream is never to get married, travel around the world and see a democratic Iraq one day. </p><p> Mohammad Rayeed is a street photographer. A Shia, he used to serve in the army under Saddam. It’s the third time that he has voted for Maliki’s State of Law.<em>"We support Maliki because he’s a noble man and has a sense of proportion. Life is hard today: we used to have tourists, now there are none. True, Saddam was a dictator but we never had any terror attacks with him in power,"</em> he says. According to him, there’s a wide conspiracy against Iraq that has been arranged from abroad. </p><p> Hussein Ali, a farm worker and a Shia, also votes for Maliki. During Saddam’s tenure, he spent three months in jail and was tortured. <em>“We worked in the field, and they wanted us to join the Baath party. We were angry and that’s why they put me behind bars,”</em> he told me. He cannot become an MP himself. <em>“You need to have a degree to be eligible. But it’s not something that I worry about. We need people in power with a good educational background.”</em> According to him, each poster of the 9,000 candidates features their profession as a key part of their campaign. It’s because people vote for their doctor, their engineer, or PhD holder that everyone in the tribe is proud of. </p><p> A US-leaning prosperous Iraqi points to a poster with pride: <em>“She’s from my tribe.”</em> </p><p> Many US journalists don’t like al-Maliki because he doesn’t smile or laugh or talk like Western people. They don’t understand that Iraqis will never trust a person who laughs out loud or shows his teeth in a broad smile. It’s not the way they do it here; a leader must be reserved. The journalists believe Maliki is following Saddam’s style, but in a decent way. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156160-gas-rally-donetsk-ukraine/</guid><title><![CDATA[Tear gas in Ukraine’s Donetsk as activists seize Prosecutor’s Office (PHOTOS)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156160-gas-rally-donetsk-ukraine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/20/00/00/rally-donetsk-ukraine.jpg" title="Federalization supporters storm the Donetsk Region's prosecutor's office in Ukraine May 1, 2014  (RIA Novosti / Vitaliy Belousov)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 12:36:51 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/20/00/00/rally-donetsk-ukraine.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />May Day celebrations in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, have turned violent as pro-autonomy activists seized the local Prosecutor’s Office.

The UN body warned that if the plan is not revised, the Reef's World Heritage status could be downgraded.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1c/40/00/unesco-barrier-reef-dumping-.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Australia's Great Barrier Reef (AFP Photo)" /> <p> The <a href="http://rt.com/news/barrier-reef-coal-mud-448/" target="_blank">decision</a> to allow three million cubic meters of dredge waste to be disposed of in the Barrier Reef was made in January by an Australian government agency overseeing the area. The waste comes from the earlier approved expansion of the country’s port of Abbot Point – to make way for extensive coal shipments. <br><br> In its first comment on the issue, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) expressed “<em>concern</em>” and “<em>regret</em>” at the decision, which it believes was premature. It was taken before a thorough analysis of the impact it might have on the World Heritage site. <br><br> “<em>Indeed, this was approved, despite an indication that less impacting disposal alternatives may exist,</em>’’ UNESCO said on Thursday in a draft report on the reef's World Heritage status to the World Heritage Committee. <br><br> The body has urged the government to reconsider the dumping plan and in case it proves to be the least damaging option, submit evidence proving the point. <br><br> UNESCO has on the whole noted “<em>serious decline in the condition of the Great Barrier Reef, including in coral recruitment and reef-building across extensive parts of the property</em>." <br><br> It expects Australia to come up with a new report on its efforts for preserving the Great Barrier Reef by February 1, 2015. If that one fails to convince the UN body that the country is doing enough in challenging the World Heritage site’s deterioration, the Great Barrier Reef could be placed on an “<em>in Danger</em>” list, the draft report warns. <br><br></p><p> </p><p> The UN body’s criticism of the dredge waste dumping plan has been welcome by environmentalists. <br><br> "<em>UNESCO'S concern is shared by thousands of Australians and hundreds of leading scientists, and we call on the federal government to ban dumping of dredge in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area prior to the World Heritage Committee meeting in June</em>," WWF Australia spokesman, Richard Leck, said in a statement. <br><br> Government officials, both federal and those in Queensland (where the controversial port expansion is to take place) have produced optimistic comments on the UNESCO report, saying that they will not allow the downgrading of the Reef. <br><br> "<em>I'm very confident that between the work we're doing as a state and the work we're doing with our federal counterparts, we will not see the Reef listed 'in danger'</em>," Queensland's Environment Minister Andrew Powell said, as cited by ABC. <br><br> Once implemented, the project for the creation of a multi-billion-dollar coal port near the Great Barrier Reef would allow for yearly exports of 120 million tons of coal. <br><br> This has also been a matter of concern for environmentalists, who have criticized the project for doubling shipping traffic in the area. <br><br> UNESCO declared the Great Barrier Reef a World Heritage site in 1981. The area, covering some 350,000 square kilometers, is nearly the size of the US state of Montana. It is home to over 2,000 fish species, with new ones being discovered each year. There are also around 4,000 species of coral in the area. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/155920-radical-islam/</guid><title><![CDATA[The gravest threat to stability in the Middle East?

It is growing. It is spreading across the world. It is destabilising communities and even nations. It is undermining the possibility of peaceful co-existence in an era of globalisation. And in the face of this threat we seem curiously reluctant to acknowledge it and powerless to counter it effectively."</em> </p><p> In the very same speech, however, Blair reveals that cognitive dissonance is a psychological condition common to Western ideologues such as himself. He said: <em>“We call for the regime to change in Syria, we encourage the opposition to rise up, but then when Iran activates Hezbollah on the side of Assad, we refrain even from air intervention to give the opposition a chance.”</em> </p><p> The opposition Blair refers to in Syria is primarily made up of the very radical Islamists he describes as the greatest threat to the Middle East and, by extension, the world. He can’t have it both ways. He can’t be against radical Islam on the one hand, yet call for those governments and peoples that are engaged in a life and death struggle against radical Islam to be defeated on the other. </p><p> But Tony Blair also has to answer for his own role in radicalising Muslims. Not only did the wars he advocated and participated in as UK Prime Minister result in chaos and carnage on a biblical scale in the Arab and Muslim worlds, they have led directly to the proliferation of the regressive ideology he now sees fit to rail against. The war in Iraq left the country devastated and has led inexorably to a society polarised along sectarian lines, with extreme violence a daily occurrence over a decade on. Blair’s role in the continuing controversy over the legality of the war has seen his political credibility torn to shreds, with repeated calls for him to face war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court in The Hague following him wherever he goes. </p><p> Yet rather than demonstrate any regret over his role in the disaster of Iraq, it has reached the stage where no drumbeat to war would be complete without the former prime minister banging the loudest. This was confirmed by his response to the vote taken by Parliament in the UK to exclude Britain from any military action against Syria in 2013. Like that embarrassing uncle who ruins every family social gathering with his propensity for saying and doing the most outrageous things, offending everyone in the process, up popped the former prime minister in an interview with the BBC lamenting Britain's historic break from Washington's coattails on the matter of military intervention for the first time in a generation. </p><p> For a man who has made a career, both in and out of British politics, as a proponent of might is right, this was tantamount to sacrilege. And for someone imbued with the belief that Britain's influence in the world is in direct proportion to its willingness to hurl cruise missiles at wherever Washington wants them hurled, it marked nothing less than the nation's ruin. </p><p> </p><p> At least Blair admitted in the BBC interview that the decision taken by the UK Parliament – an institution he treated with such naked contempt whilst Prime Minister - on Syria was heavily influenced by Iraq, the foreign policy disaster which he co-authored and pushed through with George W Bush. </p><p> You might think that even the hint of a lesson from this disaster may have been learned. But, no, the former prime minister’s only regret was over how it had made Britain <em>"hesitant"</em> to repeat it with regard to Syria. </p><p> This to be sure reveals the skewed outlook of a man so occluded from reality in the rarefied world of private jets, corporate boardrooms, and luxury homes and hotel suites he now inhabits, he no longer knows his political arse from his elbow. Not that he ever did, of course, but when prime minister he at least tried to give the impression that his feet were situated somewhere in the vicinity of Planet Earth. </p><p> For let us be under no illusion what the proposed military intervention in Syria would have involved. It would have involved the West entering into a de facto military alliance with – wait for it – radical Islam, given that various radical Islamist armed groups were by then dominating the opposition forces fighting in Syria. </p><p> Moreover, the justification for this proposed military action against the Syrian government at the time - i.e. humanitarian intervention bypassing the UN - would have constituted a breach of international law. No provision exists within the Fourth Geneva Convention<a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5"></a> for one state or any constellation of states to take aggressive military action on this basis. <em>‘Humanitarian Intervention’</em>, it should be noted, is a concept out of the Tony Blair handbook. It was first rolled out to justify NATO’s 1999 air war against the Serbian people in the former Yugoslavia. </p><p> In truth the gravest threat to stability in the Middle East and the world in general is not radical Islam but the Tony Blairs of this world: men who practice statecraft like gangsters, dividing up and policing their territories, smashing every obstacle in their way, interested only in power, wealth, and status. The legacy of Tony Blair is written in the blood of the untold thousands of men, women, and children slaughtered as a direct result of his messianic thirst for Western domination and hegemony. </p><p> Rather than giving speeches to handpicked audiences of the rich, justice demands that Tony Blair be forced to account for his crimes in the dock at the International Criminal Court. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156088-nsa-spies-americans-russians/</guid><title><![CDATA[NSA spies on more US citizens than Russians – Snowden]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156088-nsa-spies-americans-russians/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1b/80/00/nsa-spies-americans-russians.jpg" title="US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden (AFP Photo / Wikileaks)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 09:20:21 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1b/80/00/nsa-spies-americans-russians.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​The NSA gathers more data on American citizens than it does about foreigners, Edward Snowden has said.

He was greeted by a standing ovation from the audience when he received the Ridenhour Award for <em>“Truth-Telling."</em> </p><p> <br> During his speech, the whistleblower said he leaked thousands of classified government documents, detailing the NSA’s mass surveillance programs because <em>“it was the right thing to do, and now I see I’m not the only one who felt that way.”</em> <br><em><br> “I thought the most likely outcome would be spending the rest of my life in prison,”</em> said Snowden. <br><br> He also criticized the Senate and the House Intelligence committees for their lack of oversight on the NSA and the intelligence community. Leveling criticism at the NSA’s director, James Clapper, Snowden blasted him for his <em>“famous lie”</em> during a speech last year. <br><br> In a testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee last March, Clapper stated that the NSA did <em>“not wittingly gather any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.”</em> It was later revealed in Snowden’s documents that the agency does collect metadata indiscriminately from American telephone and internet companies. This prompted Clapper to go back on his statement, admitting it was <em>“erroneous”</em> in an apology letter to Congress. </p><p> <em>“When Clapper raised his hand and lied to the American public, was anyone tried? Were any charges brought?”</em> Snowden asked. <em>“Within 24 hours of going public, I had three charges against me.”</em> <br><br> The 30–year-old former CIA contractor-turned whistleblower is currently residing in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum last year after he fled the US. In response to the massive security leaks, Washington filed for Snowden’s extradition and charged him with theft, <em>“unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person”</em> under the Espionage Act. <br><br> Snowden’s visa will expire this June, but the whistleblower’s lawyer, Jesselyn Radack, says they are confident his visa will be extended for another year. <br><br><em>“Obviously, he misses America and would like to be able to come home,”</em> his attorney, Jesselyn Radack, told Reuters. <em>“We just don’t see that happening in the near future.”</em> <br><br> Radack added that Snowden was open for negotiation with the US Justice Department, but he will not be returning home <em>“to be prosecuted for espionage.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156124-turkey-protests-gas-cannon/</guid><title><![CDATA[Turkish police clash with May Day protesters in Istanbul]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156124-turkey-protests-gas-cannon/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1d/c0/00/turkey-protests-gas-cannon.jpg" title="A protester uses a slingshot while others take cover during a May Day demonstration in Istanbul May 1, 2014 (Reuters / Umit Bektas)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 09:06:37 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1d/c0/00/turkey-protests-gas-cannon.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A massive police operation has cracked down on May Day protests in the Turkish city of Istanbul.

Some activists threw Molotov cocktails and fireworks at police officers, who retaliated with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon. </p><p> <em>“I have already seen a few people injured,”</em> said RT correspondent Sara Firth, who was caught in tear gas and water cannon fire whilst trying to film on the streets of Istanbul. <em>“It shows no signs of letting up at the moment.”</em> </p><p> <a class="video-link-autoprocess" href="/files/news/26/1d/c0/00/sara_web_480p.mp4">Video: /files/news/26/1d/c0/00/sara_web_480p.mp4</a> </p><p> The tear-gassing was so intense in the Besiktas district that some families were forced to evacuate their homes, reported Turkish news agency Hurriyet. </p><p> At least 142 protesters have been detained by police and 90 people, 19 of whom are police officers, have been injured during the protests, according to the Istanbul Governor’s Office. The Hurriyet Daily notes that the number of injured does not include those treated outside of hospitals. </p><p> </p><p> Istanbul’s authorities have taken special measures to ensure protesters do not gain access to Taksim Square, which has become a symbol for the city’s anti-government protest movement. Local press reports that at least 30 special operations units have been deployed around Gezi Park - adjacent to Taksim Square – as well as armored vehicles. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Protestors being detained by police after a clash as they tried to push past police line <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Istanbul&amp;src=hash">#Istanbul</a><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23May1&amp;src=hash">#May1</a><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%231mayis&amp;src=hash">#1mayis</a><a href="http://t.co/ZlmDmgogpp">pic.twitter.com/ZlmDmgogpp</a> </p> <p> — Sara Firth (@SaraFirth_RT) <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraFirth_RT/statuses/461811676640468993">May 1, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> In addition, the Turkish police have also deployed specially designed, portable, steel walls for the first time.

Local media also reported that almost 40,000 police had been deployed throughout the city to prevent May Day Protests. </p><p> </p><p> Prime Minister Taiyyip Erdogan, who has been the target of many anti-government protests, told citizens they should <em>“give up hope”</em> of gaining access to Taksim Square on May 1. However, Turkey’s main trade unions issued a statement on Wednesday calling the ban <em>“irrational”</em> and <em>“illegal”</em> and pledged to hold demonstrations on the square. <br><br><em>“All roads will lead to Taksim on May Day, and our struggle for labor, equality, freedom, justice and peace will continue,"</em> the main unions said in a joint statement on Wednesday. </p><p> Many of the demonstrators took to the streets to commemorate protesters who died in last year’s unrest. </p><p> Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has condemned the protest movement, dismissing demonstrators as <em>“terrorists”</em> and <em>“riff raff.”</em> The Turkish leader has come under fire for what his opposition regard as heavy-handed measures prior to his reelection this March. </p><p> </p><p> Following the dissemination of leaked conversations between government officials in social media, Erdogan ordered Twitter and YouTube to be blocked on March 21. <br><br> In the leaks, government officials discuss a possible plan for military intervention in Syria. <br><br> The Turkish government was obliged to lift a ban on Twitter on March 26 following a Constitutional Court ruling that called the site blockade unconstitutional.

This is a ten-fold increase compared to 2005, when around 130,000 people were using the drug. </p><p> Afghanistan is responsible for about three-quarters of the world’s heroin production, with much of it being cultivated in the Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the south of the country. However, the US has concentrated most of its efforts in the east of Afghanistan, which has relatively little poppy production, as it is safer than working in the south. </p><p> Attempts to limit production and seize heroin have not been helped due to a downscaling of operations by the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force). In 2013, coalition forces managed to seize 41,000 kilograms of opium out of the 5.5 million kilograms produced in Afghanistan. </p><p> <em>“Drug labs, storage sites, and major trafficking networks are concentrated in rural areas that are increasingly off-limits to Afghan forces due the ISAF drawdown and declining security in these areas,”</em> the report found. </p><p> Since NATO began its ‘War on Terror’ in 2001, heroin production in Afghanistan has increased <a href="http://rt.com/news/afghanistan-election-drugs-production-753/" target="_blank">40-fold</a>, according to the head of Russia’s Federal Drug Control Service. <em>“Afghan heroin has killed more than 1 million people worldwide since ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’ began, and over $1 trillion has been invested in transnational organized crime from drug sales,”</em> <a href="http://rt.com/news/nato-afghanistan-anti-narcotics-085/" target="_blank">Viktor Ivanov</a> said earlier at a conference on the Afghan drug problem in 2013. </p><p> Moscow has repeatedly pushed for the eradication of poppy fields in Afghanistan as the simplest solution. NATO, however, seems to have no intention of doing so. </p><p> In 2013, the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics reported that just 7,300 hectares of poppy fields had been destroyed, which was only three percent of the total opium fields in the country. The US has spent $7.5 billion since 2002 trying to combat the problem of opium production. However, despite these vast sums very little impact has been made on the amount of heroin appearing on the world market. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156132-florida-prison-gas-explosion/</guid><title><![CDATA[2 dead, 100-150 injured in explosion at Florida prison - police]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156132-florida-prison-gas-explosion/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1e/40/00/florida-prison-gas-explosion-1.jpg" title="Escambia County Jail facility (Image from google.maps.com)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 08:50:07 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1e/40/00/florida-prison-gas-explosion-1.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />At least 2 people have been killed and 100 injured in a gas explosion at a jail in Pensacola, Florida, according to a spokeswoman.

The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) revealed that BP officials found the mist during a routine inspection on Monday. </p><p> Initial reports said that 27 acres had been covered, although that figure was updated later on Wednesday. The cause is still under investigation, according to the <a href="http://fuelfix.com/blog/2014/04/30/oily-mist-sprayed-over-27-acres-at-prudhoe-bay/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>, but officials know that the mist was made up of a mixture of gas, crude oil, and water. They also reported that while the noxious mist was distributed over such a wide area by 30 mph winds, no wildlife was impacted. </p><p> BP spokeswoman Dawn Patience said the company is “<em>still assessing repairs”</em> and will soon know what, if any, long-term effects the spill could have. </p><p> The Prudhoe Bay region, like elsewhere in the North Slope, is home to a great number of migratory birds and caribou, as well as other animals, such as a massive porcupine herd. Clean-up efforts are expected to be complete before birds pass through the region again in the coming weeks. </p><p> The company was at fault in at least two oil spills in the same region since 2006. That year, an estimated 267,000 gallons of oil seeped through a quarter-inch sized hole in a corroded BP pipeline. That accident went unnoticed for five days, until an oil worker smelled the aroma of crude when driving through the area, according to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/04/30/3432602/bp-oil-spray/" target="_blank">Think Progress</a>. </p><p> The company spent $500 million on upgrading 16 miles of pipeline that transported oil into a processing facility dubbed Gathering Center 2. </p><p> Instead of acting as a warning to the company, though, the 2006 spill only served as a preview for a 2009 spill that sent approximately 14,000 gallons from a pipeline into the tundra and wetlands of Prudhoe Bay. </p><p> “<em>The 2009 spill vividly demonstrates that BP has not adequately addressed the management and environmental compliance problems that have plagued it for many years</em>,” US government lawyers said in a court filing that sought to levy steep fines onto BP, as quoted by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-29/bp-pipeline-rupture-may-force-company-to-pay-more-for-2006-spill.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>. </p><p> “<em>This rupture was the result of a predictable and preventable freezing of produced water within the pipeline that caused the pipe to over-pressurize and burst. Eerily similar to the 2006 spill, BP ignored alarms that warned of the pipe’s eventual rupture and leak</em>.” </p><p> Officials made the most recent finding less than a week after a report from the US National Research Council (NRC) announced that regulators are not prepared to effectively respond to an Arctic oil spill. The 198-page assessment authored by scientists at the request of the American Petroleum Institute and the Coast Guard found that while more research still needs to be done, the current situation is bleak. </p><p> “<em>The lack of infrastructure in the Arctic would be a significant liability in the event of a large oil spill,</em>” the report stated, as quoted by the <a href="http://fuelfix.com/blog/2014/04/23/report-us-ill-prepared-to-tackle-arctic-oil-spills/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>. “<em>It is unlikely that responders could quickly react to an oil spill unless there were improved port and air access, stronger supply chains and increased capacity to handle equipment, supplies and personnel</em>.” </p><p> Most of the information regulators have gathered on how to respond to oil spills comes from warmer areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico – the site of another massive BP oil spill in April 2010. Yet the drilling areas far to the north remain largely isolated from the resources in the Gulf, with the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest deep water port. </p><p> As such, the NRC recommended the US quickly institute “<em>a comprehensive, collaborative, long-term Arctic oil spill research and development program</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/156080-ukraine-gas-debt-russia/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia reaches $3.5 bn]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/156080-ukraine-gas-debt-russia/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1b/00/00/ukraine-gas-debt-russia.jpg" title="Reuters / Stringer"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 03:12:07 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1b/00/00/ukraine-gas-debt-russia.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia has hit $3.5 billion, according to preliminary data released on Wednesday, a Gazprom official told reporters.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1b/00/00/ukraine-gas-debt-russia.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Stringer" /> <p> The new data includes Ukraine’s Naftogaz order as of April 30 and those volumes that were already supplied this month, Sergey Kupriyanov stated. </p><p> Ukraine's energy minister, Yury Prodan, responded, stating that Ukraine does now agree with Russia’s gas debt estimate of US$3.5 billion, UNN news agency reported. Prodan added that Ukraine continues to insist on the price of $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters for Russian gas. </p><p> Last week, Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said that Ukraine’s growing gas debt may lead to the failure of the country’s <a href="http://rt.com/business/155100-ukraine-gas-debt-eu/" target="_blank">transit</a> obligations and the reduction of gas supplies to southeastern Europe. </p><p> The debt may force a situation where not enough gas will be pumped into Ukrainian underground storage facilities, which may create the risk of non-performance by Ukraine of its transit obligations and of an undersupply of gas to southeastern Europe, the minister stated. </p><p> In December, Russia provided Ukraine with a $3 billion loan, which was part of a larger $15 billion aid package agreed the same month. Moscow also offered a 33 percent gas price discount that would have saved more than $7.5 billion. </p><p> In April, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that Russia cannot continue to <a href="http://rt.com/business/putin-ukraine-economy-gas-353/" target="_blank">prop up</a> Ukraine’s faltering economy. </p><p> <em>“The Russian Federation doesn’t recognize the legitimacy of the authorities in Kiev, but it keeps providing economic support and subsidizing the economy of Ukraine with hundreds of millions and billions of dollars. This situation can’t last indefinitely,”</em> Putin said. </p><p> Ukraine has not paid for Russian gas since the beginning of 2013, and with all discounts withdrawn it is now charged $485 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156076-rob-ford-break-crack/</guid><title><![CDATA[Toronto Mayor Rob Ford to take leave of absence following new crack video]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156076-rob-ford-break-crack/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1a/c0/00/rob-ford-break-crack.jpg" title="Rob Ford (Reuters / Mark Blinch)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 02:07:04 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1a/c0/00/rob-ford-break-crack.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Toronto Mayor Rob Ford says he will take a leave of absence from his job and re-election campaign to address his substance abuse problem.

Once it was more widespread among the Cuban population, it would introduce political content that would attempt to inspire Cubans to <em>"renegotiate the balance of power between the state and society.”</em> </p><p> Despite the State Department’s assertions that the program was not used to influence political leanings, AP reported Wednesday that cell phone users were categorized in databases as being <em>“pro-revolution,” “apolitical,”</em> or <em>“anti-revolutionary.”</em> </p><p> One young contractor working on the project was Paula Cambronero, whose first job out of college was working on how Cubans interacted with ZunZuneo messages carefully – and quietly – sent from Spanish phone numbers. The contractor asked Cambronero to communicate with staff over encrypted channels, and emails were sent from a domain name “not publicly linked” to the contractor. </p><p> Her employer – not named by AP – told her that she would be dealing with a <em>"considerable amount of sensitive information that must be safeguarded to protect critical operations of the Project."</em> USAID even established a dummy company in the Cayman Islands to cover any money trail associated with ZunZuneo. </p><p> Cambronero’s responsibility was to build a database of unsuspecting Cuban cell phone users that responded to ZunZuneo messages, using classifications like gender, age, location, <em>“receptiveness,”</em> and <em>“political tendencies.”</em> She would analyze how users reacted to overtly political messages written by a hired Cuban satirist that poked at the nation’s leaders. </p><p> Cambronero did not respond to AP’s request for comment. The State Department had no comment to AP on Wednesday. </p><p> </p><p> On Tuesday, USAID spokesman Matthew Herrick told AP that the agency had reviewed the project and offered congressional investigators the selection of messages sent to Cubans. </p><p> Herrick claimed the 249 different messages focused on sports, technology, world news, and trivia, and that the messages <em>"were consistent with the objective of creating a platform for Cubans to speak freely among themselves."</em> </p><p> The political messages crafted by the satirist were sent <em>“under a grant that pre-dated the ZunZuneo project,”</em> Herrick said. </p><p> Yet documents reviewed by AP show that USAID considered the grant a <em>“test phase”</em> of the network that would become ZunZuneo. </p><p> Overall, Cambronero collected more than 700 responses to text messages, analyzing them by two variables: the level of interest in the received messages and the political content of a response. </p><p> She found that 68 percent of responses exhibited mild interest in the ZunZuneo texts. Many responses – 210 total – wanted to know who was sending the anonymous message. </p><p> <em>"Explain your point better because I don't understand and remember that if you haven't done anything you shouldn't fear anything, at least tell me your name if you're not a coward,"</em> said one respondent. </p><p> Others asked for help in obtaining birth certificates of Spanish ancestors, a prerequisite for acquiring a Spanish passport to leave Cuba. </p><p> Only 59 responses were analyzed for political content. Cambronero found 10 that did have <em>“political character,”</em> AP reported, <em>“of which two were counter-revolutionary.”</em> </p><p> In her notes, Cambronero recommended that <em>"messages with a humorous connotation should not contain a strong political tendency, so as not to create animosity in the recipients."</em> </p><p> Upon the ZunZuneo revelations, the Obama administration quickly came under attack and promptly denounced allegations that it covertly plotted to disrupt Cuban politics. </p><p> Condemnation of the program continues to emerge. In Costa Rica, where ZunZuneo was reportedly developed by American officials, the nation’s foreign minister Enrique Castillo <a href="http://rt.com/usa/154624-costa-rica-cuban-twitter/" target="_blank">said</a> last week that not only does he think it was <em>“inappropriate”</em> for the US to use his country to conduct the project, but that he previously warned officials not to involve his Central American country in the endeavor due to fears it would strain Costa Rica’s own relationship with Cuba. </p><p> <em>"I think it's inappropriate to use an embassy in Costa Rica for this type of operation that harms a third country,"</em> Castillo told the AP. <em>"We're not filing a complaint. The point is that embassies accredited in Costa Rica don't have to submit their plans or programs for the Costa Rican government's approval."</em> </p><p> Costa Rica’s minister of communications, Carlos Roverssi, said Wednesday that it will fall on the country’s recently elected government to deal with the matter from here on out. </p><p> <em>"It seems to me that the issue is now public and the next government should follow up on the issue, without a doubt,"</em> he said. </p><p> The US State Department has begun a review of the program, saying it would be <em>“troubling”</em> if ZunZuneo involved political messaging. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156060-lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut/</guid><title><![CDATA[Advocates decry transfer of transgender teen to adult male prison]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156060-lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/c0/00/lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut.jpg" title="Reuters / Dario Pignatelli"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 01:06:32 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/c0/00/lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A judge’s decision to send a troubled 16-year-old transgender teen to a Connecticut prison for adults has alarmed her lawyer and advocates who say the girl, charged with no crime, should be placed in the hands of a caring family.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/c0/00/lawyer-questions-transgender-jail-connecticut.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Dario Pignatelli" /> <p> Identified only as Jane Doe, the youth identifies as a female. She has been under the care of the state since the age of five, when social workers removed her from her family’s home – her father was in jail and her mother was battling an addiction to crack, heroin, and alcohol. </p><p> She was brutally abused multiple times while in the care of the Department of Children and Families (DCF). In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1113035-4-14-14affidavit-redacted-reduced.html" target="_blank">court papers</a> filed this month, she claims that she was repeatedly raped while having her life threatened by being punched, kicked, and bashed in the head by family members for playing with dolls. </p><p> “<em>At about age 12 I was placed by DCF at a residential facility in Eagleton School in Massachusetts, where a worker named [redacted] used to show the other children pornographic magazines, and on two occasions I was in his office and he had me perform oral sex on him</em>,” she said, among other heinous incidents. </p><p> Authorities said the teen was removed from the care of DCF after attacking a staff member in an assault that left the employee temporarily blinded and with a broken jaw. Despite filing no charges against the girl, the state transferred her to a women’s prison in East Lyme, Connecticut, where she has been kept in her cell for 22 to 23 hours a day in a wing for mentally ill inmates. </p><p> “<em>We are sensitive to the traumatic and difficult experiences the youth has encountered over her life</em>,” said a DCF statement issued earlier this month. “The judge who issued the transfer order heard evidence over a six-day period in which there was ample evidence provided by numerous witnesses stating under oath that the youth has propensity for violence. </p><p> “<em>The youth has an extensive history of violence, including targeting female staff at several programs as well as other girls in the program</em>,” the statement went on. </p><p> Advocates disagreed with that decision, saying that if the allegations of assault are indeed correct, it’s only natural for such a troubled youth to react in unpredictable ways. </p><p> “<em>This is a youth that has not been convicted of an adult crime in an adult court that is now being placed in an adult correctional facility</em>,” Connecticut state child advocate Sarah Egan told <a href="http://wnpr.org/post/transgender-teen-sent-connecticut-adult-prison" target="_blank">WNPR</a> radio. “<em>This is a tremendously unusual and concerning action by the state against a 16-year-old</em>.” </p><p> The situation has struck some observers as curious because the DCF recently opened the Solnit Center in Middletown, Connecticut, a home for girls with serious emotional issues. The DCF commissioner told WNPR that residents there “<em>have been the victims of trauma; they have been abused; sexually abused, whatever the circumstances are, and they need that much more of an intensive-based treatment</em>.” </p><p> Earlier this month, Aaron Romano, the girl’s attorney, pressed for a court order that would have made the situation even worse. Romano told the <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-transgender-juvenile-sent-to-prison-20140409,0,6060233.story?page=1" target="_blank">Hartford Courant</a> there is a risk that the transgender teen could be transferred to the Marion Correctional Institution, a prison for males under 21 years of age. </p><p> “<em>This is really an embarrassment for DCF and the state on several levels</em>,” he said. “<em>Had DCF followed through in its child-protection mandate, this child would now be at Middletown juvenile facility</em>.” </p><p> The American Civil Liberties Union and GLAAD (formerly known as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) have spoken out against the possible transfer. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156068-revived-silk-road-bigger/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘Revived’ illicit online bazaar Silk Road ‘bigger than ever’ as Feds fail to keep up]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156068-revived-silk-road-bigger/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1a/40/00/silk-road.jpg" title="Image from the Digital Citizens Alliance report"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 01:06:14 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/1a/40/00/silk-road.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The notorious website Silk Road – which served as a middleman that allowed its customers to anonymously buy drugs, weapons, and criminal software – is more popular than ever, despite the arrest of its founder six months ago, says a new report.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/1a/40/00/silk-road.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Image from the Digital Citizens Alliance report" /> <p> “<em>Approximately 13,648 listings for drugs are now available on Silk Road compared to the 13,000 that were listed shortly before the FBI arrested Ross William Ulbricht and shut down the site. The Darknet drug economy as a whole contains 75 percent more listings for drugs,</em>” claims a newly published <a href="https://media.gractions.com/314A5A5A9ABBBBC5E3BD824CF47C46EF4B9D3A76/5f8d4168-c36a-4f78-b048-f5d48b18dc0a.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the Digital Citizens Alliance, a public group dedicated to reducing online crime. <br><br> Though US authorities have charged Ulbricht with conspiracy to distribute narcotics, for designing and operating the website that allowed users to buy anything apart from child pornography and weapons of mass destruction, his website has been reopened with an identical interface to reassure loyal buyers. <br><br> Even Ulbricht’s alleged moniker, Dread Pirate Roberts, has been appropriated by another administrator, who users refer to as DPR2. <br><br> February’s theft of users’ virtual currency bitcoin – worth more than $2.6 million – only seems to have “<em>reassured</em>” users. The administrators of the site have promised to repay the money instead of shutting off services and disappearing as others have done on the so-called 'Darknet' – an unregulated part of the internet accessed through anonymous software. <br><br> The detentions of three more people possibly connected to the operation, and rumors of further arrests, have not dampened interests, either. <br><br> “<em>The last six months have tested the wherewithal of the Darknet Marketplaces. Arrests, site seizures, scams from small to massive, and an ever-increasing amount of paranoia have challenged those who buy and sell illicit goods online. The Marketplaces have proven resilient and as one closes or disappears, several others pop up to take its place</em>,” alleges the report. <br><br> An appendix provided with the report shows that every single one of the most popular traders on the original Silk Road site either continues to trade there, or has moved onto other services. <br><br> The report's authors say they are not only worried about drugs, but also the general platform that Silk Road provides. <br><br> “<em>While the brazen sales of heroin and crystal meth attract attention, the real money is in underground financial transactions...The true value of Silk Road in the criminal underground is more than drugs; it is the further enabling of secret illicit activity.”</em> <br><br> The Digital Citizens Alliance has chided legislators and government agencies for being unable to keep up with the criminals. <br><br> “<em>The government in general struggles with developing any internet policy, and the cryptonet debate seems even more fraught with apathy,</em>” states the report. <br><br> But few solutions seem apparent. <br><br> “<em>The policy development areas for [anonymizer software] Tor, bitcoin, and Darknet Marketplaces are wide open. US states may see the need to create their own policies or recommend federal ones. States may see the need to regulate bitcoin exchanges in their own jurisdictions or require internet service providers to block Tor use locally, regardless of how technically implausible it might be. This is a brave new world of policy analysis,</em>” the report states. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156048-gary-johnson-us-politics-today/</guid><title><![CDATA[US involvement in Ukraine is like ‘Russia getting involved in Puerto Rico’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156048-gary-johnson-us-politics-today/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/00/00/1gary-johnson-us-politics-today.jpg" title="Gary Johnson"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 00:29:43 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/00/00/1gary-johnson-us-politics-today.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Though Republicans hold a majority of seats in the House of Representatives and Democrats hold a majority of seats in the Senate, a majority of Americans say that neither party represents them.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/00/00/1gary-johnson-us-politics-today.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Gary Johnson" /> <p> According to a new national survey by Rasmussen, 53 percent of likely US voters think that neither political party truly represents the American people. The poll shows that the two-party system is losing ground with Americans – six months ago, in October, only 46 percent of questioned voters said that neither party represents Americans. </p><p> RT’s Lindsay France spoke with 2012 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson about Americans’ lack of representation in the halls of political power. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Now let’s talk about this lack of representation. Seventy-two percent say it would be better if the country didn’t elect the incumbents to Congress this year in November. If they don’t trust either party, the incumbents or the new guys, what’s the alternative? </p><p> <strong>Gary Johnson:</strong> Well, first of all, I agree with the poll. I think this is what we’re all witnessing. I think term limits would really be a silver bullet, the notion that people would get in, do the right thing and get out. And then, Lindsay, you know, a couple of issues of late that really left all the politicians behind: the marriage equality, nobody was standing up for that; the marijuana legalization, the state of Washington, the state of Colorado moving ahead of all politicians; and then if you look at Libya and Syria, the president’s ready to go in militarily, Congress is ready to dot the i’s and cross the t’s on how to do that and, lo and behold, 80 percent of Americans don’t want to do that. Well that’s a good thing. I just wish that Congress would catch up to the fact that this spending is not sustainable and, if they don’t fix this, we’re going to find ourselves in a monetary crisis. We’re going to find ourselves without a country. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about government trust among young voters, those between the ages of about 18 and 29. A new poll surveying young Americans’ political attitudes released by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics [on] Tuesday, found that the millennials’ 'composite trust index,' it’s called, which is the level of trust, on average, in six different public institutions: the presidency, the US military, the Supreme Court, the federal government, and the United Nations, it’s dropped dramatically in just two years...from 39 two years ago down to 31 in mid-April...How do politicians come back from this sort of a drop? We’re talking about the young generation, the young voters here. </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Lindsay, I know you have statistics there on young voters, but I believe that it isn’t just young voters. I think that they are the canary, though, in the coal mine, and that, if politicians don’t get in touch with this, that, really, we’re going to find ourselves...I do already think we’re in a catastrophe of sorts in that we’re not being represented. Of course, having run for the Libertarian nomination for president, I can tell you that whether you’re a Libertarian, whether you’re a Democrat, whether you’re a Republican, you have baggage whether you have that baggage or not. We’re suing the Presidential Debates Commission right now to say if mathematically you are a party that can conceivably be elected president of the United States with enough electoral votes, then shouldn’t you be included in the debates? Just give another voice out there, and the more voices we have with input on where this country should go, I suggest we’ll all be a lot better off. But it is a two-party system, and it’s very exclusionary. I found that out face-to-face. It’s not a good thing. More voices, the better. And I’m not being hypocritical here. As governor of New Mexico, I made it as easy as, I signed legislation making it as easy as possible for third parties to be able to run. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about these other voices. You know, even after the midterm elections, President Obama’s got a while left in the White House. He’s facing <a href="http://rt.com/usa/155720-obama-approval-lowest-of-term/" target="_blank">very low approval ratings</a> right now – extremely low, embarrassingly low. What does this midterm election look like? Can it change things? Will new voices, depending on who makes it in through the midterm elections, change his approval ratings? Will they be able to steer him away from some of those bad decisions? </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Well, I don’t place blame on Obama, I do place blame on the system that is very status quo oriented, that more than anything politicians are concerned with getting reelected, as opposed to doing the right thing...When people don’t vote, it’s a, you know, that’s not a good thing. And maybe we’ll see some huge voter turnout. I have no optimism whatsoever that anything changes in Washington as a result of these midterm elections. Look, I think that the president should be a leader and that he should be controversial and that he should press the things that he wants to do. And Republicans, they should be leading on the issues that they should be strong on, and that would be spending and that would be the deficit. And then both parties, they ought to come together on issues that everybody cares about. I think the majority of Americans – speaking with a broad brushstroke – are fiscally responsible and socially liberal. I always tell people I’m as conservative a politician as you’ve ever met when it comes to dollars and cents, and I’m a flaming liberal when it comes to civil liberties. The militarization of our police forces, this is happening under the guise of both political parties watching this. I mean, it’s getting so bad. One-hundred-and-ten million Verizon users are being monitored by the NSA. This is happening under the eyes of both political parties. There just doesn’t seem to be any hope out there. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about our foreign involvements, which most people will say have been numerous lately. As the saying goes, “Go big or go home.” Well, we’ve gone big, and now it appears it’s time to go home. According to nearly half of the respondents from an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 47 percent of them say the US should become less active in world affairs. Now if you look at what’s going on: US involvement in Ukraine, the Iraq debacle, troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, trying to go into Syria, Libya before that, what is the way forward for those who want votes this election season, with all of the concern Americans feel on these issues? </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Well, the way politicians address this of course is to get tough, drop bombs. I mean, Republicans are all about who’s going to drop the first bomb? What about the notion of free trade? Gosh, is China really an enemy when they’re, you know, our second biggest trading partner? I don’t think so! We should be looking at trade with other countries first and foremost...You don’t go to war against trading partners. But yet we’re always talking about sanctions, and sanctions just don’t work. And when you look at Ukraine right now, I think that would be analogous to Russia getting involved in Puerto Rico. They’re not going to do it. We shouldn’t get involved in Ukraine. There are unintended consequences as a result of our military interventions. I’m going to suggest that we have hundreds of millions of enemies to this country because of our military interventions. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> Well, let’s talk about Ukraine for a minute. Obviously it’s a hot spot in world topics...How should the US approach the crisis in Ukraine? Should the US do more or less? </p><p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Well, less! Look, don’t get involved in Ukraine! It would be like Russia getting involved in the affairs of Puerto Rico. They’re not going to do it! We shouldn’t be involved in Ukraine! There’s no national security interest here at stake. And I know you’ll hear politicians beating their chests, arguing the opposite. Well, I’m going to argue that there is no national security interest here at risk, and the government has an obligation to protect us against foreign governments that might do us harm – this is not one of those situations. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156036-one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘One nation under Allah’: FL conservatives push for anti-Sharia legislation]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156036-one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/40/00/one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria.jpg" title="Rocky Mountain High School, Colorado (Image from 999thepoint.com)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 22:46:21 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/18/40/00/one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Florida conservatives, evidently alarmed by changing social and income demographics, are pushing legislation to combat what they say is the attempted indoctrination of American students with Islamic ideology.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/18/40/00/one-nation-allah-pledge-hysteria.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Rocky Mountain High School, Colorado (Image from 999thepoint.com)" /> <p> Lawmakers are currently considering a so-called “<em>anti-Sharia bill</em>” which passed through the state Senate with a 24-14 vote on Monday. Sharia, which varies between cultures, is the basic path which devout Muslims try to follow. The rules, while strict by Western standards, often stretch past the confines of a mosque and regulate aspects of secular law, including crime, public policy, sex, diet, and economics. </p><p> “<em>Those people who want to come to America, we welcome them, but when you come to America, you are going to be governed under American laws, when you come to Florida you are going to be governed by Florida laws, and we ought not to apologize for that</em>,” Sen. Alan Hays, a Republican, told the <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/blogs/political-pulse/sfl-state-senators-advance-controversial-antisharia-bill-20140428,0,4912559.post" target="_blank">Orlando Sentinel</a> after the bill passed through the state Senate. </p><p> While the bill will now move to the state House of Representatives for approval, members of the Senate were still wondering who, exactly, is trying to impose Islamic restrictions on the mostly Christian Florida population. According to a <a href="http://religions.pewforum.org/maps" target="_blank">recent analysis</a> from the Pew Research Center, a mere one percent of Florida's population is Muslim, compared to the 66 percent of Floridians who practice some form of Christianity. </p><p> “<em>There is no record of Sharia law being implemented in the courts of Florida or any other state</em>,” Sen. Eleanor Sobel, a Democrat who opposed the bill, told the Sentinel. </p><p> Officials were similarly confused when educators, in an apparent attempt to break down cultural barriers, came under attack from members of their community who were trying to do the opposite. </p><p> A controversy erupted in Volusia County, Florida in November when a student brought her social studies textbook home to her parents, who found that the curriculum dedicated a specific section to the history and beliefs of Islam. Experts told the Daytona News Journal that the rest of the book was full of references to Christianity and Judaism, but the first complaint blossomed into a contingency of parents who felt that their rights were somehow being infringed upon. </p><p> “<em>We hope that the School Board will respect our voices in the process of education and reject voices of intolerance and censorship</em>,” a petition calling on administrators to replace the book read. The document failed to explain how an education based on the knowledge of various religions equated to censorship. </p><p> Conservatives in Colorado were equally upset when a Muslim student led the rest of the school in the Pledge of Allegiance while replacing the traditional “<em>under God</em>” with “<em>under Allah</em>.” The pledge was adopted in US schools in 1942 at the height of World War II but was only amended to include “<em>under God</em>” a decade later, as a way for Americans to differentiate themselves from the Soviet Union’s atheism policy during the Cold War. </p><p> Colorado’s Cultural Arms Club, which advertises its mission to “<em>destroy the barriers, embrace the cultures</em>” that exist throughout the region, organized the “<em>under Allah</em>” pledge at Rocky Mountain High School. It quickly came under fire from parents who felt that it would be unpatriotic to utter the pledge in any form other than the traditional one. </p><p> “<em>These students love this country</em>,” school principal Tom Lopez told <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/school-recites-pledge-in-arabic-one-nation-under-allah.html" target="_blank">Fox News</a> at the time. “<em>They were not being un-American in trying to do this. They believed they were accentuating the meaning of the words as spoken regularly in English</em>.” </p><p> The problem, Lopez said, was not that the school was trying to be more inclusive, but that a vocal fraction of the community was so up in arms. </p><p> “<em>I’ve been shocked with prejudicial statements that have been made,”</em> he continued<em>. “I’ve been shocked with the lack of seeking understanding. There’s definitely some suspicion and fear expressed in these people’s minds. There’s some hate</em>,” he said. </p><p> Like Principal Lopez, a growing number of pundits and lawmakers have called for more information on Islamic culture and beliefs. Even now, more than a decade after religious tension heightened in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, nearly two-thirds of Americans asked about other world faiths admitted they had “<em>little or no knowledge</em>” about what Muslims believe, according to New York University professor Jonathan Zimmerman. </p><p> “<em>To live together as citizens of a nation, we need to understand each other’s fundamental assumptions and beliefs about the world</em>,” Zimmerman wrote in the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/give-kids-muslim-holidays-teach-religious-history-schools-article-1.1767687" target="_blank">New York Daily News</a>. “<em>And we can’t do that without understanding religion, which remains the basic wellspring of those beliefs for many of us</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156052-sinn-fein-adams-murder/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams detained over notorious 1972 murder]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156052-sinn-fein-adams-murder/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/40/00/sinn-fein-arrest-murder.jpg" title="Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams (Reuters / Neil Hall)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 21:46:31 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/40/00/sinn-fein-arrest-murder.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Northern Ireland police have detained and questioned Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in connection with the 1972 abduction and murder of Jean McConville by the IRA, his party said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/40/00/sinn-fein-arrest-murder.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams (Reuters / Neil Hall)" /> <p> McConville, a widowed mother of 10, was abducted from her home in west Belfast and shot by the IRA amid fierce sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. She was wrongly accused of being an informant. </p><p> Adams, 65, said in a statement that he was <em>“innocent of any part”</em> of McConville’s death, Reuters reported. Her body was recovered from a beach in County Louth in 2003. </p><p> The Police Service of Northern Ireland said in a statement that a man had “presented himself” to authorities Wednesday evening, but they did not name the suspect. </p><p> Sinn Fein said in a statement: <em>“Last month Gerry Adams said he was available to meet the PSNI about the Jean McConville case. That meeting is taking place this evening."</em> </p><p> Last month, Ivor Bell, a leader in the Provisional IRA in the 1970s, was charged with aiding and abetting McConville’s murder. Other arrests have recently been made in connection with the murder. </p><p> Bell’s case was based on an interview which he allegedly gave to researchers at Boston College in the United States. A series of candid, confessional interviews with former loyalists and republican paramilitaries was taped in an effort to provide an oral history of the Troubles. </p><p> Interviewees were told that the tapes would not be released to the public until after their deaths, but a series of court cases in the US resulted in some of the content being handed to law enforcement. </p><p> An investigation by the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman cleared McConville of accusations that she was an informant. According to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR), McConville was one of 16 people known as the <em>'Disappeared'</em> – those abducted, murdered, and buried in secret by republicans during the era of the Troubles. </p><p> The IRA admitted in 1999 that it murdered and secretly buried nine of the Disappeared. The other seven have yet to be found. The ICLVR is aimed at locating the remains of those still missing. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156056-imf-approves-ukraine-aid/</guid><title><![CDATA[IMF gives green light for $17 bn Ukraine aid package]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156056-imf-approves-ukraine-aid/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/19/80/00/imf-approves-ukraine-aid.jpg" title="The International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters building is seen in Washington, DC (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2014 21:18:47 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/19/80/00/imf-approves-ukraine-aid.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The International Monetary Fund has approved a two-year $17.1 billion loan package for Ukraine.

More than half of that money will be dedicated to supporting the country's budget. </p><p> The package will open up loans from other donors totaling around $15 billion. The goal is for Ukraine to use the money to stabilize its economy. </p><p> <em>"The authorities' economic program supported by the Fund aims to restore macroeconomic stability, strengthen economic governance and transparency, and launch sound and sustainable economic growth, while protecting the most vulnerable,</em>" the IMF said in a statement. </p><p> IMF managing director Christine Lagarde commented on the aid package, stating that the plan may come with geopolitical and implementation risks. </p><p> <em>"On the implementation front, we are taking all the precautions we can in order to mitigate those risks,"</em> Lagarde told reporters on Wednesday. <em>"On the geopolitical front, clearly the bilateral international support, and the cooperation of all parties, will be extremely helpful to reinforce the position of the economy of Ukraine.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> <em>"We believe that Ukraine has an opportunity to seize the moment, to break away from previous practices, both from the fiscal, from the monetary, and from the governance point of view,”</em> Lagarde added. </p><p> Ukraine’s crisis was exacerbated after months of anti-government protests and Crimea’s referendum to join Russia. </p><p> The country's economy is forecasted to contract by three percent due to the chaos and lack of order, according to Ukrainian authorities. The nation's output dropped 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014. </p><p> The ongoing protests, especially in the east of the country, are not helping the nation get its economy back on track. In fact, Ukraine’s acting President Aleksandr Turchinov said on Wednesday that Kiev’s government <a href="http://rt.com/news/155856-ukraine-alert-president-army/" target="_blank">cannot control</a> the situation in the east of the country, and called to speed up the creation of regional militias loyal to Kiev. </p><p> Lagarde noted that further sanctions against Russia may harm Ukraine's economy even further, as its neighboring country is a key export market for Ukraine. </p><p> <em>"Clearly on the front of sanctions, anything that undermines the economic situation of the country will jeopardize the implementation of the program, which is why we very strongly encourage the parties to negotiate, to come to terms,"</em> Lagarde said. </p><p> </p><h2> 'Bold program of reforms' </h2><p> Lagarde argued that Ukraine has already shown its ability to undertake <em>“comprehensive reforms,”</em> listing a few of the sacrifices that have been made. </p><p> <em>“Whether it was a question of letting the exchange rate float, whether it was a question of reforming the procurement law, whether it was a question of modifying the price of gas to customers or to corporate. They’ve (Ukrainian government) done all these things to demonstrate their determination to endorse a very bold program of reforms,”</em> Lagarde stated. </p><p> The IMF money comes with stringent terms, asking for various cuts and economic reforms. In the case of Ukraine, the requirements include a 50 percent increase in the price of gas for households, as well as a quick pension reform and lower government spending. </p><p> The World Bank <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-imf-consumption-decrease-576/" target="_blank">warned</a> on April 10 that the loan terms set by the IMF would cut 2014 consumption in Ukraine by 8 percent, as well as erode capital investment. </p><p> The increased cost of household gas and district heating <em>“will affect purchasing power and limit the government’s ability to boost capital spending this year. Thus, in 2014, we expect to see a decline in both consumption and fixed investment,”</em> the World Bank said in a statement. </p><p> </p><p> Earlier in April, Ukraine’s finance minister, Oleksandr Shlapak, said that <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-imf-debt-russia-864/">paying off</a> debt to Russia would not be a top priority for Ukraine when it secured its first tranche of International Monetary (IMF) bailout cash. </p><p> Ukraine’s total debt to Russia, including the $2.2 billion bill for gas, now stands at $16.6 billion, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. </p><p> Back in December, before the Ukrainian protests turned into a nationwide crisis, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian government would essentially <a href="http://rt.com/business/ukraine-15-billion-gas-381/" target="_blank">buy</a> $15 billion in Ukrainian debt by investing in Ukrainian bonds, using money from Russia's National Welfare Fund. The announcement came after a meeting with then-President Viktor Yanukovich in Moscow. </p><p> The deal included a 33 percent discount for natural gas, which could have save the country $7 billion in 2014. The agreement was hailed by then-Prime Minister Azarov as saving Ukraine from economic ruin. </p><p> Protests in Kiev began in November when Ukraine backed out of a trade negotiation deal with the EU in favor of a debt deal with Russia – a move interpreted by Ukrainians as a decisive step away from integration with the EU. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
