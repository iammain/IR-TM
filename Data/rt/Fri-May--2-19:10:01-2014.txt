Obama said, then sectoral sanctions against Moscow would be”inevitable.” </p><p> Both Pres. Obama and Chancellor Merkel told reporters from the White House rose garden that while a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis is preferred, further steps with regards to sectoral measures in the context of certain branches of industry could soon be announced. </p><p> Such sanctions, Obama said, would “further impact Russia's growth and economy” and be aimed at any of several sectors. At the same time, however, he said his administration hopes imposing further sanctions won't be required. </p><p> “There are a range of approaches that can be taken not only in the energy sector, but in the arms sector, the finance sector, in terms of lines of credit for trade, all that have a significant impact on Russia,” Obama said. </p><p> “This is not necessarily what we want, but we are ready and prepared,” Merkel added. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156468-russia-ukraine-crisis-crackdown/</guid><title><![CDATA[US, EU’s support of Kiev’s tactics blocks peaceful resolution of Ukraine crisis – Russia]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156468-russia-ukraine-crisis-crackdown/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/33/40/00/russia-ukraine-crisis-crackdown.jpg" title="Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin (Reuters / Mike Segar)"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 16:29:13 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/33/40/00/russia-ukraine-crisis-crackdown.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The West has cut all paths to a peaceful solution of the Ukrainian crisis by supporting the Kiev authorities and their violent crackdown on protests in the eastern part of the country, Russia’s envoy Vitaly Churkin told the UN Security Council.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/33/40/00/russia-ukraine-crisis-crackdown.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin (Reuters / Mike Segar)" /> <p> Catastrophic consequences are inevitable if Kiev authorities do not stop their “<em>criminal venture</em>,” Churkin stressed at the emergency UNSC meeting summoned by Moscow on Friday. </p><p> He pointed out that Kiev has flagrantly violated its obligations that were established under the Geneva agreement on April 17.

The teenager reportedly confessed to police after they correctly guessed that he was building explosive devices, and he is believed to have been acting on his own. </p><p> Appearing in juvenile court on Thursday, LaDue was charged with four counts of attempted first-degree murder, six counts of possessing explosive or incendiary devices, and two counts of criminal damage to property. </p><p> As noted by the Free Press, LaDue reportedly laid out his entire plan in a 180-page notebook, in which he also made reference to the school shootings at Columbine, Virginia Tech, and Sandy Hook. the teenager allegedly told police of his plan to shoot his father, mother, and sister with a rifle, ignite a fire in a field to distract first responders, and then proceed to the local high school to continue his assault. </p><p> At the high school, LaDue reportedly said he would set off multiple bombs that he’d made, throw Molotov cocktails, and shoot “as many students as he could.” Three complete explosive devices were found in his room, and the teenager apparently confessed to setting off practice bombs that were found at an elementary school playground in March. </p><p> On Thursday, police stated LaDue could have succeeded in his plan if they weren’t tipped off by a local resident who saw the teenager acting suspiciously at a storage facility. </p><p> <em>“He shut the door, and I thought it looked funny,”</em> Chelsea Shellhas, who phoned police, said to local news outlet WCCO. <em>“Because, normally, we see people come here, and it doesn’t take them 10 minutes to open a storage shed, so that’s why I called it in.”</em> </p><p> When police arrived at the scene, they found LaDue inside with plenty of dangerous material – gunpowder, a pressure cooker, pyrotechnic chemicals, and more, according to CNN. </p><p> <em>"This case is a classic example of citizens doing the right thing in calling the police when things seem out of place. By doing the right thing, (an) unimaginable tragedy has been prevented,"</em> Waseca Police Captain Kris Markeson said, as quoted by the Associated Press. </p><p> LaDue also allegedly told police he was in possession of numerous firearms, including an assault rifle with 400 rounds of ammunition and a Barretta 9 mm handgun. These were later found in his room alongside three bombs. </p><p> <em>“My personal feeling is that I’m very disturbed by the amount of items that he had of that nature,”</em> Markeson told WCCO. </p><p> In addition to studying previous school shootings, the teenager reportedly idolized those behind the Columbine shooting, and hoped to carry out his own plan on its anniversary. April 20, however, fell on Easter Sunday this year, and school was out. </p><p> Speaking with CNN, LaDue’s mother said the family would prefer not to make a statement at this time. </p><p> <em>“Our family is dealing with a lot of grief,”</em> she said. <em>“I appreciate your concern.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156428-philippines-edca-five-bases/</guid><title><![CDATA[American military gets access to upwards of five Filipino bases]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156428-philippines-edca-five-bases/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/30/c0/00/philippines-to-give-u.s.-forces-access-to-up-to-five-military-bases.jpg" title="A U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet jet fighter taxis past a Huey helicopter at the formerly U.S. bases, Clark Air Base, Pampanga province, north of Manila (Reuters / Romeo Ranoco)"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 15:35:08 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/30/c0/00/philippines-to-give-u.s.-forces-access-to-up-to-five-military-bases.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />United States troops will soon have access to upwards of five military bases across the Philippines as the result of an agreement signed earlier this week between nations, the Asian country's chief negotiator told reporters on Friday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/30/c0/00/philippines-to-give-u.s.-forces-access-to-up-to-five-military-bases.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet jet fighter taxis past a Huey helicopter at the formerly U.S. bases, Clark Air Base, Pampanga province, north of Manila (Reuters / Romeo Ranoco)" /> <p> The pact — the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA — was signed on Monday this week ahead of US President Barack Obama's stop in the Filipino capital of Manila amidst a brief tour of Asia, and was touted then by the American commander-in-chief as an effort “<em>to make sure international rules and norms are respected</em>,” particularly in an area that's become the scene of international disputes as of late. </p><p> As <a href="http://rt.com/usa/155428-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/" target="_blank">RT reported</a> at the time, officials were unsure at first what facilities would be opened up to the US as part of the agreement. Only now, however, officials for the island nation say the arrangement will ensure that American troops will be able to access at least three local bases during the next decade, including one that Filipino officials say is “<em>ideal</em>.” </p><p> "<em>Right now, the discussions would be ranging from three to five Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) bases</em>," Pio Lorenzo Batino, a defense undersecretary and head of the negotiating panel, told attendees at a news conference on Friday this week, according to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/philippines-u-forces-access-five-military-bases-083805034.html" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. "<em>That's not final</em>." </p><p> The agreement — reached between parties as regional superpower China flexes its military might in the vicinity — will allow the Pentagon to rotate aircraft, ships, equipment and troops in and out of those bases during the next decade. Both the US and Philippines have insisted, however, that the pact is not meant to be seen as an act of aggression towards the Chinese. </p><p> “<em>Our goal is not to counter China. Our goal is not to contain China,”</em> Obama said earlier this week. </p><p> The agreement, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III added then, <em>"takes our security cooperation to a higher level of engagement, reaffirms our countries' commitment to mutual defense and security and promotes regional peace and stability."</em> </p><p> Batino added on Friday this week that a facility that has already been the site of joint exercises between parties, Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, has been recommended to become one of the five bases. The Philippine's <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/57038-philippines-military-bases-edca" target="_blank">Rappler.com</a> news site was quick to acknowledge that Nueve Ecija is just a stone's throw from the disputed Panatag Shoal (Panatag) in the West Philippine Sea, which is currently occupied by the Chinese Coast Guard. </p><p> Another base being considered, Batino told reporters, is one in the city of Subic that was used by Americans until 1991 when lawmakers agreed to evict US forces from the facility. </p><p> Soon, officials are expected to announce which bases will formally be opened up to the US based off of maritime security, maritime domain awareness and humanitarian assistance and disaster response, according to Rappler's report. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156444-afghanistan-landslide-missing-casualties/</guid><title><![CDATA[Some 2,000 missing after landslide in Afghanistan's north-east - officials]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156444-afghanistan-landslide-missing-casualties/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/31/c0/00/afghanistan-landslide-missing-casualties.jpg" title="Image from maps.google"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 15:20:16 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/31/c0/00/afghanistan-landslide-missing-casualties.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Up to 2,000 people are missing after a landslide triggered by heavy rains buried a village in north eastern Afghanistan, officials told AP.

But if Berlin brings about sanctions, won't they simple shoot themselves in the foot?</em> </p><p> <strong>Michael Hudson:</strong> Obviously there are two different views within Germany, because of the close links they don’t want to do anything that is going to disturb the relationship with Russia. But there has been a large confusion over what just NATO is about and about what the German contribution to NATO is about. NATO for the last 30 years has not been about defending Europe. Obviously nobody thinks there is going to be any invasion of Europe from anyone – not from Cuba, Russia or Brazil. The purpose of NATO from the American point of view was burden sharing. Since the 1960s and 1970s military spending has been the single major cause of the US balance and payment deficits. So within Congress and within the Pentagon there was a discussion on how we are going to minimize the balance and payment costs of our military spending in Asia, Europe and the Near East. The answer was burden sharing. And the purpose of involving NATO in Syria, Libya and Iraq, which have nothing to do with North Atlantic at all, is basically to get Germany and France and other European countries to contribute to the American military program. </p><p> This is a tension felt in Germany, France and other countries now, but especially on the German Die Linke party and some of the social democrats who say <em>“Why should we, Europeans, be taxed to pay for the American military program and strategy when we don’t have really any voice in forming it?”</em> They are saying <em>“no taxation without representation”</em> virtually, they are saying <em>“Why should we, Europeans, be taxed for NATO’s tax gathering program.”</em> They fund the American military not only in the Near East but now also adventures in Ukraine that is very much against the European tradition. The European arguments in the press are <em>“We want to support the elected governments”</em> but the Obama Administration says <em>“Well, we’ll redefine democracy. Democracy is not an elected government, it is not an elected government in Libya, in Iraq and Ukraine. Democracy is a country that appoints leaders who the American government will approve off and who will agree to impose neo-liberal policies.”</em> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>White House press secretary Jay Carney admitted that the sanctions will impact the global economy as well as hurt Russia. Only a few years after the global economic crisis, how wise is it to upset the economy again? Won’t it be very harmful for states like Germany that has strong economic ties with Russia?</em> </p><p> <strong>MH:</strong> The Germans are very clear they are not going to pursue sanctions that hurt German industry. That would be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. And there is some discussion in Germany whether they do really want to remain part of NATO. If they don’t really have a voice in it, do they really need to sacrifice German industry so that American industry moves in and takes over the markets that German industry has. This is an American market grabbing opportunity from Germany, and you can be sure that within Merkel’s only Christian-Democratic party there is a big argument over whether Germany should make a sacrifice of its industry for American industry just because America says so. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Will John Kerry's seeming attempt to shift some of the blame for what's happening in Ukraine onto the EU impact the talks?</em> </p><p> <strong>MH:</strong> I don’t think the Europeans pay more attention to John Kerry than the Americans do. He is basically making these speeches for the American electorate, not to the Europeans to pay attention. Kerry is a new sort of Tony Blair. </p><p> He [Kerry] is trying to frame the situation but again, not many people are paying attention. Most people say <em>“What is actually the stake? War is basically financial today?”</em> And you could say <em>“Wars are financed by other means”</em> or <em>“Finances war by other means”</em> and then they realize that all this juggling over Ukraine is basically financial, not only between the West and Russia but between America and Europe. And all this can do is spur a pullback on the part of Europe, saying <em>“Wait a minute, we are pushing for our own interests, not for American national interests.”</em> Again, what it is doing is dividing NATO and making Europeans ask <em>“Is there any real reason for NATO anymore?”</em> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What are the possible consequences of the sanctions against Russia, what do you think?</em> </p><p> <strong>MH:</strong> One consequence will be within Russia itself. It will realize the need that it must be much more self-sufficient and it will have to reduce its dependency on the West and develop much more industrialization. Russia under the World Trade Organization rules is able to sue the US in the International court. And I believe as I have already said that it can soon recover from any damages. And it would be able to recover from these damages by moving against American investments in Russia. So the ramifications could be on America itself. It cannot be good for the foreign investors in Russia, and what Russia can also do is decide to pursue a tax policy that will tax resource rent, mineral rent, land rent and most of the rent that is now being used to generate income, to pay dividends to foreign stockholders. Russia has a very wide range of policies that it can do to resist the sanctions, to be more self-sufficient and basically the effects will not be positive for the US, they will be the exact opposite of what the US is trying to bring about, which is more Russian dependency on the West. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Edward Snowden revealed the US had been spying on Europe, including Merkel herself, for years. In fact, the Chancellor even had her request to see her file rejected. Is she really prepared to sweep this under the carpet, and for what?</em> </p><p> <strong>MH:</strong> Absolutely not. Merkel is from East Germany and they grew up under the Stasi listening to them all the time. And anyone who grew up in East Germany was so traumatized by the tapping of the phones, by the constant surveillance, that this is not something they can get out of the system. All this was sudden, like her eyes were open, saying <em>“The Americans are acting like the new Stasi.”</em> This is everything that she has spent her life fighting against and that was a shock to the system that has led her to doubt in everything the US is doing. She doesn’t want to come out and contradict the President of the United States on her visit here but it makes her very worried about any kind of demands that the US will make on her. And it is beholden on her to back and support German industry and German tax payers against the demands that Obama is making that Germany fund NATO for much more and helping the American producers to outcompete German producers and take the markets away from Germany. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156424-odessa-ukraine-clash-autonomy/</guid><title><![CDATA[3 dead in Ukraine’s Odessa as pro- and anti-Maidan rallies clash]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156424-odessa-ukraine-clash-autonomy/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/30/80/00/odessa-ukraine-clash-autonomy.jpg" title="Image from twitter.com @RT_com"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 13:48:21 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/30/80/00/odessa-ukraine-clash-autonomy.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Three people were killed and 15 wounded as rival rallies clashed in Ukraine's port-city of Odessa.

Do you think the situation requires that?</em> </p><p> <strong>Pepe Escobar:</strong> No, of course not. Flashback, it’s very important. A few days ago John Brennan, head of the CIA, goes to Kiev, they launch an anti-terrorist operation. It’s a huge failure. A few days later US Vice-President Joe Biden goes to Kiev, they launch a second anti-terrorist operation and it’s a huge failure. So this is a third actually, but it is really serious because they’re choking Slavyansk, and in fact that is a key city where protests are really advanced. It is like the People’s republic of Donetsk, there is also the People’s republic of Slavyansk at the moment. It’s a huge provocation and in fact this is concomitant to NATO ratcheting up the pressure, saying that <em>“We won’t go to support Russian aggression.”</em> Russia is waiting to see what is going to happen and the Kremlin has already been very explicit: <em>“If civilian Ukrainians are killed by the Ukrainian army which is a mix of army and Right Sector militia in fact, then the things are going to be spiraling out of control.”</em> And obviously Russia doesn’t want that, but this is what NATO wants and what the Kiev government wants. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>We spoke to one of the Self-Defense Commanders in Slavyansk. He said it was not just the military, but also Right Sector members moving against Slavyansk. How involved do you think radicals are likely to be?</em> </p><p> <strong>PE:</strong> Completely involved because now they are an actual militia. This reminds me a lot of Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria for that matter. Now we are having Ukrainian neo-Nazi, neo-fascist militias fighting for a bunch of regime changers in Kiev and using what is left of the Ukrainian army which is in a pitiful state to attack and encircle a city. Sooner or later they will be attacking civilians. This is completely crazy. Where is the UN in all this? Nowhere to be seen! Nobody is doing anything, and Putin and Merkel talked yesterday and Putin told Merkel explicitly: <em>“Look, if they don’t retreat troops back to Kiev and if they start attacking civilians, then it is a completely different ball game”</em>. Nobody wants this as I said before. NATO needs a reason because the propaganda for the past three weeks has been relentless: Demonization of Russia, demonization of Vladimir Putin and demonization of the pro-Russian militants in the eastern Ukraine. They are not pro-Russian, they want a united Ukraine, a federalized Ukraine, a Finlandized Ukraine that is not allied with the EU and NATO or with Russia, it’s equidistant. And they want more autonomy in the eastern and southern provinces. This is what those <em>“militants”</em> want in fact. And now they are being confronted by guns. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>We've got heavy weaponry on both sides, there are casualties already. How much uglier can we expect this to get?</em> </p><p> <strong>PE:</strong> We should always remember Mao Zedong <em>“A spark is enough to light a prairie fire.”</em> This could be the spark that lights the prairie fire of the civil war in Ukraine where we are going to have face to face, in the worst possible scenario, NATO on one side and the Russian troops on the other. Nobody can possibly want something like this, except of course the people who are doing the best they can to get this outcome: the regime changers in Kiev. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156392-nato-ships-lithuania-drills/</guid><title><![CDATA[NATO ships arrive in Lithuania amid rising tensions over Ukraine]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156392-nato-ships-lithuania-drills/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/2e/80/00/nato-ships-lithuania-drills.jpg" title="Image from wikipedia.org"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 13:14:37 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/2e/80/00/nato-ships-lithuania-drills.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A group of NATO ships has arrived in the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda to “ensure regional security,” the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense has said.

The ships will take part in intensive military drills, stopping off at various ports in the region. They will also participate in operation <em>“Open Sprit”</em> deactivating underwater explosives. </p><p> The Lithuanian Minister of Defense Juozas Olekas said in a statement the drills will <em>“ensure our national and regional security and collective defense.”</em> </p><p> The contingent of ships is not the only NATO force to have been deployed in the region recently. Last week, the United States announced the deployment of 600 soldiers who will participate in military drills in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to show solidarity with NATO members that border Russia. </p><p> In addition, Britain and France have sent 8 fighter jets to Poland and Lithuania to step up aerial patrol in the region. As well as the increased aerial presence, NATO has also deployed ships in the Black Sea, Baltic Sea and East Mediterranean. </p><p> Russia views this recent escalation in NATO forces so close to its border as a provocation and counter-productive in the struggle to de-escalate tensions in Ukraine. On Monday, Russia’s Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu appealed to his American counterpart, Chuck Hagel, to cool down the rhetoric over Ukraine and work together to defuse the situation. </p><p> He denied accusations that Russia was somehow involved in inciting the unrest in eastern Ukraine. As a response to the amassing of NATO troops, Moscow declared it had been forced to begin its own military drills close to the Russian border with Ukraine. </p><p> Hagel has urged NATO’s EU members to increase their defense spending in light of the recent events in Ukraine. </p><p> <em>"We must see renewed financial commitments from all NATO members,"</em> Hagel said in a speech on the NATO alliance to be delivered at the Wilson Center and released by the Defense Department. </p><p> Russia said that the coup-appointed government in Kiev had irreparably severed the peace deal struck on April 17 in Geneva, after it launched a special operation in the Ukrainian city of Slavyansk. </p><p> <em>"While Russia is making efforts to de-escalate and resolve the conflict, the Kiev regime has chosen military aviation strikes on peaceful residential areas and started a punitive operation, literally destroying the last hope for the viability of the Geneva accords,”</em> Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, said in a statement on Friday. </p><p> The Ukrainian army began a special operation against anti-government activists in the eastern town of Slavyansk on Friday morning. The city was blockaded by the Ukrainian military, with helicopters and APCs deployed to crack down on self-defense forces. Moscow has urged an immediate halt to the <em>“punitive operation”</em> and violence on Ukrainian civilians. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156412-brain-memory-research-darpa/</guid><title><![CDATA[DARPA working on brain implants to help restore memory]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156412-brain-memory-research-darpa/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/2f/c0/00/brain-memory-research-darpa.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Mauricio Lima"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 13:14:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/2f/c0/00/brain-memory-research-darpa.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Memory loss could soon be a thing of the past. US military researchers say they’re developing a new brain implant that could restore mental faculties. This could bring a new lease of life to millions around the world, but raises ethical concerns.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/2f/c0/00/brain-memory-research-darpa.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Mauricio Lima" /> <p> The project is being developed by the Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA), and could help soldiers who have suffered brain injuries during service, or millions of sufferers of Alzheimer’s disease. The program is expected to take around four years to complete and is part of a $100 million program by US President Barak Obama to gain a better understanding of the human brain, according to AFP. </p><p> <em>"If you have been injured in the line of duty and you can't remember your family, we want to be able to restore those kinds of functions,"</em> DARPA program manager Justin Sanchez said this week at a conference in Washington DC, convened by the Center for Brain Health at the University of Texas. </p><p> He believes that it is possible to develop prosthetic devices, which can interact with the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a key part of the brain, which is used for the consolidation of information, including the short term and long term memory. </p><p> However, the ability to manipulate the brain does raise ethical questions. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center says, <em>“When you fool around with the brain you are fooling around with personal identity. The cost of altering the mind is you risk losing a sense of self, and that is a new kind of risk we never faced.”</em> </p><p> In theory, the new technology, if and when it is developed, could alter the personality of a human, with Caplan mentioning that it could make soldiers more violent and callous. </p><p> Some progress has already been made on helping to reduce tremors in people who are suffering from Parkinson’s disease and even boosting memory in some patients who have contracted Alzheimer’s. This has been achieved through using a process called deep brain stimulation by sending electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain through a pacemaker. </p><p> Robert Hampson, who is an associate professor at Wake Forrest University, who is not connected to the DARPA project, has already tested some memory techniques on animals. His research on rodents and monkeys has shown that neurons in the hippocampus, which processes memory, fire differently when they see red or blue, or a picture of a face versus a type of food. </p><p> Using prosthetics designed to stimulate the hippocampus, Hampson was able to extend the short-term, working memory of his subjects. But to restore a human's specific memory, the associate professor says scientists would need to know the precise pattern for that memory. </p><p> “<em>The idea is to restore a function back to normal or near normal of the memory processing areas of the brain, so that the person can access their formed memories, and so that they can form new memories as needed,”</em> Hampson concluded. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156396-iraq-death-terrorism-violence/</guid><title><![CDATA[Iraq's April death toll exceeds 1,000 – officials]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156396-iraq-death-terrorism-violence/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/2e/c0/00/iraq-death-terrorism-violence.jpg" title="An Iraqi man inspects destruction in the street following an explosion the previous day in Sadr City, Baghdad's northern Shiite-majority district, on April 11, 2014 (AFP Photo / Ali Al-Saaidi)"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 12:34:27 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/2e/c0/00/iraq-death-terrorism-violence.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The death toll in Iraq shows no signs of decreasing as the country suffered one of its deadliest months in April with 1,009 people killed, according to the country’s Interior Ministry.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/2e/c0/00/iraq-death-terrorism-violence.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="An Iraqi man inspects destruction in the street following an explosion the previous day in Sadr City, Baghdad's northern Shiite-majority district, on April 11, 2014 (AFP Photo / Ali Al-Saaidi)" /> <p> Civilians were the biggest casualties with 881 deaths, while 128 law enforcement members were also killed.

So the Maliki government is in a terrible situation, particularly the people of Iraq are in an awful, traumatic situation,”</em> Chandan said. </p><p> His comments are backed up by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki who has <a href="http://rt.com/news/iraq-saudi-qatar-war-734/" target="_blank">accused</a> Saudi Arabia and Qatar of declaring war on Iraq and supporting global terrorism. The Iraqi leader blamed the two countries for orchestrating the latest wave of bloody violence to hit Iraq this year. </p><p> In a heated attack on Iraq’s Sunni Gulf neighbors, Prime Minister Maliki leveled a number of accusations at Qatar and <a href="http://rt.com/news/156144-saudiarabia-military-exercise-iran/" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia</a> in an interview with France 24. He said both countries are supporting extreme sectarian groups within Iraq, with a view to destabilizing the country and are <em>“attacking”</em> Iraq through Syria. </p><p> </p><p> <em>“I accuse them of inciting and encouraging the terrorist movements. I accuse them of supporting them politically and in the media, of supporting them with money and by buying weapons for them,”</em> Maliki told France 24. </p><p> Attacks have increased in recent weeks, with the first <a href="http://rt.com/op-edge/155932-elections-in-iraq-blasts/" target="_blank">elections</a> since the US withdrawal from the country set to take place. On Monday a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people and wounded at least 50 others at a Kurdish political rally in Khanaqin, 100 miles (140 km) northeast of Baghdad, Reuters reported. </p><p> In the western Mansour district of Baghdad, six police were killed and 16 others were wounded when a suicide attacker dressed as a police officer detonated explosives near the entrance of a school used as a polling station, according to police and medical sources. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/156404-usa-russia-new-cold-war/</guid><title><![CDATA['Cold War Against Russia — Without Debate']]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/156404-usa-russia-new-cold-war/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/2f/40/00/usa-russia-new-cold-war.jpg" title="Russia’s President Vladimir Putin (L) and US President Barack Obama (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 11:45:12 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/2f/40/00/usa-russia-new-cold-war.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Future historians will note that in April 2014, nearly a quarter-century after the end of the Soviet Union, the White House declared a new Cold War on Russia.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/2f/40/00/usa-russia-new-cold-war.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russia’s President Vladimir Putin (L) and US President Barack Obama (AFP Photo)" /> <p> And that, in a grave failure of representative democracy, there was scarcely a public word of debate, much less opposition, from the American political or media establishment. </p><p> The Obama administration announced its Cold War indirectly, in a front-page New York Times story by Peter Baker on April 20. According to the report, President Obama has resolved, because of the Ukraine crisis, that he can <em>“never have a constructive relationship”</em> with Russian President Vladimir Putin and will instead <em>“ignore the master of the Kremlin”</em> and focus on <em>“isolating…Russia by cutting off its economic and political ties to the outside world…effectively making it a pariah state.”</em> In short, Baker reports, the White House has adopted <em>“an updated version of the Cold War strategy of containment.”</em> He might have added, a very extreme version. The report has been neither denied nor qualified by the White House. </p><p> No modern precedent exists for the shameful complicity of the American political-media elite at this fateful turning point. Considerable congressional and mainstream media debate, even protest, were voiced, for example, during the run-up to the US wars in Vietnam and Iraq and, more recently, proposed wars against Iran and Syria. This Cold War—its epicenter on Russia’s borders; undertaken amid inflammatory American, Russian and Ukrainian media misinformation; and unfolding without the stabilizing practices that prevented disasters during the preceding Cold War—may be even more perilous. It will almost certainly result in a new nuclear arms race, a prospect made worse by Obama’s provocative public assertion that <em>“our conventional forces are significantly superior to the Russians’,”</em> and possibly an actual war with Russia triggered by Ukraine’s looming civil war. (NATO and Russian forces are already mobilizing on the country’s western and eastern borders, while the US-backed Kiev government is warning of a <em>“third world war.”</em>) </p><p> </p><p> And yet, all this has come with the virtually unanimous, bipartisan support, or indifference, of the US political establishment, from left to right, Democrats and Republicans, progressives (whose domestic programs will be gravely endangered) and conservatives. It has also been supported by mainstream media that shape and reflect policy-making opinion, from the Times and The Washington Post to The Wall Street Journal, from The New Republic to The Weekly Standard, from MSNBC to Fox News, from NPR to commercial radio news. (There are notable exceptions, including this magazine, but none close enough to the mainstream to be <em>“authoritative” i</em>nside the Beltway.) </p><p> To be more specific, not one of the 535 members of Congress has publicly expressed doubts about the White House’s new <em>“Cold War strategy of containment.”</em> Nor have any of the former US presidents or presidential candidates who once advocated partnership with post-Soviet Russia. Before the Ukraine crisis deepened, a handful of unofficial dissenters did appear on mainstream television, radio and op-ed pages, but so few and fleetingly they seemed to be heretics awaiting banishment. Their voices have since been muted by legions of cold warriors. </p><p> Both sides in the confrontation, the West and Russia, have legitimate grievances. Does this mean, however, that the American establishment’s account of recent events should not be questioned? That it was imposed on the West by Putin’s <em>“aggression,”</em> and this because of his desire <em>“to re-create as much of the old Soviet empire as he can</em>” or merely to <em>“maintain Putin’s domestic rating.”</em> Does it mean there is nothing credible enough to discuss in Moscow’s side of the story? That twenty years of NATO’s eastward expansion has caused Russia to feel cornered. That the Ukraine crisis was instigated by the West’s attempt, last November, to smuggle the former Soviet republic into NATO. That the West’s jettisoning in February of its own agreement with then-President Viktor Yanukovych brought to power in Kiev an unelected regime so anti-Russian and so uncritically embraced by Washington that the Kremlin felt an urgent need to annex predominantly Russian Crimea, the home of its most cherished naval base. And, most recently, that Kiev’s sending of military units to suppress protests in pro-Russian eastern Ukraine is itself a violation of the April 17 agreement to de-escalate the crisis. </p><p> Future historians will certainly find some merit in Moscow’s arguments, and wonder why they are being widely debated in, for example, Germany, but not in America. It may already be too late for the democratic debate the US elite owes our nation. If so, the costs to American democracy are already clear. </p><p style="text-align: right;"> <em>Katrina vanden Heuvel and Stephen F.

However, the IMF also demands huge economic reforms in return. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Ukraine is certainly in need of money. So what's wrong with getting help from the IMF then?</em> </p><p> <strong>Ben Aris:</strong> It’s in desperate need of money. The country is virtually bankrupt, it is living from hand to mouth, running on fumes, and the IMF has stepped in with a program that should be over two years, so they are looking for some $17 billion this year. However, it comes with strings attached and there lies a problem. The balls are now very firmly into the government’s court and they need to come up with a reform program because when all is said and done they can’t buy their way out of crisis, they need to fix the economy and that money is just a sort of plaster to hold it together while they are getting on with that work. That is going to be extremely difficult, it’s hard to express just how sick the Ukrainian economy is; it is one of only two countries in the whole fifteen republics of the former Soviet Union that has yet to reach its 1991 level. So they have everything to do before them and of course doing that in a very tense and unstable political situation. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The IMF claims the economic reforms will take care of the most vulnerable there, but what actually can they do for people in reality?</em> </p><p> <strong>BA:</strong> It’s about putting the economy back on to a stable footing and that means getting control of deficits - the current account deficit is very high, the budget deficit is very high, the economy itself is in a free fall, the government is saying it is going to contract by 3 percent, the program announced today actually assumes 5 percent and the analysts are saying that the contraction could be as severe as 10 percent. This is an economy caving in on itself. And in order to do that they are going to have to introduce some very harsh austerity. By that I mean they are going to cut the public sector, they are going to cut wages, they are going to cut what they call an overly generous pension, and at the same time they are going to have to raise taxes. So the poor Ukrainian people, rather than being bailed out by the IMF, are going to be face the sort of austerity that the populations of Greece and Cyprus have seen, if not even more harsh, even more difficult to pay, and that of course will cause problems. The promises that have been made by the EU association and IMF bailout have led people to believe that once the rest comes to help, then everything is going to get better, and actually in the short term it’s going to get a lot worse for the average person. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Meanwhile, Transparency International ranks Ukraine as a highly corrupt country. Is the IMF worried about what might happen to their cash do you think?</em> </p><p> <strong>BA:</strong> This is actually one of the core problems. The corruption is a function of the fact that in the last 10 years no government, neither Blue, nor Orange, has actually attempted to even begin the process of building up new institutions of the functioning government. So the first thing the government is going to have to do is try to put all of these pieces together to build the machinery of normal government, and that is going to be very difficult. Part and parcel of that is stamping out corruption. Transparency called it the most corrupt country in eastern Europe and it has similar problems with press freedom, human rights… it has the whole gamut of issues to deal with. Just now we are turning to the work of rebuilding the country, whereas most of the countries of the region have been at it for the 10 years. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Where does this leave Moscow? Will it help in the future if things go really bad?</em> </p><p> <strong>BA:</strong> One of the ironies is that the first tranche is going to be delivered immediately… $3 billion… a large part of that is going to end up in Russia’s coffers to pay for gas and bond payments. At the end of the day, some of the people in Ukraine have intimated that to rescue Ukraine is impossible without cooperation and partnership with Russia. Russia remains a key trading partner, it also heavily invested into the economy, it banks there and main crediting organizations are actually still functioning and for Ukraine to prosper and become healthy again, it’s inconceivable that they can do it without Russia. At the same time we have the European association agreement, but EU membership is not on the table, and EU membership would come with all the structural reforms that it desperately needs. The Ukrainian economy is actually dragging the Russian economy down and so it’s in Russian interests to see something done. But obviously where we stand for the moment, we have a long way from having a three-way conversation between the EU, Kiev and Moscow. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/156376-russia-bahrain-investment-deal-usa/</guid><title><![CDATA[‘US in panic because of its waning power’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/156376-russia-bahrain-investment-deal-usa/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/2d/80/00/russia-bahrain-investment-deal-usa.jpg" title="Russia's President Vladimir Putin (3rd R) meets Bahrain's Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa (2nd L) in the Kremlin in Moscow, on April 30, 2014 (AFP Photo)"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 10:51:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/2d/80/00/russia-bahrain-investment-deal-usa.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Political and economic power is draining away from the US, while other states make bilateral agreements like the investment deal between Bahrain and Russia, which makes the US extremely worried, Professor of Binary Economics Rodney Shakespeare told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/2d/80/00/russia-bahrain-investment-deal-usa.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russia's President Vladimir Putin (3rd R) meets Bahrain's Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa (2nd L) in the Kremlin in Moscow, on April 30, 2014 (AFP Photo)" /> <p> The US has sent a message of discontent to its ally Bahrain, which signed an investment deal with Russia. Washington has said that it is concerned with the Gulf state cozying up to Russia, which is currently under sanctions due to the Ukrainian crisis. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Washington and Bahrain have long been close on political and economic terms. Why would the Gulf state cross its Western ally in the first place?</em> </p><p> <strong>Rodney Shakespeare:</strong> Because economic power is going away from the West and it is going away from the US. Political power is moving away and the US has lost the vestiges, if it ever had it at all, of moral authority. So you have a situation at the moment where the US is still in the Cold War mindset, and thinking it has got political, economic power, moral authority... It thinks that it can tell Russia what to do, but the times are changing. And is hubristically thinking that it could sanction Russia, particularly when everybody knows that it’s really about NATO wanting to put missiles into Ukraine and that’s what really is going on; the US is making a big mistake. All it is going to do is to increase the desire of others to make agreements. </p><p> Bahrain is the most insalubrious and vicious regime, but even Bahrain can see that American power is waning. Of course, Russia would take this opportunity very reasonably to link up with Bahrain and effectively give a <em>‘V’</em> sign to the Americans. This event between two investment institutions in Russia and Bahrain is highly significant; it is something that shows you that Western and American power is declining, others are making new agreements. And frankly, the Americans are going to lose in this situation and eventually the dollar will collapse as these agreements increase. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>All this comes just a day after President Putin said Russia could reconsider Western investment in its energy sector. This threat now looks more serious, doesn't it?</em> </p><p> <strong>RS:</strong> Russia has huge natural resources, it’s a vast country, and has a highly advanced population. The bottom line in all this: it’s not Standard &amp; Poor’s saying they are going to downgrade bonds for Russia. The physical realities are that Russia will survive and will be making more agreements and behind all this is the ultimate weakness of the dollar. It really doesn’t matter what happens now but the thing goes on and will end up more and more to the advantage of Russia and other countries, which refuse to be bullied by the US. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>While it's worth 10 billion dollars, that's not exactly a record breaker when it comes to investment. So why is Washington getting so worried about it?</em> </p><p> <strong>RS:</strong> This is symbolic. Bahrain is in the Persian Gulf and it is where the American fleet by which America supports Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates. Those countries, of course, ultimately support the expansion of Zionist Israel which is what it is about. But as soon as Bahrain, the center of naval power of the US, makes an agreement with Russia, America is panicking, they are realizing that this is a sign of the times and after all the bluster of the Americans, people are just going to go and make their own way, and the more Americans try to sanction, the more they are going to make agreements like this. So America is panicking because they recognize that their power is on the wane and this symbolizes that waning power. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>With the West constantly stepping up the sanctions rhetoric and new players now apparently emerging in the game, could we see a re-drawing of the geo-political map here?</em> </p><p> <strong>RS:</strong> Yes. American power still amounts to some military power, its spying power and others haven’t quite organized themselves. The BRIC countries, for example, haven’t quite established a new internet repayment system and they haven’t quite established their equivalent to the IMF. To some extent the whole situation is premature, and then of course other countries have to find agreements among themselves, not economic, but political. In a very fundamental way, the bullying of the West is going to come to an end at some stage; that is going to be a very dangerous period because the Americans have got military power. But you are starting to see re-alignments… they have been going on for quite a time, and the effects of sanctioning Russia means that they are not going to have it, they are going to go off and make agreements. I tell you, we want sanctions on Israel and at one stage we are going to have sanctions on the US because that’s what is going to happen if America continues as it is, because everybody has got fed up with them. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156316-merkel-obama-russia-sanctions/</guid><title><![CDATA[Russian sanctions, NSA spying top the agenda at Merkel’s White House visit]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156316-merkel-obama-russia-sanctions/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/29/c0/00/merkel-obama-russia-sanctions.jpg" title="U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (Reuters / Grigory Dukor)"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 10:34:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/29/c0/00/merkel-obama-russia-sanctions.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Germany’s Chancellor Merkel is in the White House for the first time since it was revealed the NSA monitored her personal communications.

Furthermore, Germany is still reeling from the NSA spy revelations that affected millions of German citizens, as well as high-ranking businessmen and politicians. </p><p> Merkel reiterated earlier this week that Germany would support any further financial sanctions against Russia. However, growing calls from the German business sector may force her to change her policy in Friday’s meeting. </p><p> <em>“The Germans are very clear they are not going to pursue factions that hurt German industry. That would be the straw that broke the camel’s back,”</em> said Michael Hudson professor of Economics at the University of Missouri to RT. </p><p> Indeed, some major corporate figures have already spoken out against a potential escalation of the sanctions, maintaining they will do more harm than good to the German economy. </p><p> <em>“If there's a single message we have as business leaders, then it's this: sit down at the negotiating table and resolve these matters peacefully,”</em> Eckhard Cordes told a recent conference in Berlin. Cordes is a former Daimler AG executive who now heads the Ostauschuss, German industry's branch for Eastern Europe, reported the Wall Street Journal. </p><p> So far the US, EU, Canada and Japan have imposed sanction on Russia for its alleged role in the unrest in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has denied claims it is involved in the unrest and has pointed the finger at Washington for orchestrating the situation in Ukraine as part of its geopolitical strategy in the region. </p><h2> NSA spying </h2><p> The espionage antics of the US National Security Agency remain a bone of contention between Berlin and Washington. It emerged earlier in April that Merkel had been denied access to her NSA file, following reports the agency had monitored her personal communications. The revelations had a profound effect on German society, prompting calls for Washington to account for its actions. </p><p> <em>“First the US denied spying on Merkel’s cell phone, then admitted it, now it just continues, because Obama says ‘we reserve the right to collect information.’ I just see Angela Merkel going to the US to pick up new instructions,”</em> Ken Jebson, Redaktion radio host told RT’s Peter Oliver. </p><p> While WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafsson, said the German government’s lack of resolve over the NSA spy scandal is indicative of European cowardice in the face of US dominance. </p><p> <em>“I think the proof of the cowardice of governments and politicians and their unwillingness to tackle this in a meaningful way, despite what they say publicly, was when European countries closed their airspace and forced the presidential plane of Evo Morales to land in Austria, on a hunch that Edward Snowden was on board,”</em> he told RT. </p><p> Earlier this year Washington pledged that it would no longer spy on world leaders, but stated it would still gather information on the intentions of foreign powers through its espionage programs. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156372-ukraine-helicopter-down-pilot/</guid><title><![CDATA[At least two Ukrainian army helicopters shot down over Slavyansk (VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156372-ukraine-helicopter-down-pilot/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/2d/40/00/ukraine-helicopter-down-pilot.jpg" title="Still from YouTube video uploaded by user Андрей Петров"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 09:57:15 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/2d/40/00/ukraine-helicopter-down-pilot.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Self-defense squads have reportedly taken down at least two Ukrainian army helicopters, with one pilot confirmed dead.

So I think it was very irresponsible what the EU did; they should have kept out of it,”</em> Wilders said. </p><p> The leader of the <a href="http://rt.com/news/dutch-acquitted-charges-wilders/" target="_blank">right-wing</a> Party for Freedom criticized politicians from Europe, the US and from his home country for appearing in Kiev and giving the impression that Ukraine had the complete support of the West while completely ignoring the fact that Ukraine remains a very complex situation. </p><p> <em>“I believe Europe was more thinking about itself and expanding it and its territory than really thinking about the whole of Ukraine, let alone the stability in that region.”</em> </p><p> Wilders admits he understands the gripes of those living in the east of the country, who were unhappy when the coup-appointed government took power in Kiev. <em>“The best thing to do is to de-escalate by taking the Russian minority in eastern Ukraine seriously; give them rights and make them really feel as important as the other half of Ukraine,”</em> the 50 year-old Eurosceptic continued. </p><p> </p><p> The Dutch politician says Russia is also partly to blame and that retaining the territorial integrity of Ukraine is of the utmost importance. </p><p> <em>“I’m not only blaming the EU, I’m blaming both Russia and the EU. But I have to be honest, the European Union made a terrible move in the beginning of November last year, and they at least partially started a lot of the troubles, and that analysis is shared by more parties in the EU for sure,”</em> said the leader of the Party for Freedom. </p><p> The US and the EU recently introduced more economic sanctions against Russia as they believe the country is having a destabilizing effect on Ukraine. However, Wilders says this will help neither the Russians nor the EU and cannot have a <em>“positive effect.”</em> </p><p> Wilders has achieved success in his native Netherlands on a ticket of <a href="http://rt.com/news/netherlands-government-euro-clark-908/" target="_blank">euro skepticism</a> and is adamant that his country should leave the EU. <em>“We can deal better economically when we are in charge of our country, again, when it comes to national sovereignty – so, yes, we would like to leave the EU and be stronger as a national country,”</em> the Dutchman said. </p><p> Wilders cites the example of Switzerland, as a model that his country could follow, with the Alpine nation being one of the richest on the continent, despite never having joined the EU. </p><p> <em>“We lost our identity; we lost our national sovereignty to the EU, an institution that really a lot of people in the West don’t like so much anymore. I have nothing against Europe, but I have a lot against the EU as an organization,”</em> Wilders concluded. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156352-kremlin-ukraine-operation-punitive/</guid><title><![CDATA[Kiev’s ‘punitive op’ in E.

He gave a reminder that Putin had earlier described the possibility of any such operation as a “<em>criminal action.</em>” </p><p> “<em>Unfortunately, the latest developments prove the assessment was right,</em>” Peskov said. </p><p> Later, speaking on Rossiya-24 TV, Putin’s spokesman said Moscow was waiting for Western countries to react to the military operation in Slavyansk. </p><p> “<em>We are calling on the European capitals, the United States of America to give an assessment of the current events and are of course calling on those carrying out airstrikes on residential areas to change their mind</em>.” </p><p> Russia’s Foreign Ministry demanded Ukraine “<em>to immediately end the punitive operation and any violence against its own people, to release political prisoners and to ensure journalists can carry out their work freely</em>.” The Ministry’s statement, released on Friday, also urges foreign countries to refrain from interfering in events in Ukraine. </p><p> Putin’s special representative, Vladimir Lukin, was earlier sent to eastern Ukraine to help conduct negotiations on the release of the foreign observers held hostage by anti-government protesters. </p><p> “<em>Following the start of the punitive operation, the Russian side has lost all contact with Lukin</em>,” Putin’s spokesman said. </p><p> RIA Novosti later managed to get through to Lukin’s assistant Natalia Mirze, who reassured that everything was fine with the special representative. </p><p> Peskov said Kremlin was also “<em>extremely worried</em>” by the fact that Russian and foreign journalists were in the “<em>zone of the punitive operation.</em>” </p><p> "<em>We, of course, demand measures to be taken for ensuring their security,</em>” Peskov added. </p><p> Online media outlet, Donbass News, has announced that contact was lost with SkyNews and CBS crew, working in eastern Ukraine. The news website has given the names of the currently missing journalists: Clarissa Ward, Erin Lyall, Andy Srevenson and Geoff Mabberley. </p><p> Also on Friday, there was news of contact being lost with a Buzzfeed journalist, Mike Giglio and his interpreter. One of the messages from Giglio read, “<em>We were captured at the checkpoint</em>.” Later, Donbass News reported that Giglio and his interpreter were freed. </p><p> The Ukrainian army <a href="http://rt.com/news/156292-slavyansk-army-special-operation/" target="_blank">began</a> a special operation against anti-government activists in the eastern town of Slavyansk on Friday morning. The city was blockaded by the Ukrainian military, with 20 helicopters reportedly deployed to crack down on self-defense forces. </p><p> The military operation has resulted in three casualties. Two Ukrainian pilots died, after their helicopters were shot down, according to the Defense Ministry. </p><p> The self-defense forces in Slavyansk say one of their members has been killed. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156348-syria-bombing-alqaeda-deaths/</guid><title><![CDATA[18 including 11 kids, killed in double car bombing in central Syria – State TV]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156348-syria-bombing-alqaeda-deaths/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/2b/c0/00/syria.jpg" title="Image from google.maps"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 08:10:13 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/2b/c0/00/syria.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Two car bombs ripped through a town in Syria’s central province of Hama, killing 18 people and injuring over 50, State TV said.

The TV blamed “terrorists” for the attack, though it is not clear if the two blasts were connected. </p><p> Rami Abdurrahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the group's activists counted at least 15 dead from the blasts, including at least eight civilians. </p><p> Abdurrahman said he was not aware so far of any children being killed in the two attacks but conflicting death tolls are common after large bombings. </p><p> The country has experienced a wave of violence in recent weeks, with more than <a href="http://rt.com/news/155560-damascus-blast-killed-syria/" target="_blank">50 people</a> dying in separate car bomb attacks on Tuesday. 37 people were killed in Homs, which has been a flashpoint since the civil conflict began over three years ago. </p><p> The attack was carried out in an area inhabited by Alawites, which is a minority Shiite group, to whom President Bashar Assad also belongs. </p><p> Car bombs have been a favored by Al-Qaeda affiliated groups operating in the country, who are looking to oust the Syrian president. </p><p> Attacks are intensifying in the country on the eve of elections. The incumbent president, Bashar Assad put himself up for re-election on Monday, along with ten other candidates. Assad has been in power since 2000 and won the last ballot in 2007, gaining 97 percent of the vote. </p><p> According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which uses information from local sources, at least 150,000 people have died since the conflict began in March 2011. The United Nations says that nine million people, which is around half the country’s population are in need of humanitarian assistance. The international organization also states that six million have been forced to flee their homes, while 2.5 million have already fled Syria into neighboring countries. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156336-south-korea-train-collision/</guid><title><![CDATA[Over 170 injured as two trains collide in Seoul subway – reports]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156336-south-korea-train-collision/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/2b/00/00/south-korea-train-collision-.jpg" title=" South Korean railway workers inspect two damaged trains after they collided at Sangwangsimni station in Seoul on May 2, 2014 (AFP Photo / Jung Yeon-Je)"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 07:32:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/2b/00/00/south-korea-train-collision-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />More than 170 people were injured as two trains collided in the South Korean capital’s subway, Yonhap news agency reports citing firefighters.

It will damage the political process and hinder the prospects for peace. This is how Western leaders – their regional allies and also UN bigwigs – have dismissed the presidential elections in Syria set for June 3.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/12/40/00/presidential-elections-in-syria.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Supporters of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad take part in a rally showing support a day after he declared that he would seek re-election in June, in Aleppo April 29, 2014. (Reuters)" /> <p> It seems that despite having a choice of several candidates, the Syrian people having an election to decide for themselves who should be their country's president is a <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/157526/ban-kimoon-%E2%80%98syrian-elections-will-hamper-the-prospects-for-political-solution" target="_blank">very bad thing</a>. In the name of 'democracy', elections in Syria should only happen after the current government has been forcibly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-27100821" target="_blank">removed</a> from power. 'Assad must go', even if it could well be the case that the majority of Syrians don't want him to go. </p><p> The Western elite's dismissive response to these elections tells us everything we need to know about their commitment to “democracy”. </p><p> The truth is that the emergence of a multi-party democracy in Syria enabled by the country's 2012 constitution, which ended the decades’ long monopoly on power by the Ba'ath Party, is the very last thing the US and its allies want; they know that the Baathists and President Assad have too much popular support in the country. By continually repeating “Assad must go” before any new presidential elections are held, these “democrats” are effectively disenfranchising a large chunk of Syrian society – the people who do support their government. We should not be surprised at this as these Western “democrats” routinely seek to disenfranchise those who have the “wrong” views. </p><p> Pro-government Syrians in 2014 are in the same position as pro-government Belarusians and pro-government Venezuelans. They support the “wrong” side so their views are discounted. In these countries, and indeed in any countries where there is a government of which the Western political and financial elites disapprove, only the views of the opposition counts. They should take power and rule even though, as in the case of the current Western-backed junta in Kiev, it is clear to any objective observer that they do not have majority support. Yet despite their lack of majority support, pro-Western groupings are automatically referred to as “democratic forces,” to contrast them with the “undemocratic forces” that most people do support. It really is beyond Orwellian. </p><p> Any election which doesn't go the way the Western elites want, or is unlikely to go the way they want is automatically labeled a “sham” or a “mockery of democracy,” even before it is held. This is in order to de-legitimize the victor. We saw a classic example of that with the Iranian presidential elections in 2009. No credible evidence was ever put forward to show that the poll was fixed, or that there was widespread fraud that made a difference to the result. Yet because a candidate the Western elites disapproved of won, the result was held to be a “sham”, with establishment commentators routinely referring to Ahmadinejad's “stolen election.” </p><p> We can say as a general rule that no-one who the West deplors is ever allowed to win an election fairly. If they win it has to be by cheating. There are always slurs against the leader in question. Hugo Chavez' rule in Venezuela was endorsed by a succession of popular votes, yet he was still labeled a “dictator” by Western neocons and the fake-left, with his death from cancer in 2013 openly cheered by some Western “democrats”. </p><p> In Yugoslavia, in the 1990s, Slobodan Milosevic and the Socialist Party won regular election victories in a country where many opposition parties freely existed and operated, yet Milosevic too was routinely referred to as a “dictator”. A similar fate befell Viktor Yanukovich, the recently ousted president of Ukraine who had come to power in free elections in 2010 in a country where new presidential elections were due in 2015. No truthful, objective observer could conclude that Chavez, Milosevic or Yanukovich were “dictators”, yet the men were labeled as such simply because they did not do what Western elites wanted. </p><h2> Desires and methods of anti-democratic democrats </h2><p> Of course, the first aim of the anti-democratic democrats is to try and make sure that the “wrong” leader does not get into power in the first place. The US' multi-billion dollar “democracy promotion” industry is designed so that the “wrong” candidates do not win, or not very often. </p><p> The first post WWII election in Europe “fixed” by the newly-formed CIA was in Italy in 1948, where the US feared a communist victory. Up to $3 million was secretly channeled to anti-communist parties. “On April 18, the Christian Democrats won a landslide victory. As the Christian Democrats congratulated themselves and the Communists wept bitter tears of defeat, the CIA reflected on the success of its campaign of covert intervention in Italian affairs. This was a lesson not lost on the future developments of CIA activities elsewhere,” wrote Jeremy Isaacs and Taylor Downing in their book, ‘Cold War’. </p><p> Since Italy in 1948, the US has, in the name of “democracy”, intervened in scores of elections around the world, to try to get the result they desire. </p><p> </p><p> If they do not manage to fix the result, through bankrolling their preferred parties, Otpor style “youth movements” and other measures, they still have recourse to yet more options to ditch unwelcome governments. They can organize a coup, as they did, for instance in Guatemala in 1954, where CIA-trained “rebels” toppled the democratically elected leader, Jacobo Abrenz, whose government had committed the “crime” of nationalizing uncultivated land owned by America's powerful United Fruit Company, which had friends in high places in Washington. </p><p> The US and its allies can “punish” the country and its people and try to weaken its economy through the imposition of sanctions, as they did with Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Palestine in 2006 (after the election victory of Hamas), and are doing to Iran, Belarus and Russia today, citing a variety of bogus reasons for their imposition. And they can fall back on trying to destabilize the country in question and its government through the funding of violent street protests, as we have seen in 2014 in Ukraine and Venezuela. That presents the “targeted” government with a dilemma: do they use force to deal with the protests and risk being labeled “genocidal” with sanctions being imposed and the leader called a “war criminal” by Western politicians and their media marionettes, or do they sit back and allow Western-financed “protestors” take over, even though it is the government and not the protestors who have the democratic mandate? </p><p> All this is done in the name of democracy, but it is important to realize that it is really about destroying democracy. It is about ensuring that only governments which serve the interests of Western elites and their Middle East allies can come to power, or are allowed to stay in power. The people's will to elect the governments of their choice is respected, but only if they choose a government Western elites approve of. </p><p> Their haughty dismissal of elections in Syria, their support for a violent coup against a democratically elected government in Ukraine, their ongoing destabilization of the democratically elected government in Venezuela, and their attempts to fix elections around the globe, together with their strong support for some of the most undemocratic regimes on earth, like Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies, proves that the Western elites are actually working against democracy, not for it. </p><p> It's also revealing to compare the West's reaction to Syria's elections and recent democratic reforms there, with the support for Egypt's planned presidential elections despite the undemocratic crackdown there on the now banned main opposition grouping, The Muslim Brotherhood, and the handing out of mass death sentences earlier this week. While the democratizing 2012 Syrian constitution is beyond the pale for Western leaders, according to US Secretary of State John Kerry, Egypt's new constitution, is a “positive step forward.” </p><p> The double standards should not surprise us because the country that is pushing most aggressively for “democracy” around the world, i.e. the US, is itself not a democracy, but an oligarchy, as a new study has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10769041/The-US-is-an-oligarchy-study-concludes.html" target="_blank">concluded</a>. American governments as evidenced by the illegal invasion of Iraq, their backing of violent “rebels” in Syria and the current attempt to provoke a new cold war with Russia over Ukraine, act not in the interest of ordinary Americans, but in the interests of Wall Street, the military industrial complex and powerful foreign lobbies. In the end the American people, who pay for the wars and a serial regime-changing foreign policy that only benefits the 1 percent, are as much a victim of anti-democratic democrats as citizens of other countries. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/156280-east-ukraine-civil-war/</guid><title><![CDATA[Protesters in eastern Ukraine see Kiev govt as a ‘gang of oligarchs’]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/156280-east-ukraine-civil-war/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/27/80/00/ukraine-army-2.jpg" title="AFP Photo / VAasily Maximov"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 04:32:37 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/27/80/00/ukraine-army-2.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Ukrainian government in Kiev has lost control of vast parts of its own country, with the east moving further and further apart, investigative journalist Manuel Ochsenreiter told RT, warning that a real civil war is possible.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/27/80/00/ukraine-army-2.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / VAasily Maximov" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>We’ve heard repeated calls from Russia and the West for there to be nationwide dialogue from Kiev, but given what has happened today, another administrative building has been taken over by protesters, how likely do you think it is that protesters will actually be willing to negotiate or talk?</em> </p><p> <strong>Manuel Ochsenreiter:</strong> It’s very much unlikely that the protesters in eastern and southern Ukraine would talk on the same level with the putsch government in Kiev, because we have to realize that in the eyes of those protesters, the government in Kiev is a sort of gang of oligarchs, of organized crime, of terrorists, and of course hooligans, and when we see who is right now governing in Kiev, they are not so wrong. So who can expect or who can blame those people that they are not willing to talk with that government and that they want to take the fate of their people, the self determination of the Russians there, to take it in their own hands. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>So do we have a stalemate here? How do you see things playing out?</em> </p><p> <strong>MO:</strong> We see now the violence has become more, but we also saw that the Kiev government doesn’t have control of its own country. The Ukrainian state, what we saw now on the map, when we put the map on the table, is not existing anymore; it is a failed state, an empty entity, which is in the west governed by a putsch gang of people who were imposed by the West, by NATO, as well as the European Union. Not with the support of their people but with the support of foreign powers, with the support of the West, while the people in the east and in the south are spreading away from Kiev and they want to merge with Russia in any form. So if there is no opportunity for that, that both parts of Ukraine can talk with each other and that they will find a solution that pleases both sides, there will be much more violence and it can be very likely that a real civil war might break out. And this would not be not a civil war like in Syria, far away from Europe. This would be a civil war inside Europe. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>The protesters in east Ukraine are saying they want to hold a referendum. They want to do it before the election at the end of this month. Presumably, this is not advisable. How do you see best to deal with this issue of the referendum?</em> </p><p> <strong>MO:</strong> When you ask me if this is advisable, it depends on who you ask. First of all, it is not the West, it is not Brussels, and it is not Washington. It is not Berlin, it is not Paris, and it is not London, who decides what is advisable for the eastern Ukrainians. If they want to hold a referendum and they want to give themselves a decision where to go, the fate of the future, they should do that. It is always the wrong image that we have that people should ask in Washington or in Brussels if they are allowed to do a thing like a referendum. We had that already with Crimea, when the West was protesting, but thank God we have to say that we enter now a new period of history, where a geopolitical earthquake takes place and we see that we don’t have anymore the situation that the term “international community” is a camouflage word for the West. The international community means there are multiple levels; there are a lot of states. And of course, if they want to do a referendum and they want to do a decision, it is also important what Moscow says...it is important what China says, what the BRICS states are saying. It is not just anymore important what NATO is saying and what Washington is saying. And that is why this is a very good development. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>But there is a big difference between the referendum that took place in Crimea, and just geographically speaking, the one that will take place in eastern Ukraine. There are two very different problems, but presumably the one in east Ukraine could be a lot worse in terms of what could happen, what the consequences could be.</em> </p><p> <strong>MO:</strong> Absolutely. The situation of the referendum is very much different. In Crimea it was very calm, almost like a typical election day somewhere in a little sleepy European city. But what we expect now, of course, in eastern Ukraine is something else. And we will see there a lot of violence, we will see there maybe bomb attacks. We know that there are terrorists working for the Kiev government. I mean we have the Right Sector group, which is nothing else than a hooligan and a terrorist group. There are people of the Right Sector fighting with Chechnya’s Islamists against Russia. They were fighting in the Georgian war in 2008. So we have to expect of course when we look at the borderline that it is very easy to infiltrate eastern Ukraine. Much more easy to infiltrate eastern Ukraine from Kiev than it was to infiltrate, for example, Crimea. Of course the situation is different, but at the end of the day it is still a referendum. And maybe somebody can tell me a more basic democratic act than a referendum, when the people have the right to show their voice for what they want to do in the future. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Just last night, we saw military drills taking place in Kiev. The Kiev authorities deny they had anything to do with this. What is your interpretation of what went on?</em> </p><p> <strong>MO:</strong> The Kiev government, if we can call that a government, they have two problems. Problem number one: they lost complete control of vast areas of their own country, what I said [before], that the country just exists on the map. And on the other side, they are working with many dirty tricks because they desperately want to have military and economic support of the West, mainly NATO and the EU. For any provocation they do, they want to provoke the Russians to show military action. We know that Poland is very much putting fuel into that fire, the Baltic states as well. They are already promising Ukraine their support. So there is something going on and of course the Kiev government is desperately trying to get that support. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156268-ukraine-brings-back-conscription/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukraine brings back conscription amid unrest in country's east]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156268-ukraine-brings-back-conscription/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/26/c0/00/ukraine-army.jpg" title="RIA Novosti / Mikhail Voskresenskiy"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 00:15:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/26/c0/00/ukraine-army.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ukraine's acting President Aleksandr Turchinov has announced he is reinstating a military draft to help deal with the “deteriorating” situation in the country's east and south.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/26/c0/00/ukraine-army.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="RIA Novosti / Mikhail Voskresenskiy" /> <p> The draft will call on all males between 18 and 25 years of age, who are not eligible for an exemption. </p><p> Turchinov's office said in a statement on Thursday that the decision was made <em>"given the deteriorating situation in the east and the south...the rising force of armed pro-Russian units and the taking of public administration buildings...which threaten territorial integrity.”</em> </p><p> The military draft will be carried out in May-July, but no details were given as to where the new conscripts will be deployed. </p><p> Last year, Ukraine announced plans to stop the draft in 2014 and begin the transfer to a professional army. However, Turchinov said he decided to change the existing law due to <em>“threats of encroachment on Ukraine’s territorial integrity.”</em> </p><p> On Wednesday, Turchinov said the government in Kiev <a href="http://rt.com/news/155856-ukraine-alert-president-army/" target="_blank">cannot control</a> the situation in the east of the country and that Ukraine’s army is on full alert due to the <em>“threat of a Russian invasion.”</em> </p><p> <em>“I am going back to the real threat that Russia would unleash a continental war against Ukraine.

Yet the potential hazards might be as worrisome as the benefits. </p><p> When former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified documents revealing extensive surveillance efforts both at home in America and abroad, international internet users quickly learned that the data they sent so willingly was in fact being watched. </p><p> Partly inspired by the backlash, Obama picked senior White House adviser John Podesta to lead the study group – including the commerce secretary, energy secretary, science adviser, and economic adviser – which also consulted academics, privacy advocates, technology executives, and civil rights groups. </p><p> Thursday’s report included six recommendations, most of which address lingering privacy concerns: advance the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, pass national data breach legislation, extend privacy protection to non-US persons, ensure data collected on students in schools is used for educational purposes, extend technical expertise to stop discrimination, and amend the electronic communications privacy act. </p><p> “<em>Consumers deserve clear, understandable, reasonable standards for how their personal information is used in the big data era</em>,” the first recommendation stated. “<em>We recommend the department of Commerce take appropriate consultative steps to seek stakeholder and public comment on what changes, if any, are needed to the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, first proposed by the president in 2012</em>.” </p><p> The report contains only a single passing reference to the Snowden leak during an explanation of security breach, instead focusing on the collection practices of Google, Facebook, and other online giants. </p><p> “<em>It was our task to look at these other sectors</em>,” Podesta told the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/05/01/white-house-releases-big-data-and-privacy-report/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>, adding that “it’s in no way hypocritical” for the administration not to address the NSA dragnet. </p><p> Privacy advocates reveled in the report’s suggestion to amend the Electronic Communications Privacy Act “<em>to ensure the standard of protection for online, digital content is consistent with that afforded in the physical world</em>.” </p><p> “<em>The report lays the groundwork for keeping everyone’s emails, texts and photos private and secure</em>,” Christopher Calabrese, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, told <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/01/white-house-big-data-discrimination/8566493/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>. “<em>Now Congress and the administration need to make this vision a reality by enacting ECPA reform without any loopholes</em>.” </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156288-fracking-earthquake-links-gas/</guid><title><![CDATA[​Fracking-linked earthquakes likely to worsen – seismologists]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156288-fracking-earthquake-links-gas/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/28/00/00/fracking.jpg" title="David McNew / Getty Images / AFP "/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 03:40:00 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/28/00/00/fracking.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ongoing hydraulic fracking operations will only exacerbate seismic activity, leading to heightened earthquakes in areas where wastewater is injected deep underground, according to new research.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/28/00/00/fracking.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="David McNew / Getty Images / AFP " /> <p> To unleash natural gas, hydraulic fracturing - or <a href="http://rt.com/tags/fracking/" target="_blank">fracking</a> - requires large volumes of water, sand, and chemicals to be pumped underground. Scientists attending the Seismological Society of America (SSA) annual meeting <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2014-05/ssoa-wdm041814.php" target="_blank">said</a> Thursday that this storage of wastewater in wells deep below the earth’s surface, in addition to fracking’s other processes, is changing the stress on existing faults, which could mean more frequent and larger quakes in the future. </p><p> Researchers previously believed quakes that resulted from fracking could not exceed a magnitude of 5.0, though stronger seismic events were recorded in 2011 around two heavily drilled areas in Colorado and Oklahoma. </p><p> <em>“This demonstrates there is a significant hazard,”</em> said Justin Rubinstein, a research geophysicist at the US Geological Survey (USGS), <a href="http://time.com/84225/fracking-and-earthquake-link/" target="_blank">according</a> to TIME magazine. <em>“We need to address ongoing seismicity.”</em> </p><p> Not all of the more than 30,000 fracking disposal wells are linked to quakes, but an <a href="http://rt.com/usa/central-idaho-rocked-hundreds-earthquakes-992/" target="_blank">accumulating</a> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/oklahoma-earthquake-record-fracking-961/" target="_blank">body</a> of <a href="http://rt.com/usa/states-fight-fracking-linked-earthquakes-685/" target="_blank">evidence</a> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ohio-fracking-halted-quake-306/" target="_blank">associates</a> an <a href="http://rt.com/usa/oklahoma-earthquakes-fracking-wells-826/" target="_blank">uptick</a> in seismic activity to fracking developments amid the current domestic energy boom. </p><p> The amount of toxic wastewater injected into the ground seems to provide some clarity as to what causes the earthquakes. A single fracking operation uses two to five million gallons of water, <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Fracking_and_water_consumption" target="_blank">according</a> to reports, but much more wastewater ends up in a disposal well. </p><p> <em>“There are so many injection operations throughout much of the US now that even though a small fraction might induce quakes, those quakes have contributed dramatically to the seismic hazard, especially east of the Rockies,”</em> said Arthur McGarr, a USGS scientist. The USGS researchers spoke with reporters via conference call on Thursday. </p><p> Scientists believe the cumulative effect of these operations could result in larger quakes becoming more common over time. </p><p> <em>“I think ultimately, as fluids propagate and cover a larger space, the likelihood that it could find a larger fault and generate larger seismic events goes up,”</em> Gail Atkinson, professor of earth sciences at Western University in Ontario, Canada, said at the SSA meeting. </p><p> Seismologists say that widespread oil and gas development in one area could create hazardous quakes in nearby areas not equipped to handle activity above a low-level quake. </p><p> <em>“With these huge wells, the pressure they create can travel tens of kilometers,”</em> said Katie Keranen, assistant professor of geophysics at Cornell University. </p><p> As fracking spreads to new areas like Ohio that haven’t traditionally experienced many earthquakes, the scientists said more research is needed to understand the risks involved, for policymakers and the public. </p><p> <em>“There’s a very large gap on policy here,”</em> said Atkinson. <em>“We need extensive databases on the wells that induce seismicity and the ones that don’t.”</em> </p><p> The scientists said energy industry players must offer more information on their fracking operations, and data on these actions must be made publicly available more often. </p><p> <em>“There are minimums in terms of what needs to be recorded - injection pressure and volume - but these are only made available to the public once a year,”</em> Rubenstein said. <em>“We need more information reported more frequently to do the science correctly.”</em> </p><p> Last month, state geologists in Ohio <a href="http://rt.com/usa/ohio-earthquake-fracking-appalachians-052/" target="_blank">said</a> the link between fracking and five minor quakes in the state was <em>“probable.”</em> </p><p> Outside of increased seismic activity, fracking has been linked to groundwater <a href="http://rt.com/usa/epa-energy-fracking-investigation-545/" target="_blank">contamination</a>, exacerbation of <a href="http://rt.com/usa/fracking-water-drought-shortages-768/" target="_blank">drought</a> conditions, and a <a href="http://rt.com/usa/fracking-colorado-birth-defects-477/" target="_blank">laundry</a> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/fracking-study-edc-endocrinology-391/" target="_blank">list</a> of <a href="http://rt.com/usa/epa-energy-fracking-investigation-545/" target="_blank">health</a> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/fracking-chemicals-found-well-water-243/" target="_blank">concerns</a> for <a href="http://rt.com/usa/medical-gag-rule-risks-fracking-053/" target="_blank">humans</a> and the <a href="http://rt.com/usa/california-fine-vintage-fracking-727/" target="_blank">local</a> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/methane-emissions-fracking-underestimated-epa-024/" target="_blank">environment</a>. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156292-slavyansk-army-special-operation/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ukrainian troops begin special operation in Slavyansk (PHOTOS, VIDEO)]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156292-slavyansk-army-special-operation/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/28/40/00/slavyansk-army-special-operation-.jpg" title="A Ukrainian military helicopter lands near a Ukrainian checkpoint near the town of Slavyansk in eastern Ukraine May 2, 2014 (Reuters / Baz Ratner)"/><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 02:49:17 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/28/40/00/slavyansk-army-special-operation-.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Ukrainian army has begun a special operation against pro-autonomy activists in the eastern town of Slavyansk.

Orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has denied only one NSA request in five years, will still be kept classified, as will National Security Letters from the FBI. </p><p> Peter Carr, a spokesman for the US Department of Justice, warned that the companies’ divergence from the norm constitutes a massive security flaw. He told the Post there is at least one recent example in which an early disclosure put a cooperative witness in danger, though he refused to provide any further detail. </p><p> “<em>These risks of endangering life, risking destruction of evidence, or allowing suspects to flee or intimidate witnesses are not merely hypothetical, but unfortunately routine</em>,” Carr said. </p><p> Law enforcement’s job is also complicated by the growing number of magistrate judges who are skeptical of the government’s requests. The judicial ideology has quietly spread to courts through the country, frustrating prosecutors as much as it has excited civil libertarians. </p><p> Perhaps the most outspoken opinion, though, came from Washington DC Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola, who ruled against government requests to access the Facebook page of Navy Yard gunman Aaron Alexis and a request to search the iPhone of a Georgetown University student accused of making ricin. </p><p> Facciola has consistently sought narrower, more specific requests from investigators, as evidenced by an April ruling in a case unrelated to the two aforementioned investigations. </p><p> “For the sixth time,” he wrote, as quoted by the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/low-level-federal-judges-balking-at-law-enforcement-requests-for-electronic-evidence/2014/04/24/eec81748-c01b-11e3-b195-dd0c1174052c_story.html" target="_blank">Post</a>, “<em>this court must be clear: if the government seizes data it knows is outside the scope of the warrant, it must either destroy the data or return it.

Dow’s corn and soybeans thus earned the derogatory name <em>'Agent Orange'</em> crops by <a href="http://www.dow-watch.org/" target="_blank">opponents</a> of both the highly-toxic chemical mix and the controversial use of genetically-modified organisms (<a href="http://rt.com/tags/gmo/" target="_blank">GMOs</a>) in large-scale agriculture. </p><p> Scientists, human and environmental health advocates, farming organizations, and food transparency groups have urged government regulators to think twice about unleashing more 2,4-D. </p><p> In 2012, seventy health scientists sent a <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/files/epa-24d-letter-from-70-health-scientists-2012june22_71807.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to the EPA asking it to block approval of Dow’s 2,4-D-resistant corn and soybeans for commercial sale. </p><p> Medical researchers have <a href="http://rt.com/news/brazil-roundup-monsanto-ban-721/" target="_blank">linked</a> exposure to 2,4-D, and other chemicals like it, to increased rates of cancer, Parkinson’s disease, endocrine disruption, and low sperm counts, among other conditions. Higher rates of birth anomalies have been found where there is heavy use of 2,4-D. </p><p> Health concerns had prompted the Natural Resources Defense Council to petition the EPA to halt use of the herbicide, though that effort was <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/cb/csb_page/updates/2012/2-4d-petition.html" target="_blank">defeated</a> in 2012. </p><p> <em>“With this decision it is clear that the EPA is serving the interests of Dow Chemical and the biotech industry rather than protecting our health and the environment,”</em> <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.net/press-releases/3122/epa-set-to-approve-increased-use-of-toxic-24-d-on-dows-agent-orange-crops" target="_blank">said</a> Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety. </p><p> In an agribusiness chemical arms race, Dow’s development of 2,4-D-resistant crops came about once first-generation genetically-modified crops made by Monsanto evolved to resist the company’s Roundup herbicide. The flood of new GE crops increased the use of glyphosate, which has its own <a href="http://rt.com/news/monsanto-roundup-kidney-disease-921/" target="_blank">links</a> to a <a href="http://t.co/46SQd6pDU8" target="_blank">host</a> of <a href="http://t.co/qQvUAiUEMU" target="_blank">ill</a> <a href="http://t.co/hvhc2GOy1v" target="_blank">health</a> <a href="http://t.co/XHrCBONJMe" target="_blank">effects</a>, and glyphosate-resistant <em>“superweeds.”</em> </p><p> <em>“2,4-D is not a solution to glyphosate-resistant weeds,”</em> Kimbrell said. <em>“Weeds will rapidly evolve resistance to 2,4-D as well if these crops are approved, driving a toxic spiral of ever-increasing herbicide use. Dow’s Enlist crops are a textbook example of unsustainable farming, profiting pesticide companies to the detriment of American farmers, public health and the environment.”</em> </p><p> Nevertheless, Dow maintains that farmers need an answer for <em>“hard to control”</em> weeds. </p><p> <em>“Enlist Duo herbicide will help solve the weed control challenges growers are facing, and will be another option to further reduce the potential for development of herbicide-resistant weeds,”</em> said Damon Palmer of Dow AgroSciences, a subsidy of Dow Chemical Company. </p><p> <em>“At a time when farmers need to raise crop outputs to meet growing demand, the Enlist Weed Control System will provide an important tool and substantial economic benefits,”</em> Palmer added in a press <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/article/2014-04-30/aEf.RczOKm2M.html" target="_blank">release</a>. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156256-55-schools-investigation-sexual-assault/</guid><title><![CDATA[55 colleges under investigation for mishandling sexual assault]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156256-55-schools-investigation-sexual-assault/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/26/00/00/college-2.jpg" title="Reuters / Brian Snyder"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 23:23:19 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/26/00/00/college-2.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Fifty-five US colleges and universities are currently under investigation in connection with allegations that they mishandled or ignored sexual assault and sexual harassment complaints, the US Department of Education announced Thursday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/26/00/00/college-2.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Brian Snyder" /> <p> A variety of schools – small, large, private, and public – are named on the list. Ohio State University, the University of California Berkeley, and Arizona State University are all included, listed alongside prestigious institutions like Princeton University, Dartmouth College, and Harvard University Law School. </p><p> Women and advocates of sexual assault prevention have long criticized the Department of Education (DOE) for failing to adequately investigate what some have called an epidemic of sexual abuse on American campuses. Before Thursday’s announcement the department would only confirm if a school was under review upon request. </p><p> The announcement comes days after the Obama administration issued recommendations on how to best curb the problem from a federal standpoint. </p><p> The DOE announcement made it clear that authorities are investigating whether the 55 schools have violated Title IX of a 1972 law which prohibits discrimination based on gender in all education programs and extracurricular activities that receive federal aid. </p><p> “<em>We are making this list available in an effort to bring more transparency to our enforcement work and to foster better public awareness of civil rights</em>,” Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon said in a statement to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/college-sexual-assault_n_5247267.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>. “<em>We hope this increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue. I also want to make it clear that a college or university’s appearance on this list and being the subject of a Title IX investigation in no way indicates at this stage that the college or university is violating or has violated the law</em>.” </p><p> Student activists throughout the country have repeatedly failed to convince the DOE to offer such a list, with a group called Ed Act Now denied in their request to have a complete list of schools under investigation in December. The pressure increased in January of this year, with a bipartisan group of 39 congressional lawmakers co-signing a letter to the DOE to give the public more insight. </p><p> “<em>It shouldn’t be a guessing game if the Department of education has found a history of colleges and universities failing to respond to sexual violence</em>,” wrote Representative Jackie Speier (D-California). “<em>American families have a right to know when that history is present, and institutions should be held accountable for commitments they make to the federal government to stem the violence on their campuses</em>.” </p><p> The Title IX protection has a variety of applications; it is the same law that prohibits schools from gender discrimination in sports. Now, victims of sexual assault are using the law to try to compel schools to provide adequate protection. </p><p> Little information is known about specific instances, although <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/10867156/55-schools-facing-title-ix-sex-assault-probe" target="_blank">ESPN</a> reported that the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor was accused of dropping the ball when investigating a student athlete. The school reportedly received complaints about Brendan Gibbons, a former kicker on Michigan’s football team, although it was a full year before Gibbons was expelled. </p><p> University officials failed to explain the reasoning for the year-long lapse, according to ESPN, although spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said Michigan has been “<em>fully cooperating</em>” with the DOE probe. </p><p> The White House, citing previous research studies, has said that approximately one in five female university students are assaulted, not accounting for students who never report being attacked. </p><p> President Obama recently appointed a task force of Cabinet members charged with coming up with new ways for victims to report an assault without fear of retaliation. Recommendations included identifying confidential victims’ advocates and employing better surveys to examine the circumstances where sexual assault could be more likely. </p><p> Activists say the biggest issue, though, is the DOE pulling the shroud away from what investigations were being conducted. </p><p> “<em>It’s a huge deal</em>,” Caroline Heldman – chair of Occidental College’s politics department, who helped file complaints against the campus over its handling of sexual assault cases – told the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-sexual-assault-20140501,0,7819588.story#ixzz30UpZ59l7" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times</a>. “<em>It will inspire more survivor activists to file complaints when they see schools of every stripe in every part of the country have this problem</em>.” </p><p> If a school is deemed to have not complied with the law, the department could withhold federal funding, although it has yet to do so. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156264-arizona-revenge-porn-felony/</guid><title><![CDATA[Arizona governor signs law making 'revenge porn' a felony]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156264-arizona-revenge-porn-felony/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/26/80/00/-jan-brewer.jpg" title="Arizona Gov.

Jan Brewer (Mark Wilson / Getty Images / AFP)" /> <p> The Arizona Legislature unanimously passed the bill last week, and Gov. Jan Brewer (R-Ariz.) signed it into law on Wednesday, MSNBC reported. Arizona is the ninth state to pass a law against revenge porn, also known as non-consensual pornography, but is the first to make it a felony without an exception for lawful purposes, according to the Daily Dot. </p><p> <a href="http://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2515/2014" target="_blank">The law</a> makes it a crime <em>"to intentionally disclose, display, distribute, publish, advertise or offer a photograph, videotape, film or digital recording of another person...if the person knows or should have known that the depicted person has not consented to the disclosure."</em> </p><p> The only exceptions are when reporting illegal activity to law enforcement, lawful practices of medical treatment, or images involving <em>“voluntary exposure”</em> in public, according to the Phoenix New Times. </p><p> Revenge porn is often an attempt to humiliate former lovers by publishing images and videos online of a nude person or a person engaged in a sexual act without his or her permission, according to Reuters. </p><p> Holly Jacobs, a revenge porn victim and the founder of End Revenge Porn, detailed <a href="http://www.endrevengeporn.org/a-message-from-our-founder-holly-jacobs/" target="_blank">her experience of being victimized</a> by an ex-boyfriend in a blog post. </p><p> <em>“He started posting explicit pictures and a video of me all over the Internet along with my full name, email address, job title, and specific details of where I worked and how far along I was in my PhD program,”</em> she wrote. </p><p> <em>“For 3 years damage control was a full-time job. I hired a lawyer to send him a letter. I begged and pleaded with 3 different police stations to file charges against him. I went to the FBI, and I hired an Internet specialist to help me take down the material. Ultimately, those avenues were dead ends,”</em> she continued. </p><p> Jacobs told <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/arizona-bans-revenge-porn" target="_blank">MSNBC</a> she is <em>“thrilled”</em> that Arizona will charge perpetrators of revenge porn with a felony. </p><p> <em>“I’ve been pushing for these laws to be felony charges, otherwise it doesn’t seem like it gives the police the authority they need to pursue the cases all the way through,”</em> she said. <em>“I never dreamed that we would be making as much progress as quickly as we did when we started the campaign.”</em> </p><p> But legal experts and civil rights activists warn that the new law might be an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. </p><p> <em>"It's extremely troubling,"</em> Lee Rowland, staff attorney at the ACLU, told the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/arizona-revenge-porn-non-consensual-porn-jan-brewer/" target="_blank">Daily Dot</a>, because the law <em>"also applies to pictures where the person isn’t identifiable."</em> </p><p> <em>"So posting a disembodied picture of a woman’s breast – so long as you 'should have known' they didn’t consent – could support a felony charge,"</em> she said. <em>"I think the law is overbroad and covers a significant amount of fully-protected speech."</em> </p><p> University of Arizona law professor Derek Bambauer cited a hypothetical situation in which someone had an image of Monica Lewinsky and President Bill Clinton engaged in a sex act. </p><p> <em>"I publish it in the newspaper,"</em> he explained to the Phoenix <a href="http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2014/05/jan_brewer_signs_arizona_revenge_porn_law.php" target="_blank">New Times</a>. <em>"Can I be prosecuted? Clearly not – it's a matter of public concern (the president is having an affair with an intern, a government employee), so the First Amendment blocks the prosecution."</em> </p><p> Under the law, perpetrators would face a sentence of 18 months in prison, which could be increased to 2.5 years if the victim is recognizable in the image or video. The <em>"unlawful distribution of private images"</em> can also be considered a domestic violence crime under the new law, which can include even harsher penalties, more intense release conditions from jail, or implications in custody issues, the Phoenix New Times reported. </p><p> The bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. J.D. Mesnard, told colleagues that the bill protects minors from receiving a permanent felony record if they engage in revenge porn because those cases will generally be handled in juvenile court, with the option of having their record expunged, the Arizona Daily Star reported. </p><p> <em>"I believe the bill is going to do some good,"</em> Mesnard said moments after learning that the legislation had been signed, according to Reuters. <em>"It helps with this new form of wrong, with a new form of being able to harm people. It's sad we are being forced to do something like this."</em> </p><p> Arizona joins California, Georgia, Idaho, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin as states with revenge porn laws on the books. Only in Idaho and Arizona is it a felony on the first offense; it becomes a felony on the second offense in Georgia and Utah. There are more than two dozen similar measures proposed in states nationwide, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. </p><p> Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) plans to introduce a national revenge porn bill soon, a representative from her office told the Daily Dot. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156248-russian-rocket-engines-pentagon/</guid><title><![CDATA[Pentagon says it cannot replace imported Russian rocket engines]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156248-russian-rocket-engines-pentagon/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/25/80/00/atlas.jpg" title="An Atlas 5 ULA (United Launch Alliance) rocket (Reuters / Gene Blevins)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 21:25:09 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/25/80/00/atlas.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The Pentagon cannot find a replacement for the Russian rocket engines it buys anytime soon, a senior official has revealed.

We haven’t made any decisions yet</em>,” Frank Kendall, the US undersecretary of defense for acquisition, was quoted as saying by Bloomberg in a Thursday article. The defense official spoke to the outlet after testifying before a Senate committee on the matter on Wednesday. </p><p> United Launch Alliance LLC, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) and Boeing Co. (BA), has been purchasing RD-180 rocket engines from joint Russian-American enterprise RD-Amross LLC since 1997. The engines in question have been produced at a plant of NPO Energomash near Moscow, and over 40 of them were delivered between 1997-2007 alone. </p><p> The US has used RD-180 engines to power its Atlas III and Atlas V rockets, which mostly deliver commercial or military communications satellites, as well as reconnaissance and navigation satellites. </p><h2> SpaceX fighting Russia on US space market? </h2><p> So far, the replacement options outlined by the Air Force for Hagel have reportedly included building RD-180s in the US under an existing license from the Russian maker, or using different Delta-class rockets altogether. Each of the options has its drawbacks, such as the need to harness the time and know-how for setting up engine production in the US, or the limited production capability for another class of rockets, according to Kendall. </p><p> However, even as the Pentagon has yet to come up with a definite decision on the issue, the banning of the Russian engine import is being pushed through by other US players. </p><p> US billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX corporation on Wednesday won a court order temporarily blocking the Air Force from buying the Russian rocket engines on the grounds of a “<em>potential violation</em>” of US-imposed sanctions. The corporation says that by purchasing the engines, the Air Force is funneling money to Russia’s military industrial complex, which could be sponsoring some sanctioned Russian personas. </p><p> That was only part of the April 28 complaint filed by SpaceX, which has been desperately trying to break into the military launch market. Musk has particularly been aiming to end the Boeing/Lockheed-Martin monopoly on launching military satellites in the US. </p><p> Speaking at a congressional hearing in March, Musk alleged that such launches may be at risk due to the dependence on the Russian engine. </p><p> There has not, however, been any indication that Russia could stop the production of engines already agreed upon under the latest contract, nor did the US freeze their delivery. The Wednesday court decision did not cover existing contracts or payments either. </p><p> Despite Washington’s recently ratcheted-up rhetoric on sanctions against Russia, Bloomberg learned that five more RD-180 engines are still due to be delivered this year. The further deliveries could come under question at least temporarily, as, according to Pentagon spokeswoman Maureen Schumann, the United Launch Alliance has already stockpiled a two-year supply of the engines. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156260-blast-bomb-abuja-nigeria/</guid><title><![CDATA[Explosion hits Nigeria’s capital near spot of April bombing]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156260-blast-bomb-abuja-nigeria/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/26/40/00/nigeria.jpg" title="People who were injured during an explosion are seen on stretchers at Asokoro General Hospital in Abuja May 1, 2014.

The schools will use Psychemedics Corporation for the drug tests on hair follicles. Psychemedics president and CEO Raymond Kubacki is the brother of St. Edward president James Kubacki. </p><p> K.C. McKenna, vice president of admissions and marketing at St. Edward High School, told <a href="http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2014/04/29/president-of-drug-testing-company-is-brother-of-st-edward-high-school-president"> the Cleveland Scene</a> that the decision to work with Psychemedics came after several years of research led by an internal committee made up of members of the board of trustees, a faculty member, and members of the administration. </p><p> <em>“Certainly, Jim knew a little more about the process because of his brother being involved, but his brother being CEO of that company in no way led to us making the decision to use Psychemedics,"</em> he said. </p><p> <em>“From Day One, I told them this was my brother’s company,”</em> the St. Edward’s president told <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/04/st_eds_president_is_brother_of.html"> the Plain Dealer</a>. But in their announcements, the schools made no mention of a connection between anyone at the schools and Psychemedics. </p><p> <em>“The short answer is Gilmour was very much aware of that connection from the beginning and it was never an issue,”</em> Gilmour spokesman Devin Schlickmann told the Plain Dealer. </p><p> <em>“How we picked the company isn’t of interest to high school boys,"</em> St. Ignatius spokeswoman Lisa Metro said. "<em>They’re more interested in how it’s going to play out to them.”</em> Metro also revealed why the committee decided to go with Psychemedics: <em>“They were the only lab with full FDA clearance to do the testing we were looking for,”</em> she added. </p><p> The schools said the drug testing is preventative, and not evidence of substance abuse among students, according to a <a href="http://www.sehs.net/general/custom.asp?page=wellness">statement on the St. Edward website</a>. <em>“The schools decided to initiate drug testing out of a deep concern for the health and well-being of students,”</em> the statement says. <em>“The primary purpose for this initiative is to give students another reason to say “no” to the pressures of using illegal drugs and to help them remain substance-free. This initiative is simply one more component in our student wellness efforts.”</em> </p><p> However, school leaders told The Plain Dealer that the heroin epidemic in Northeast Ohio was the <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/04/mandatory_drug_testing_to_analyze_students_hair_3_area_catholic_high_schools_to_start_practice_this_fall.html#incart_m-rpt-1"> catalyst for implementing the program</a>. </p><p> The statement did outline the decision to use hair testing over body fluids like urine or saliva. <em>“Many drugs are undetectable in urine as early as 72 hours after use, whereas they can be detected in hair samples for several months after ingestion,” the statement says. “In addition, it is much more difficult to adulterate or substitute hair samples and collection is much less intrusive, as well as more cost-effective.”</em> </p><p> Hair-testing kits cost $39 to $50 each, schools that currently work with Psychemedics told the Scene. All high school students - about 980 at St. Ed’s, 340 at Gilmour, and 1,500 at St. Ignatius - will be subject to testing at the beginning of the 2014-2015 school year, and then random testing will occur throughout the year. The three contracts combined will pay Psychemedics nearly $120,000 for the initial testing alone, the Plain Dealer reported. </p><p> According to the St. Ed’s statement, hair testing can detect drug use for up to three months. The timing of the announcement gives students a four-month warning before testing begins. <em>“The only good thing about this is that they announced it this early,”</em> one Ignatius student wrote on the Scene site<em>. “They practically winked at us while saying that the test can detect drugs used up to 3 months prior to it, and the first tests won't begin for 4 months.”</em> </p><p> The student also noted, <em>“We were also told that shaved heads would not work as the test can be done with even arm hair...And as a side note, the students will likely just be drinking a lot more.”</em> </p><p> Reactions to the new policy have been mixed. </p><p> <em>"As long as you're not doing drugs, it's not an issue,"</em> St. Edward senior Gavin Bridegum said to WKYC. <em>"It's like one piece of hair, it's not that invasive or anything. It's not a blood test."</em> </p><p> <em>“My sons attend SIHS and I don't see this as anything but a positive measure. I am grateful the administration cares enough to be this intrusive. I work in an ER and have seen all too often the result of teenage drug abuse. It's not pretty,”</em> one St. Ignatius parent wrote on the Scene website. <em>“If we can save families the tragedy of this epidemic, I'm all for it. Just because there is money to be made does not in any way indicate that was a motivating factor. This is just another example of the public/media trying to create unnecessary controversy over something.”</em> </p><p> <em>"In terms of a privacy issue, I think it might be a little bit too much,"</em> parent Diane Erny told WKYC. <em>"Where it's coming from and why?"</em> </p><p> The parent of a child who will enroll at St. Ed's in the fall told the Plain Dealer that he supports the decision to conduct drug testing, but wonders about the timing of the announcement. Other families who are against it, but who have already committed to sending their sons to the school, are now in a bind, he said. </p><p> Students will not face punishment for a positive drug test, but will receive counseling and other assistance, the St. Ed’s statement said. <em>“Ultimately, this is not designed to be a punitive program; it’s designed as a prevention and intervention strategy. By identifying students at risk, we can work with their parents and health professionals to get them the help they need and re-direct their path.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156240-spacex-musk-injunction-russia-rockets/</guid><title><![CDATA[Elon Musk halts deal between US Air Force and Russian rocket-makers]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156240-spacex-musk-injunction-russia-rockets/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/25/00/00/elon-musk.jpg" title="CEO and chief designer of SpaceX Elon Musk (Alex Wong / Getty Images / AFP)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 20:23:56 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/25/00/00/elon-musk.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />​A decision handed out late Wednesday by a United States Court of Federal Claims judge will for now keep the American aerospace industry from buying Russian-made rockets.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/25/00/00/elon-musk.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="CEO and chief designer of SpaceX Elon Musk (Alex Wong / Getty Images / AFP)" /> <p> Judge Susan G. Branden issued an injunction this week just days after California’s SpaceX company asked the US government to reconsider a deal between the Air Force and United Launch Services — a joint-venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing — that’s expected to involve space-related contracts with Russian rocket maker NPO Energomash. </p><p> SpaceX founder Elon Musk asked the feds to intervene because not only was he opposed to the Air Force awarding a non-competitive contract to the ULA without seeking other bids, but also because he thought other American companies should be considered in the midst of an international crisis that has caused tensions between Washington and Moscow to worsen in recent weeks due to the ongoing unrest in Ukraine. </p><p> The Lockheed-Boeing alliance, Musk said, relies on Russian-made engines for its Atlas V rockets. </p><p> <em>"The long-term contract, which guarantees the purchase of 36 rocket cores from ULA to be used in national security launches, was granted to ULA on a sole-source basis without any competition from other launch providers,"</em> SpaceX said in a statement last week. </p><p> <em>“This is not SpaceX protesting and saying these launches should be awarded to us,”</em> Musk added. “<em>We’re just saying these launches should be competed. If we compete and lose, that’s fine. But why would they not even compete it? That doesn’t make sense.”</em> </p><p> On Wednesday evening, Judge Branden agreed, ruling that, <em>"in the court’s judgment,the public interest and national defense and security concerns that underlie Executive Order 13,661 warrant issuance of a preliminary injunction in this case,”</em> thus prohibiting both the US Air Force and ULA <em>“from making any purchase from or payment of money to NPO Energomash.”</em> <br><br> Judge Branden’s decision also prohibits the Air Force and ULA from doing business with any entity, whether governmental, corporate or individuals, that is controlled by Russia’s deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin — just one of the latest foreign officials sanctioned by Washington as a result of Moscow’s perceived role in the unrest that continues to plague eastern Ukraine. </p><p> After being hit with sanctions, Rogozin announced over Twitter on Thursday that he had a new plan that could help get the US into space without relying on Russian companies any longer. </p><p> </p><p> <em>"After analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest the US delivers its astronauts to the ISS [international space station] with a trampoline.”</em> Rogozin wrote. </p><p> NBC News reported this week that Judge Branden’s Wednesday night decision will keep the Air Force and ULA from purchasing any Russian-made engines unless and until either the Department of Treasury or Commerce say such contractors wouldn’t go against US sanctions. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156252-germany-snowden-testify-nsa/</guid><title><![CDATA[Germany drops Snowden’s invite to testify on NSA spying in person]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156252-germany-snowden-testify-nsa/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/25/c0/00/snowden.jpg" title="Reuters / Vincent Kessler "/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 20:15:17 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/25/c0/00/snowden.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Germany will not be inviting whistleblower Edward Snowden to testify in front of a parliamentary committee which investigates US spying tactics of EU leaders and nationals, a German MP said on Thursday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/25/c0/00/snowden.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Vincent Kessler " /> <p> A member of the investigative committee from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) said in a statement that the government opposes Snowden testifying in the case regarding the National Security Agency (NSA)'s activities in Germany. </p><p> <em>"The federal government has never been in any doubt that there is no legal basis for Mr. Snowden to travel to Germany,"</em> Roderich Kiesewetter of the CDU said in a statement, as quoted by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p> His statement came in response to a media report that accused the government of blocking Snowden’s visit to Germany because of diplomatic reasons. </p><p> The report published earlier on Thursday by Süddeutsche Zeitung said that a personal invitation to the former NSA contractor and leaker would <em>"run counter to the political interests of the Federal Republic"</em> and "<em>put a grave and permanent strain"</em> on US-German relations. </p><p> German opposition members from the Left and Green party who are involved in the investigation believe that Snowden is a key witness and should testify in person. But the CDU believes a written questionnaire would suffice. </p><p> The whistleblower is currenty in Russia under temporary asylum. He asked for asylum in Germany last summer, but his application was rejected because he didn't file it from German soil. If Snowden would have been invited to testify, he could have met the requirements. </p><p> Meanwhile, opposition members have slammed Merkel for being cowardly towards the US. </p><p> <em>"Merkel is displaying cowardice towards our ally America,"</em> said Green party leader Simone Peter, as quoted by the Guardian. <em>"We owe the Americans nothing in this respect. The government must at least make a serious effort to safely bring Snowden to Germany and let him give evidence here. But Merkel doesn't want that."</em> </p><p> Merkel’s office said on Tuesday that the chancellor will raise the NSA surveillance issue during her upcoming visit to the US. She will meet with President Barack Obama on Friday. </p><p> Clemense Binninger, chair of the investigative committee, believes that getting at least some response from the Americans would be <em>“an important step forward to restoring trust,”</em> Deutsche Welle reported in April. </p><p> Snowden's revelations regarding US spying on Germany continue to pour in. Der Spiegel recently published additional leaked data, including information that the NSA compiled a comprehensive dossier on Merkel, which included over 300 intelligence reports. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156244-student-footage-korean-ferry/</guid><title><![CDATA[Newly released footage details students' last moments aboard sinking S.

(AFP Photo / Ed Jones)" /> <p> <strong>[WARNING: You might find the footage or the description of events below disturbing]</strong> </p><p> The video was found on a phone belonging to one of the students, 17-year old Park Su-hyeon. The video was released to South Korean television by Park’s father after the teenager’s body was recovered from the vessel by South Korean coast guard rescuers. </p><p> All the faces of the passengers have been blocked out as many of their bodies have not yet been recovered. </p><p> In the clip it is 8:52 am, April 16, and the ferry is getting increasingly unstable. Only one of the teenagers can be seen wearing a life jacket. By the end of the footage the ship’s tilting gets worse and everyone appears to be wearing one. </p><p> The students are visibly startled by the events, but try to hide the unease joking about <em>“defying gravity”</em> and trying to walk on the walls as the ship lists. <em>“This is like Titanic,”</em> says one, while another replies <em>“this is fun”.</em> </p><p> Several times the students are warmed over the loudspeaker to stay where they are. Meanwhile, the listing of the ship makes it more and more difficult to get out. </p><p> One of the boys says <em>“I want to get off. We don’t want to die.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> As their situation gets increasingly perilous, some of them realize they must try and leave the ship before it’s too late. </p><p> <em>“I’m getting out of here”</em>, says one of them. <em>“Me too, me too”</em> says another. <em>“We have to survive now,”</em> says someone else. </p><p> As the crew hand out more and more life jackets, one of the student’s says: <em>“I don’t know what’s going on. If they are telling us to wear life jackets, doesn’t it mean that it is sinking?”</em> </p><p> One of the students then leaves a message for his mum, saying <em>“Mom, I love you.”</em> Another says, <em>“We’re all finished. I have to leave some farewell words before I die.”</em> </p><p> More than two weeks into the disaster, over 210 people have been confirmed dead and a further 89 are still unaccounted for. Some bodies have been recovered from as much as two kilometers from the wreckage of the ship due to the strong ocean currents leading to concerns that some bodies might never be found. </p><p> The release of the video comes after news that 14 members of the crew have been arrested and that the owner of the ferry ignored warnings from an off duty captain that the ship’s stability had been compromised by a refurbishment which made it too heavy. </p><p> The captain also warned that the ship should not carry too much cargo after the refurbishment. The Sewol was proved to have been carrying three times over its recommended cargo weight. </p><div class="full_transcript"> <a href="">Read the full transcript</a> </div><div class="full_transcript_text"> <p> <strong>Full script of recorded conversations</strong> </p> <p> Audio on ferry's speaker says "Don't move away from your places and brace for any possible accidents." </p> <p> A student says "Am I really going to die?" </p> <p> A curtain showing "It is not time to laugh.

A simple, old-fashioned letterhead with a suitable blunt message is all it takes. But is it foolproof?]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/26/24/80/00/picture.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Justin Sullivan / Getty Images / AFP " /> <p> It isn’t secret, but it is a weapon of stealth. It doesn’t arrive by drone; rather it drops in through the regular mail. The “scarlet letter” was devised under Section 311 of the US Patriot Act in the wake of 9/11. The aim is simple – it is a way of ensuring that your friend is actually your friend, and a means to convince your foe's service providers to rethink their affiliations, too. </p><p> Clearly if you have a branch in the USA, the last thing you want is a horde of federal agents roaming across your brand, looking for evidence of suspicious financial activity throughout the open office cubicles, or, worse still, the C-suite offices. Thus America has a simple tool, a piece of correspondence which looks akin to a standard bulk mailshot from the 1980's but is much, much more likely to elicit a response from the recipient than an offer to subscribe to Reader’s Digest. Essentially those who provide business services, as well as banks and insurers, are a perfect target. Service providers can be accused of money laundering, or the difficult to define concept of underwriting terrorist offenses and thus be inflicted with a toxic stain of reputational damage, not to mention a lengthy court process and likely restitution. </p><p> Such processes recently captured the Clearstream business of Germany’s stock exchange. Clearstream had not broken European sanctions to Iran but by dint of having an office in the US, federal officials extracted a $152 million fine. Criminal investigations are ongoing. </p><p> When faced with large fines and, worse still, a spell in an orange jumpsuit, even the most focussed of client organizations are keen to mouth the mantra that “central government (not the client) is always right.” </p><p> Thus in the short term, the scarlet letter process could wreak havoc by targeting those who deal with Russia. Then again, previous successes have all been relatively minor affairs. China capitulated to scarlet letters in 2005, but that concerned a tiny bank in Macau – hardly an institution which was at the epicenter of Chinese finance, dealing with North Korea. In a world where Visa and MasterCard barely disappeared for hours before the systems were switched on again in Moscow, can the US realistically wield such exhaustive power against Russia? </p><p> Initially, scarlet letters clearly scare off anybody with offices in the USA and perhaps those who don’t concentrate on US dealings but are worried about Western brand damage. However, given that Russia remains a lucrative source of high yield debt, is it impossible to conceive that no other nations will want to have some investment interaction? After all, current refunding worries in Russia can only lead to a desire to borrow money at higher rates and those higher rates will benefit savers...will bond buying be bolstered by Russian citizens, perhaps? Or will it fall to traditionally non-aligned states or those less sympathetic to the US, to channel funds towards the rich opportunity of Russian debt and equity markets? </p><p> Scarlet letters have a remarkable deterrent value for the home US constituency and may even prove a better way to whip the EU into America’s desire for harsher sanctions than simply choosing names from the Kremlin area telephone directory, as appears to be the current vogue. In the modern world, payment systems are diverging from Anglo-American analogue era legacy systems to state of the art decentralized digital blockchains competing in cyberspace…Who can tell who is providing investment funds, if, for instance Russia just opts to ignore the old Western money markets and seeks debt issues in anonymized bitcoin instead? </p><p> Scarlet letters are clearly a powerful deterrent but they are not a panacea. In the brave new world of digital technology, pieces of paper have some remarkable legacy uses but they are unlikely to be able to outperform the power of a vast multinational network. In the single superpower model, America had a huge advantage with the Scarlet letter. In a world where many increasingly question the competence of Messrs Obama, Biden, and Kerry et al to manage US affairs coherently, it is not unreasonable to assume a widespread letter writing campaign may initially draw blood but soon the natural impact of higher returns will attract cash from within Russia, or the Middle East, or perhaps elsewhere amongst the BRICS…Markets abhor a vacuum. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156220-darth-vader-ukraine-mayor/</guid><title><![CDATA[Dark side of Ukraine’s election: Darth Vader runs for mayor in Kiev, Odessa]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156220-darth-vader-ukraine-mayor/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/c0/00/darth-vader-main.jpg" title="&quot;Darth Vader&quot;, first deputy head of the Internet Party of Ukraine (Reuters / Shamil Zhumatov)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 19:16:08 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/23/c0/00/darth-vader-main.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Sith Lord Darth Vader, whose Ukraine presidency bid was earlier rejected, has been registered as a candidate for mayoral elections in the capital Kiev and the port city of Odessa, with a plan to run for the top seat in “all key cities” in the country.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/c0/00/darth-vader-main.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt=""Darth Vader", first deputy head of the Internet Party of Ukraine (Reuters / Shamil Zhumatov)" /> <p> The Odessa election commission voted Thursday to register 'Darth Nikolayevich Vader' for the mayoral election on May 25, the same day that Ukraine is due to elect a new president. </p><p> The Star Wars villain will fight for the post with 18 other contenders – primarily earthly Ukrainian politicians and businessmen. </p><p> “<em>The registration is completed. The first step towards the victory is made. Power is itself coming into my hands and I’m not ready to resist,</em>” said Vader, according to the website for the Internet party of Ukraine, which nominated him as a candidate. </p><p> </p><p> The former Jedi Knight and deputy leader of the party has also registered to take part in the Kiev mayoral vote. Vader has twice won the party's primaries, the group said. </p><p> Apparently, an unsuccessful attempt to join Ukraine’s presidential race has not discouraged Lord Vader. Earlier this year, he <a href="http://rt.com/news/vader-presidential-hopeful-ukraine-885/" target="_blank">submitted documents</a> to the Central Election Commission, but was refused registration, while two courts in Kiev threw out his suits against the decision. </p><p> “<em>They stole my victory at the presidential elections, but failed to steal my will for the victory. I assure all my supporters – my decisiveness has never been stronger than it is now,</em>” Vader said. “<em>That’s why I made a decision to run for mayor, mayors of all key cities in Ukraine. Soon I will be in your city, too</em>.” </p><p> </p><p> Vader’s “cabinet maker” is already working on a proper imperial seat, or rather a throne, that Lord Vader is planning to place in his office if he wins. </p><p> Vader is not a newbie to Ukrainian politics. During the 2012 parliamentary election, he scored three percent of votes, according to his party. Unfortunately, the votes were never registered because supporters each had to add Vader’s name to the ballots, which rendered them void under Ukrainian law. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156228-stress-contagious-say-scientists/</guid><title><![CDATA[Is stress contagious?

The research notes that in a society where stress is everywhere, emphatic stress is a phenomenon that cannot be ignored. </p><p> Stress can affect a general environment in a psychologically quantifiable way through increased concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol. </p><p> <em>“The fact that we could actually measure this empathic stress in the form of a significant hormone release was astonishing,”</em> said Veronika Engert, one of the main authors of the study. <em>“There must be a transmission mechanism via which the target’s state can elicit a similar state in the observer down to the level of a hormonal stress response.”</em> </p><p> During the test, subjects were asked to complete difficult mental arithmetic tasks and interviews while two behavioral analysts watched their performance. Only five percent of the directly stressed subjects were able to stay calm. </p><p> Twenty-six percent of observers – who were not directly exposed to the stress – also showed a significant increase in cortisol. </p><p> While observers watched stressful events through the one-way mirror, 30 percent of them experienced a stress response. Even when watching virtually, through a video link, cortisol levels rose in 24 percent of observers. </p><p> <em>“A hormonal stress response has an evolutionary purpose, of course. When you are exposed to danger, you want your body to respond with an increase in cortisol. However, permanently elevated cortisol levels are not good,”</em> explained Engert. </p><p> Anyone who is confronted with the sustained suffering and stress of another person is likely to have a higher risk of being affected themselves. </p><p> The research also dispelled a common myth that women are more empathic than men, finding that men and women experience emphatic stress with equal frequency.

(AFP Photo / Pool / Junko Kimura-Matsumoto)" /> <p> There were speeches clearly aimed at swelling anti-Chinese and anti-North Korean sentiments, and there were promises to ‘defend’ certain countries, including South Korea and Japan, although both of them appear to be more belligerent than their communist alleged adversaries. </p><p> There was immediate reaction from Pyongyang, calling South Korean President Park Geun-Hye a “prostitute,” and there was an ice-cold reaction from Beijing, calling on the US and Japan to “abandon their cold war mentality.” </p><p> The US language was, as always, patronizing, even insulting – as in The New York Times’ report: </p><p> <em>“Jeffrey A. Bader, who was the senior China adviser on the National Security Council until 2011, said: 'The message is: Don’t think that what Putin is doing in eastern Ukraine is so brilliant that you should be inspired by it. Don’t think that this is a model that could work for you.'”</em> </p><p> This kind of unsavory preaching is naturally despised in China and in many other countries. </p><p> But Obama’s visit was disastrous on many other fronts, too. There were trade deals proposed that never fully materialized, including those between the United States and Japan. There were bilateral trade agreements signed between the US and Malaysia, but the 12-country Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which commits countries to lower import tariffs and therefore horrifies local producers, never really materialized. </p><p> </p><p> What actually occurred was the signing of what Reutersdescribed as “<em>a 10-year military pact with the Philippines that opens the way for US troops, planes and warships to have greater access to bases in the Philippines</em>.” </p><p> Officially, it was to ‘protect’ the Philippines from the rising ‘threat’ of China. Although many of the intellectuals in Manila see the United States as pitching southeast nations against its great neighbor. </p><p> Eduardo C. Tadem, a leading Philippine academic and professor of Asian studies at the University of the Philippines, commented for this report: </p><p> <em>"The Obama administration has not departed substantially from the policies of its predecessors as far as foreign policy is concerned. Given this, it does not possess the moral authority to lecture China on the proper behavior of a big power in the Asia-Pacific region. Granted that China has not been on its best behavior with respect to the territorial disputes it is embroiled with in the region, it is the US, on the whole, that has done much more damage against Asian peoples and societies with its imperial policies in both the economic and political spheres. Neither does it have the moral authority to lead Asian societies in charting a new economic order given its own failed economy with high unemployment and continually rising inequalities."</em> </p><p> Malaysia became a brand new addition to the list of US ‘allies’ in the region, although, to what extent, still remains to be seen. </p><p> </p><p> As I landed at the habitually super-efficient Kuala Lumpur International Airport on April 26, long lines formed queues before the immigration counters, and arriving passengers were fingerprinted – something that is very rarely done in Malaysia. </p><p> The rail network had collapsed, express trains were running on local tracks, and I was told that many of the roads in the capital had been blocked. </p><p> Overall, in Malaysia, the entire ‘presidential charade’ was thoroughly embarrassing, even from the point of view of the former ruler of the country, and one of the most outspoken critics of the West on the Asian continent, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. The former prime minister particularly distrusted the proposed TPP or TPPA. Malaysian filmmaker and TV producer Azreen Madzlan shared her experience with me: </p><p> <em>“According to former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad during an interview with a local business channel Capital TV, for the show that I was producing, Malaysia should not be compelled to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) just because of President Obama’s visit to Malaysia this weekend. Tun M who has openly roasted Najib’s administration for its intention to sign on with the non-transparent deal continues to warn that TPPA is a controlled trade agreement put together by an impoverished nation trying to exploit the natural resources of other countries.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> But the Malaysian media had chosen to welcome the supreme leader of the Western world with loud fanfares, even using the most poetic words. </p><p> Huge headlines shouted from the top of most of the local dailies: 'Hello Malaysia,' the self-proclaimed 'people's paper,' the Sunday Star, wrote as it depicted the grinning face of Barack Obama. The paper then commented: <em>“F</em><em>lashing his infectious smile, President Barack Obama stepped out of Air Force One, gave his customary right handed “hello” wave – and charmed every one of the dignitaries who met him as he arrived for his official visit to the country. It will be a busy day for him before he leaves for Manila tomorrow.”</em> </p><p> Western media opted for a wide range of attitudes, from hardcore propaganda to the phlegmatic style adopted by The New York Times: </p><p> <em>“On Sunday, President Obama visited Malaysia to underscore how much has changed in the past 16 years – not least in the country’s attitude toward the United States, which has evolved from deep suspicion, verging on contempt, to a cautious desire for cooperation.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Legendary Malaysian political activist Hishamuddin Rais (he identifies himself as a ‘non-government individual’) wrote for this report: </p><p> <em>“Obama is trying to recreate the atmosphere of the Cold War in Asia in particular and globally...Obama’s trip to Malaysia in particular is aimed at the Malaysian leadership to open up and allow access to the Malaysian market. At the same time America is keen to have a military arrangement with Malaysia, i.e. the possibility of having a base. This is a move partly to control the Southeast Asian market and also to contain what Americans term as the danger of China. Obama is trying to create a wedge between ASEAN nations and China. In Malaysia in particular, with the weak government of Najib Razak, Obama will force Najib to sign the TPPA trade agreement. It is a fact that TPPA will be destructive to the domestic market.”</em> </p><p> There was plenty of cliché propaganda talk from US officials about ‘defending democracy,' about freedom and trade, and about all those ‘terrible countries’ that the ‘benevolent and wise West’ has to ‘deal with.' </p><p> The increasingly aggressive role of the United States and the 'Western world’ has not been discussed in the suddenly over-polite local media outlets. It should have been. Because between the lines, it was clear that the goal of Obama’s journey was to flex muscles, and to show Asia who is still in charge here. </p><p> And of course, to re-pledge support for the most obedient ones, like Japan and the Philippines, over their policy towards China, or in the case of Japan, its open hostility towards the great neighbor. </p><p> It is essential that the Asian countries that are now willing to collaborate with the West are actually becoming co-responsible for what can be best described as the imperialist, neo-colonialist, even fascist, adventurism of North America and Europe. </p><p> </p><p> In the future, history may judge them very harshly! </p><p> The West, including the United States, has embarked on all sorts of genocidal projects all over the Asia Pacific region for centuries. It has terrorized this part of the world with tremendous force and determination, from Vladivostok to East Timor. </p><p> Be it not for the servility of Asian leaders, and for the total manipulation of history, Air Force One would have been met with jet fighters and interceptors – not with flowers and national anthems. </p><p> The problem is that in the Asia Pacific region, in many parts of it at least, the countries are governed by thoroughly shameless ‘elites’ (read thugs, bandits), and these individuals are united with Western economic and political ‘leaders' in their determination to plunder and mug everything that grows, hides below the surface, and even walks and talks. </p><p> This is especially true about the places like the Philippines and Indonesia, but also about Thailand, Cambodia, and even, to a lesser extent, South Korea. </p><p> Japan is an exception, as it has willingly and shamelessly been exchanging its independence for a rich and comfortable quality of life, willingly accepting the role of an obedient, sclerotic, and depressed (but extremely well paid) servant of the West, on the Asian continent. </p><p> David McNeill, a leading expert on Japan and a Professor at Sophia University, recently explained during our conversation and the filming of my Okinawa documentary, in Tokyo: </p><p> <em>“Japan, after the Second World War, aligned itself very quickly with America… And Japan’s military alliance with America is also accompanied with, what critics would say, its subservient attitude towards Washington.”</em> </p><p> </p><p> Let’s just revisit a few of the most horrifying atrocities the West performed in the Asia Pacific region, in the last hundred years or so. </p><p> Both British and US forces occupied, brutally, the city of Vladivostok in Russia's Far East after the Bolshevik Revolution. </p><p> China was plundered and colonized by European forces, brutally and relentlessly. </p><p> Korea was terrorized by mainly North American troops, with the most horrific toll on the local, mainly civilian population, with an estimated death toll of over four million people. </p><p> During WWII, Japan endured firebombing and the carpet-bombing of its cities, including Tokyo, as well as basically, two nuclear experiments against its population in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. </p><p> The French barbarically tortured, raped, and mutilated the people of Vietnam, but also those of Laos and Cambodia. The savagery exceeded even that of the later US ‘involvement,' as many local people, whilst I lived in Hanoi for three years, explained to me. </p><p> In 'Indochina,' the US, of course, bombed to ashes entire cities, poisoned the countryside, raped the female population of entire villages, and committed atrocities comparable only to those they themselves had earlier committed in Korea. Historians are still arguing about the death toll: Was it six million or ten million, during what they called the ‘Vietnam War’ and the ‘Secret War in Laos?' (In that part of the world, that genocide is squarely identified as the ‘American War’). </p><p> The US also made sure to open the doors to the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia (by carpet-bombing most of the Cambodian countryside into the stone ages), later vocally demanding their return to power, from the floor of the United Nations and other organizations. All that, of course, happened after Vietnamese troops had kicked out Pol Pot’s boys and girls from power (the US considered it a great crime). </p><p> Kissinger had it very clear: He suggested that “<em>anything that flies should be used against anything that moves</em>,” and he had it his way. And he never faced a firing squad for this, although his tactics were not too different from those employed by the German Nazis. </p><p> In the Philippines, the US committed much greater atrocities than Japan (including the Balanginga massacre), but a brainwashing campaign, and the servility of most of the local media, made it impossible to discuss these topics openly. </p><p> The Philippines were brutally colonized by both Spain and the United States, but the US propagandists have managed to re-narrate the entire history of the archipelago. </p><p> British rule in what is now Malaysia and Singapore was very far from benevolent. </p><p> </p><p> The Thai Western ally murdered its communists, as well as student protesters, and placed its territory at the disposal of the West during the Vietnam War. </p><p> Indonesia was repeatedly attacked by the United States from its bases in the Philippines, during the reign of the progressive and anti-Western President Sukarno. </p><p> The US-sponsored military coup brought the military junta to power, and some two to three million Indonesians were murdered – mainly communists, Chinese citizens, and intellectuals. Fascist Indonesia then occupied (with the support of the West) tiny East Timor, where some 30 percent of the population lost their lives in a horrific genocide. Western media hushes up coverage of the ongoing genocide against the Papuan population, as it greatly benefits the interests of Western mining companies. </p><p> Still, collaboration with the US appears to be an attractive option to many governments in the region. </p><p> China is watching, and, not surprisingly, it appears that it does not like what it sees at all. Russia, another great ‘Asian’ power is even more outraged. North Korea is, as always, ‘ready.' </p><p> Mr. Obama may count on the weak and submissive allies, but Asia is changing. It is evolving. It is watching. It may soon begin saying “No.” </p><p> Mr. Obama decided to visit South Korea but not China. </p><p> Does it matter? Maybe...but for how long? </p><p> "<em>If you come or do not come, we will be here</em>," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang. </p><p> <strong><em>Andre Vltchek</em></strong> <em>is a novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist.

Reid (D-Nevada) during a recent address at the ranch, where supporters remain on site after federal officials attempted last month to confiscate the cattle of Bundy — a 67-year-old rancher who has more than two decades has refused to pay the government fees for grazing on land that the feds say is US property. </p><p> Vanderboegh of Alabama and others have stood guard at the Bundy ranch in the days since the US Bureau of Land Management began and then aborted their attempt to confiscate cattle, but nevertheless continue to generate controversy. </p><p> Reid last week called Bundy a “<em>hateful racist</em>” who “<em>mooched</em>” off the government after the rancher was caught making remarks to the New York Times considered to be pro-slavery. </p><p> <em>“Cliven Bundy has spent decades profiting off government land while refusing to pay the same fair use fees as his fellow ranchers,”</em> Reid said last Thursday, adding that <em>“by denigrating people who work hard and play by the rules while he mooches off public land, he also revealed himself to be a hypocrite.”</em> </p><p> Now in the newly surfaced video, Vanderboegh says Reid <em>“is promising us all civil war on a vast scale, because state-sponsored violence is the only way they can win an argument with free people, especially free people who are armed and who are willing to use those arms in defense of liberty.”</em> </p><p> <em>“All over this country, we are still staring civil war in its bloody face,”</em> Vanderboegh is caught saying on camera. </p><p> <em>“Don’t poke the wolverine with a sharp stick, Harry,”</em> Vanderboegh added. <em>“Unless you want your balls ripped off.”</em> </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2uEXkmMealE?feature=player_embedded" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> The latest tirade is likely to not help Bundy supports, however: earlier this week, POLITICO <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/cliven-bundy-harry-reid-threat-106106.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that federal officials are investigating alleged threat made at Reid in the days since he spoke out against the rancher. </p><p> <em>“We are currently looking into threatening statements made against Sen. Reid as part of an ongoing investigation,”</em> Shennell Antrobus, a spokesman for the US Capitol Police, told the DC-based newspaper on Monday. </p><p> One day earlier, a US congressman who represents a region of Nevada just outside of Bundy’s ranch, said he was concerned about the armed militia groups that have descended there in recent weeks. </p><p> <em>“We must respect individual constitutional liberties, but the residents of and visitors to Clark County should not be expected to live under the persistent watch of an armed militia,”</em> Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nevada) wrote in a letter to Clark County Sheriff Douglas Gillespi on Sunday. </p><p> On his part, Reid said previously that Bundy’s supporters are “domestic terrorists.” </p><p> The latest outburst from Vanderboegh isn’t the first to make national headlines, however. Back in 2010, the Three Percenters leader urged militiamen to throw bricks through the windows of Democratic lawmakers from coast-to-coast. </p><p> <em>"So, if you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party [that they] cannot fail to hear, break their windows,"</em> Vanderboegh wrote on his Sipsey Street Irregulars blog, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/25/AR2010032501722.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> reported at the time. "<em>Break them NOW. Break them and run to break again. Break them under cover of night. Break them in broad daylight. Break them and await arrest in willful, principled civil disobedience. Break them with rocks. Break them with slingshots. Break them with baseball bats. But BREAK THEM."</em> </p><p> On the Sipsey Street Irregulars page, the Three Percenters group claim to be <em>“the people that the collectivists who now control the government should leave alone if they wish to continue unfettered oxygen consumption.</em>” Their name refers to the percentage of colonial Americans who are alleged to have fought against the British during the Revolutionary War. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/156208-missing-plane-malaysia-report/</guid><title><![CDATA[Four hours of confusion: Malaysia releases MH370 report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/156208-missing-plane-malaysia-report/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/00/00/malasia-plane.jpg" title="A graphic of the area being searched for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 (AFP Photo/ Pool / Greg Wood)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 18:02:13 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/23/00/00/malasia-plane.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A preliminary report released by Malaysia’s Transport Ministry reveals that officials didn’t notice for 17 minutes that the missing flight had gone off radar and didn’t activate an official rescue operation until four hours after the disappearance.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/00/00/malasia-plane.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A graphic of the area being searched for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 (AFP Photo/ Pool / Greg Wood)" /> <p> The five-page report notes that the plane disappeared from radar in Kuala Lumpur at 01:21 local time on March 8. As the plane’s crew should have contacted Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, Vietnamese air traffic controllers waited 17 minutes before asking Malaysian air traffic control where the plane was. After this, there was a four-hour gap before an official rescue operation was launched. </p><p> On Tuesday, a Malaysian official said the aircraft could have flown on for another seven-and-a-half hours, meaning that the plane may have been airborne in the four-hour gap, and for two-and-a-half hours after the fruitless search began. </p><p> There is also confusion surrounding the role of Malaysia’s military on the night of the disappearance. Malaysia's prime minister has said that the military tracked a plane on its radar that may have been flight MH370 as it made a westerly turn and headed back across the Malaysian peninsular. But the report makes no mention of the military at all. </p><p> Compared to other reports on recent major flight investigations, this one is scant at best. In contrast, the preliminary report into Air France 447 was released one month after the plane disappeared but was 128 pages long. And a preliminary report into the Quantas engine explosion over Singapore in 2010 was more than 40 pages with diagrams and charts. </p><p> </p><p> The report makes one safety recommendation, for real-time air tracking to be installed on all commercial aircraft. </p><p> <em>“There have now been two occasions during the last five years when large commercial air transport aircraft have gone missing and their last position was not accurately known. This uncertainty resulted in significant difficulty in locating the aircraft in a timely manner,”</em> the report states. </p><p> The same recommendation was made after the Air France jet crashed into the Atlantic in 2009, though nothing was done to satisfy the proposal. </p><p> There is also anger at why Malaysian authorities delayed making their report available to passengers' relatives and the public, even though the same report was delivered to the International Aviation Organization some days ago. </p><p> Relatives advised to go home </p><p> Malaysia Airlines has advised the families of passengers to go home, adding that they will receive any further updates by phone or other means. </p><p> Since the aircraft's disappearance, the airline has been providing hotels for the families. Malaysia Airlines has stated it will close its support centers by May 7, though it will open two different <em>“family support centers”</em> in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur. </p><p> The airline also announced Thursday that it will start paying advance compensation to MH370 passengers' next-of-kin to help with their immediate economic needs. </p><p> </p><h2> Where is the plane wreckage? </h2><p> The report's release comes just one day after the large-scale air search – which was being operated out of the Royal Australian Air Force base in Pearce, north of Perth, for more than six weeks – was finally called off. </p><p> Despite over ten planes taking part in the search, nothing from the missing aircraft was found. A scaled-down search by ships and submersible vessels will continue for an indefinite amount of time. </p><p> GeoResonance, an Australian firm, says it has used spectral analysis from satellite and plane images to detect the presence of aluminum, titanium, and copper in the Bay of Bengal, which it says is from a commercial jet. </p><p> But GeoResonance’s claims are not supported by the majority of aviation experts. </p><p> <em>“My blood is boiling. I’ve talked to the leading experts in satellite capability in NASA, and they know of no technology that is capable of doing this. I am just horrified that a company would use this event to gain attention like this,”</em> Miles O’ Brien, an aviation expert, told CNN. </p><p> But with the search area in the southern Indian Ocean yielding no results, investigators have to take all claims seriously. Bangladesh has sent two navy ships to the location in the Bay of Bengal cited by GeoResonance. </p><p> <em>“I think at this point, because of the lack of results where they’ve been searching for weeks, they’re almost stuck. They have to go look,”</em> said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the US Department of Transportation. </p><p> The search began in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam until it was revealed by satellite data that the missing plane was still airborne for seven-and-a-half hours after it lost contact with air traffic control. </p><p> After this, researchers analyzing the data said the plane most likely came down somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, off the coast of Australia. </p><p> A new search then began, coordinated by Australia and involving planes and ships from eight nations – Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Malaysia, the US, Japan, South Korea, and China. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156212-obama-biden-vacation-tab-40/</guid><title><![CDATA[Fighting income inequality: Obama-Biden vacation tab reaches $40 mn]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156212-obama-biden-vacation-tab-40/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/40/00/obama-biden.jpg" title="US President Barack Obama (R) and Vice President Joe Biden  (AFP Photo / Jewel Samad)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 17:48:39 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/23/40/00/obama-biden.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A vacation tab racked up by President Obama and Vice President Biden has gotten pretty hefty – reaching $40 million, according to a taxpayer watchdog group.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/23/40/00/obama-biden.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="US President Barack Obama (R) and Vice President Joe Biden  (AFP Photo / Jewel Samad)" /> <p> In a statement released by Judicial Watch, the group stated it had gotten its hands on documentation from the US Air Force, via Freedom of Information Act requests, that reveals the cost of flying Obama and Biden alone routinely exceeds hundreds of thousands of dollars per hour in the air. </p><p> According to the Washington Examiner, which obtained the release, the president’s two golf outings this year cost roughly $2.9 million in taxpayer funds. </p><p> Judicial Watch estimates that since 2009, American taxpayers have spent about $40 million flying Obama and Biden to various destinations – not just golf outings in Palm Springs, California, but also for vacations to Hawaii and trips to Africa. </p><p> Additionally, the group stated that even more money is spent on accommodation, vehicle transportation, Secret Service protection, and other things. The president of Judicial Watch says the amount of spending amounts to <em>"abuse."</em> </p><p> <em>“It is clear that the Obamas continually abuse the perks of the president’s office at taxpayer expense,”</em> said Tom Fitton, according to the Examiner. <em>“And it is particularly interesting that Obama has chosen to take not one but two luxury vacations back-to-back while inveighing against ‘income equality.’ President Obama’s waste of the hard-earned tax dollars of working Americans on unnecessary luxury travel is an abuse of office.”</em> </p><p> This isn’t the first time the cost of the president’s travel has been subject to scrutiny by Judicial Watch. In March, the group announced that Obama’s trips to Hawaii and Africa in 2013 cost nearly $16 million in flight costs alone. In particular, the trip to Africa was criticized by some after reports indicated that, based on previous presidential journeys to the continent, it could cost between $60 million and $100 million. </p><p> With the trip taking place as sequestration forced cuts in various government agencies, Obama's political opponents have criticized him for taking the trip while canceling White House tours. </p><p> <em>“For the cost of this trip to Africa, you could have 1,350 weeks of White House tours,”</em> Rep. George Holding (R-N.C.) said at the time. <em>“It is no secret that we need to rein in government spending, and the Obama administration has regularly and repeatedly shown a lack of judgment for when and where to make cuts.”</em> </p><p> But those with experience in planning presidential trips have chalked up the costs as par for the course. </p><p> <em>“Even in the most developed places of Western Europe, the level of support you need for mass movements by the president is really extraordinary,”</em> said Steve Atkiss, who helped coordinate travel under President George W. Bush, to the Washington Post. <em>“As you go farther afield, to less-developed places, certainly it’s more of a logistical challenge.”</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/156204-nato-vershbow-russia-adversary/</guid><title><![CDATA[NATO’s second-in-command says Russia is now an enemy, not a partner]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/156204-nato-vershbow-russia-adversary/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/26/22/c0/00/nato-official-russia-now-an-adversary.jpg" title="NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow (AFP Photo / Yuri Kadobnov)"/><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 17:08:46 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/26/22/c0/00/nato-official-russia-now-an-adversary.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow now says that the allied group has been compelled to treat Russia “as more of an enemy than a partner,” according to an Associated Press report published Thursday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/26/22/c0/00/nato-official-russia-now-an-adversary.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow (AFP Photo / Yuri Kadobnov)" /> <p> The 61-year-old former United States ambassador to Russia reportedly told journalists this week that Moscow’s role in the ongoing crisis in Ukraine has forced NATO to reconsider the alliance’s opinion on Russia, and that additional troops may soon be mobilized to the region as tensions worsen. </p><p> AP journalist Robert Burns <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/nato-official-russia-now-adversary-150211090--politics.html" target="_blank">wrote</a> on Thursday that Vershbow said the Kremlin’s perceived part in the recent events in Ukraine “<em>marks a turning point in decades of effort by NATO to draw Moscow closer</em>.” </p><p> NATO’s second-in-command reportedly told journalists that the alliance is now considering new measures meant to counter any future acts of aggression on the part of Russia aimed at partner nations, and soon could deploy a larger number of combat forces to Eastern Europe. </p><p> Journalists reporting for <a href="http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27186" target="_blank">Civil.Ge</a> wrote on Thursday that Vershbow told the audience at a panel discussion in Washington, DC one day earlier that NATO should deploy “<em>defensive assets to the region</em>.” </p><p> <em>“We need to step up our support for defense reforms and military modernization of Russia’s neighbors, and not just of Ukraine, but also Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,”</em> Vershbow said, according to the Civil Georgia site. </p><p> NATO should think about “<em>upgrading</em>” joint exercises among partner nations, the site quoted Vershbow as saying during the event, while acknowledging that deploying forces to Georgia would be a “<em>controversial</em>” maneuver. </p><p> <em>“It is also important for the United States to show leadership… to make sure that next steps that NATO will make, for example at the summit in September, will be adequate response to what’s happening in Ukraine,</em>” the Georgian Defense Minister Irakli Alasania said during the discussion. </p><p> <em>“The West should now seize the opportunity and create the reality on the ground by accepting membership of aspirant countries, by putting purely defensive assets in aspirant countries and predominantly in Georgia,”</em> Alasania added. <em>“What is important now is to put some deterrent capabilities on the ground like air defense and anti-armor capabilities that will give us a chance to defend our freedom, because we know that if things go wrong at this point no one is coming to save us; we’ve seen that in 2008.”</em> </p><p> Earlier this week, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the builduip of NATO troops near Russia’s border was “<a href="http://rt.com/news/155476-shoigu-hagel-ukraine-rhetoric/" target="_blank">unprecedented</a>.” Weeks earlier, the US Air Force commander in charge of NATO’s military presence in Europe said that US troops may soon be <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-troops-nato-ukraine-484/" target="_blank">deployed</a> to the region as tensions continue to worsen near the border between Ukraine and Russia. </p><p> For weeks now, officials in Washington and Kiev have claimed that the recent separation of Crimea from Ukraine and the rash of uprisings in the country’s eastern part are the direct result of destabilization efforts spearheaded by Moscow, and both the US and European Union have introduced several rounds of sanctions against Russia as a result. The Kremlin has refuted these claims and rebuffed the sanctions, however, and earlier this week Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin <a href="http://rt.com/news/155732-putin-usa-behind-ukraine-crisis/" target="_blank">accused</a> the White House of orchestrating the Ukrainian crisis. </p><p> <em>“I think what is happening now shows us who really was mastering the process from the beginning. But in the beginning, the United States preferred to remain in the shadow,”</em> Putin said this week<em>.</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
