Social Democrat (SPD) General Secretary Yasmin Fahimi described the comments as repugnant, shocking and completely unacceptable.

These lapses ... not only damage the image of Italy but also endanger the political culture and values of Europe, she told Reuters.

She demanded that conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel respond. Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) are allies of Berlusconi's Forza Italia in the European parliament's European Peoples Party conservative grouping.

CDU General-Secretary Peter Tauber said the comments were so absurd that they don't deserve commenting on.

Berlusconi said on Saturday: According to the Germans, there never were concentration camps.

He caused a storm in 2003 by jokingly offering German Social Democrat Martin Schulz a film part as a concentration camp kapo, or inmate appointed as an overseer.

Social Democrat Schulz told Der Spiegel magazine on Sunday it was also shocking that an Italian sister party of the CDU was campaigning for May's European elections with anti-German slogans, such as More Italy, Less Germany.

Such a slogan is outrageous, he said.

German conservative Herbert Reul also criticized the slogan, saying it was out of order and he could not understand it.

Anti-German rhetoric has been on the rise in Italy and other heavily indebted euro states, since the euro zone crisis led to German demands for economic austerity.

A resolution adopted by the council on Tuesday immediately terminates sanctions imposed in 2005 on diamond imports from the west African nation.

The council noted that the Kimberley Process, the international initiative that regulates the diamond trade, recognised last November that Ivory Coast had fulfilled its diamond certification scheme's minimum requirements.

The Security Council maintained an arms embargo on Ivory Coast until April 30, 2015, with exceptions for the UN peacekeeping mission and disarmament efforts, and a requirement that the Ivorian government get advance UNapproval for any arms shipments. It also maintained financial and travel bans until that date.

After an attempted coup sparked a civil war in 2002, Ivory Coast was split into a rebel-controlled north and government-controlled south.

Hundreds of millions lost

A peace deal in March 2007 brought key rebel leaders into the administration, but deep divisions remained.

The country headed to the brink of civil war in early 2011 when then-president Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede defeat after losing a presidential runoff vote to Alassane Ouattara, who finally became president in May 2011.

Ivory Coast is the world's leading cocoa producer and the world's second-largest producer of cashew nuts.

UN experts have said that hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost from smuggling and illegal dealings in these key commodities as well as timber, oil, gold and diamonds, and a parallel taxation system.

The Security Council called on Ivorian authorities to continue taking measures to dismantle the illegal taxation networks.

It welcomed the government's overall progress towards restoring security, peace and stability, but expressed continued concern about instability in the country's west.

The council commended efforts by Ouattara and his government to stabilise the security situation, accelerate economic development, and strengthen international and regional cooperation, notably with Ghana and Liberia.

It called on all major players in Ivory Coast to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict and urged all illegal Ivorian armed combatants, including in neighboring countries, to lay down their arms immediately.

The council said the government urgently needed to train and equip its security forces, especially the police and gendarmerie, stressing that they must uphold human rights and international law.

The council encouraged Ivory Coast to host a Kimberley Process review of its diamond industry within nine months.

The diamond industry, rights groups, and 75 countries have worked together as members of the Kimberley Process since 2003 to impose requirements on its members to enable them to certify rough diamonds as conflict-free, sothat purchasers can be confident they are not funding violence.

The project was born after wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia that were fuelled by so-called blood diamonds.

Hundreds took part in a march to mark the anniversary of the formation of the Ukrainian SS division, which fought for the Nazi’s against the Soviet Union during World War II, in the city of Lvov in the western Ukraine.


  Around five hundred neo-Nazi supporters took to the streets in
  the center of the city on Sunday to celebrate the creation of the
  14th SS-Volunteer Division ‘Galician’ on April 28, 1943.
  
  Many of the participants wore embroidered national Ukrainian
  shirts and held SS Galician divisional insignias (a yellow lion
  and three crowns on a blue background) in their hands.
  
  The demonstrators made their way from the monument to the
  Ukrainian nationalist icon of Stepan Bandera, and to the local
  cemetery where a memorial to the Galician soldiers is erected.



  Bandera was the head of the Organization of Ukrainian
  Nationalists (OUN), which collaborated with Nazi Germany, and was
  involved in the ethnic cleansing of Poles, Jews and Russians.
  
  The action went on despite calls from the local administration to
  abstain from public gatherings on the day as it “may harm the
  unity of the country.”


  The march was staged by ‘Native Land’ and ‘Student Brotherhood of
  Stepan Bandera’ – radical organizations, supported by local
  motorcycle enthusiasts.



  Despite the organizers promising that the rally would be a silent
  one, there were a lot of nationalist chants heard in Lvov.
  
  However, slogans like – “SS Galician Division!” “People of
  Lvov are the strongest!”“Glory to the nation – death to
  enemies!” and “Bandera and Shukhevich are heroes of
  Ukraine!” – weren’t welcomed by many of the city’s
  residents, the UNIAN news agency reports.
  
  It resulted in the route of the march being shortened and the
  organizers apologizing to those who were offended by the chants.



  Around two hundred policemen provided security during the march,
  which proceeded without serious violations of public order.
  
  None of the actual participants of the SS Galician Division were
  noticed taking part in the action, RIA-Novosti reports.
  
  The Nazi occupational forces picked the SS Galician Division from
  volunteers in western Ukraine in order to tackle Soviet and
  Polish partisans.



  The military formation, which became well-known for its ferocity,
  existed for over a year before being crushed by the Red Army in
  July 1944.
  
  During the Nuremberg trials, all those who were officially
  acknowledged as SS members were labeled war criminals, and the
  Nazi organization itself was banned.","Neo-Nazis march in Lvov 'in honor' of Ukrainian Waffen SS division (PHOTOS)

But somewhat lost in the headlines was another interesting wrinkle: Following meetings in Seoul, it emerged that Washington was possibly going to postpone its planned handover of wartime command of South Korea's forces, which had been slated for 2015.

Wait, you say. The U.S. commands the South Korean military? Yes and no.

Since 1994, South Korea has retained peacetime control over its armed forces. But in the event of conflict breaking out, most probably with neighboring pariah state and regional irritant North Korea, the U.S. would assume operational control — known as OPCON in military jargon — over the South's armed forces. It's a relic of the uneasy armistice that ended the Korean War six decades ago and has led to a permanent U.S. troop presence on the peninsula ever since (some 28,500 soldiers). If the North attacks, the U.S. must take the lead to battle its Cold War foe.

The new delay in the proposed handover is largely a result of South Korean skittishness — as my colleague Craig Whitlock reported last September — in the face of the North's increasingly erratic, bellicose behavior under its young leader Kim Jong Un. While the South Korean army is more than a match for that of the North, the U.S. military is better equipped to deal with an enemy that possesses the nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities North Korea is believed to have in its arsenal. Here's Whitlock:

South Korean officials began a public campaign this summer for a delay beyond 2015 but haven't specified a new date. U.S. officials have not agreed to any changes. Some have said they are becoming frustrated with South Korea’s reluctance to take charge of its own defense ...In February [2013], North Korea conducted a nuclear test, two months after testing a long-range ballistic missile that could strike the western United States. Memories are also fresh here of a March 2010 incident in which North Korea torpedoed a South Korean naval vessel, killing 46 sailors.

Responding to South Korean angst, felt most keenly by the conservatives currently in power in Seoul, Obama offered assurances that the U.S. would perhaps not be transferring its wartime command so soon. Given the evolving security environment in the region, including the enduring North Korean nuclear missile threat, we can reconsider the 2015 timeline, said Obama at a news conference alongside South Korean President Park Geun-hye.

Of course, not all South Koreans want the U.S. to retain these wartime powers. In most other circumstances, no sovereign nation would cede such authority to another state. Robert E. Kelly, assistant professor of international relations at Pusan National University  in South Korea, offers a good explanation of the politics of OPCON here. The first handover, planned for 2012, had been demanded by a progressive government in Seoul in 2006. Subsequent conservative administrations now keep pushing back the date. Kelly outlines the contours of the domestic debate in South Korea:

[U.S. wartime command] smacks of neocolonialism and external control. The Korean left in particular has long been uncomfortable with the U.S. presence. Like many Western European leftist parties during the Cold War, the South Korean left is deeply divided over how to approach the communists. A minority could be fairly described as “pro-Pyongyang”... More generally, there is some confused sympathy for the North’s goals and a strong willingness to blame the Americans for making North Korea so paranoid and awful. Where conservatives tend to see a megalomaniacal, out-of-control monarchy, progressives tend to see North Korea pushed into harshness by U.S. imperialism. Hence a reversion of OPCON could reduce tensions by reducing the Northern perception that the U.S. is out to get it.

One can imagine that many in the U.S. would welcome not having to shoulder such a burden on the other side of the planet. But even as American troops prepare to pull out of Afghanistan later this year, the frozen, intractable Korean conflict grinds on.","During the first two legs of his Asia tour, at stops in Japan and South Korea, President Obama paid tribute to those who died in the tragic Sewol ferry disaster, sought to offer support to Asian allies in the face of external threats (read: North Korea and, to a lesser extent, China) and found time to kick a soccer ball around with a robot.

Amid Kiev’s info war branding Slavyansk civilians “hostages of the terrorists,” the residents of Slavyansk speak out against the military campaign in eastern Ukraine and go out to block troops and APCs, as self-defense vows to “stand to the last.”


  Expecting a fresh wave of assaults from armed forces loyal to
  Kiev to start at any moment, the defiant anti-government
  stronghold of Slavyansk has become “eerily quiet,” with
  the streets, dotted with checkpoints, practically devoid of
  passersby. These are the impressions of RT’s Paula Slier

  Slier, who witnessed the scenes in the city amid Friday’s ongoing
  military offensive on its outskirts, reported
  that some locals had gathered in central Slavyansk, determined to
  “defend the city,” while others were stationed on roads
  and bridges leading into Slavyansk to prevent military hardware
  from entering the city. All this was going on while the Ukrainian
  Interior Ministry kept urging people to stay at home so as not to
  become “shields for terrorists.”


  In the nearby village of Andreevka, at least 15 armored vehicles
  were blocked by the locals at a time when other units loyal to
  Kiev were storming the outermost self-defense checkpoints. A
  YouTube video from Yasnogorka showed a man, who was reportedly
  run over by an APC while fruitlessly trying to block its way.

  For those living in Slavyansk, Friday morning began with the
  sound of a warning siren and fears of army assaults and shelling
  of the city. Several Ukrainian army helicopters, supporting
  ground troops with missile fire, were reportedly shot down near Slavyansk by armed
  self-defense units. Footage showed an injured helicopter pilot
  who survived crashing, but was “left to die” by the
  retreating Ukrainian troops, according to Slavyansk activists.

Amid Kiev’s info war branding Slavyansk civilians “hostages of the terrorists,” the residents of Slavyansk speak out against the military campaign in eastern Ukraine and go out to block troops and APCs, as self-defense vows to “stand to the last.”


  Expecting a fresh wave of assaults from armed forces loyal to
  Kiev to start at any moment, the defiant anti-government
  stronghold of Slavyansk has become “eerily quiet,” with
  the streets, dotted with checkpoints, practically devoid of
  passersby. These are the impressions of RT’s Paula Slier

  Slier, who witnessed the scenes in the city amid Friday’s ongoing
  military offensive on its outskirts, reported
  that some locals had gathered in central Slavyansk, determined to
  “defend the city,” while others were stationed on roads
  and bridges leading into Slavyansk to prevent military hardware
  from entering the city. All this was going on while the Ukrainian
  Interior Ministry kept urging people to stay at home so as not to
  become “shields for terrorists.”


  In the nearby village of Andreevka, at least 15 armored vehicles
  were blocked by the locals at a time when other units loyal to
  Kiev were storming the outermost self-defense checkpoints. A
  YouTube video from Yasnogorka showed a man, who was reportedly
  run over by an APC while fruitlessly trying to block its way.

  For those living in Slavyansk, Friday morning began with the
  sound of a warning siren and fears of army assaults and shelling
  of the city. Several Ukrainian army helicopters, supporting
  ground troops with missile fire, were reportedly shot down near Slavyansk by armed
  self-defense units. Footage showed an injured helicopter pilot
  who survived crashing, but was “left to die” by the
  retreating Ukrainian troops, according to Slavyansk activists.
  The man was then helped by his own “adversaries” as they brought
  him to the city for medical treatment.

The Polish capital Warsaw will on Friday host three-party talks involving representatives of Russia, Ukraine and the European Commission on gas supply issues.

Russia will be represented by Energy Minister Alexander Novak, Ukraine by Ukrainian parliament-appointed Energy and Coal Industry Minister Yury Prodan, and the European Commission by European Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger.

According to the Russian Energy Ministry, the meeting will be devoted to “the search of a way out of the crisis situation connected with Ukraine’s payments for Russian gas.

The Russian delegation comprises Russian state energy giant Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller, representatives of the Foreign, Finance and Economic Development ministries, as well as a group of experts.

“Implementation of a contract to supply Russian gas to Ukraine, measures to ensure transit to Europe, as well as the issue of payment by the Ukrainian side of the cost of supplied gas in the context of the financial and economic situation in that country will be discussed at the talks,” the Russian Energy Ministry said.

According to Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian side proposed holding such three-party consultations “to discuss the critical situation in the Ukrainian energy sector” on April 24, and then on April 28, but “Brussels was not ready for them” then. He said Moscow is set for “deep discussions of the entire situation in the energy sphere”.

Prior to the three-sided meeting in Warsaw, Oettinger will also meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Their talks will focus on the Poland-promoted initiative of a European energy union, whose key aim is to reduce the European Union’s dependence on Russian gas deliveries and to strengthen Europe’s positions in talks with Gazprom.

According to the Polish head of government, “the EU is concerned about what will happen to gas that should pass via Ukraine’s territory to those who bought the gas in line with mid- and long-term contracts”.

“Gas storage facilities in Ukraine are not full, and everyone is already thinking about winter,” he said. “In the conditions of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, Europe is considering how the gas will get to Europe despite the current situation. We don’t have a fully alternative source [of gas supplies] yet.”

On Wednesday, Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov told journalists that Ukraine’s overall debt for Russian gas grew to about $3.5 billion. “Taking into account the request by [Ukraine’s national oil and gas company] Naftogaz Ukrainy for April 30 add the volumes that we have already supplied that month, the overall debt of Ukraine for Russian gas preliminarily stands at $3.492 billion,” he said.

As of April 26, Naftogaz imported some 2.25 billion cubic meters of Russian gas worth $1.09 billion. For the remaining days, the requested import was 110 million cubic meters daily. So, Ukraine was due to import in April 2.7 billion cu m of gas. By May 1, Naftogaz’s debt grows by $1.3 billion to about $3.5 billion with the gas price standing at $485.5 per 1,000 cu m.

The European Commission earlier said it is ready to help Ukraine pay off its gas debt. But Prodan has not yet expressed readiness to pay for gas supplied by Gazprom.

On April 28, Ukrainian parliament-appointed prime minister Arseny Yatsenyuk reported that the government made the decision to start the procedure of suing Gazprom. He said “Ukraine is ready to pay $268 per 1,000 cu m of gas, and if Russia gives a positive answer on the price and extends the contract, Ukraine will without delay pay off its $2.2 billion debt to Gazprom”.

“Ukraine is awaiting a reply from Gazprom for 30 days, otherwise, [the country] will sue [Gazprom] in Stockholm,” Yatsenyuk said.

Also on April 28, Ukraine and Slovakia signed in Bratislava a memorandum of intent on organizing reverse supplies of gas to Ukraine. In line with the reached agreements, from October, supplies to Ukraine will total 3.2 billion cubic meters annually. In 2015, the volume may grow to 10 billion cu m.

The sides also agreed that they will consider whether it will be possible to organize reverse supplies via the transit pipe via which the Russian gas is delivered to Europe.

Meanwhile, the gas reverse agreement with Slovakia will not allow Ukraine to stop purchasing Russian gas. Internal consumption of gas in Ukraine totals 50 billion cu m annually, with its own production accounting for slightly less than a half.

The deal with Slovakia envisions reverse deliveries of 3.2 billion cu m, and a deal with Germany’s RWE on reverse gas supplies from Poland stipulates deliveries of 1.5 billion cu m. Possible reverse deliveries from Hungary can reach 5 billion cu m. Thus, Ukraine can only cover a third of its Russian gas imports due to supplies from Europe.

RUSSIAN GAS PRICE CHANGE FOR KIEV

Moscow recently substantially raised the price for gas supplied to Ukraine from the figure of $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters agreed last year when an association agreement with the EU was shelved in November 2013.

In the second quarter of 2014, the price for Russian gas for Ukraine was set at $385.5 per 1,000 cu m. Gazprom said earlier that the price rose from $268.5 due to the return to earlier contract agreements, as Ukraine failed to fulfill its commitments under an additional agreement concluded in December 2013, which obliged the country to pay for supplied volumes of Russian gas in time.

On April 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on denunciation of the Kharkov Accords with Ukraine, which were struck in 2010 and stipulated that Russia’s lease of naval facilities in Crimea [then part of Ukraine] would be extended by 25 years beyond 2017 - until 2042.

The Kharkov deals envisioned a discount of $100 per 1,000 cu m on Russian gas for Kiev. Now that the accords have been denounced due to Crimea’s accession to the Russian Federation, the discount will no longer be applied, raising the gas price by another $100 to $485.5 per 1,000 cu m, which is expected to make the economic situation in Ukraine even more complicated.

CRISIS IN UKRAINE

Ukraine is in political and economic turmoil following a coup that occurred in the country in February after months of anti-government protests triggered by Kiev’s decision to suspend an association agreement with the EU in November 2013 to study the deal more thoroughly.

New people were brought to power in Kiev amid deadly riots that involved radicals after President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns in February 2014. Russia does not recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, who appear unable to restrain ultranationalists and radicals.

Ukraine’s crisis soured further when the Republic of Crimea, where most residents are Russians, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new self-proclaimed Ukrainian leadership. Crimea held a referendum March 16 in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and reunify with the Russian Federation. The accession deal with Moscow was signed two days later.

Kiev and Western nations do not recognize Crimea’s reunification with Russia despite Moscow's repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite conformed to the international law and the UN Charter and was in line with the precedent set by Kosovo’s secession from Serbia in 2008.

Some Russian and Crimean officials and companies have been subjected to sanctions by Western nations after Crimea’s incorporation by Russia. Russia has also taken some limited punitive actions in response.

The West has threatened Russia with new economic penalties unless the country changes its foreign policy, but Moscow has dismissed the unfriendly measures saying the language of sanctions is counterproductive and will have a boomerang effect on Western nations.

After Crimea’s accession to Russia, protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeastern territories, with demonstrators demanding referendums on the country’s federalization and taking control of some government buildings.

Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim head of state Alexander Turchinov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region in eastern Ukraine.

The new round of U.S. sanctions, following those imposed last month when Russia annexed Crimea, barely registered in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow rebels were holding a group of German and other OSCE military observers for a fourth day.

Despite a Ukrainian military operation to contain them, the militants extended their grip by seizing key public buildings in another town in the Donetsk region. In the regional capital, Donetsk, club-wielding pro-Russian activists broke up a rally by supporters of the Western-backed government in Kiev.

The high-profile mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, was badly wounded by a gunman, raising fears of further unrest in a Russian-speaking region that has seen less trouble of late than the neighboring provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.

U.S. sanctions were aimed, Washington officials said, at cronies of Putin. Seven men, including Sechin, were targeted by visa bans and freezing of any U.S. assets, and 17 companies were also named.

The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally, Obama said. The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.

Washington will also deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities and revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions, the White House said.

In addition to Sechin, the Russians sanctioned by the United States included another Putin ally, Sergei Chemezov, head of Rostec, a Russian state-owned high-tech products company.

The others named were Oleg Belavencev, Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea, Dmitry Kozak, deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, Evgeniy Murov, director of Russia's federal protective service, Aleksei Pushkov, a state Duma deputy, and Vyacheslav Volodin, a Putin adviser.

Not included was Gazprom chief Alexei Miller, a close ally of Putin who had been seen as a possible target.

Obama is under pressure from opposition Republicans at home to move faster on sanctions. But in taking what he described as calibrated steps, he has emphasized a need to act in concert with European countries, which have more at stake economically and a more cumbersome process for taking decisions.

There was little prospect of a change in the calculus for Putin, who critics say is stirring up fear among ethnic Russians in order to redraw post-Soviet borders and rebuild Moscow's empire.

Washington is in effect reviving ... an old method of restricting normal cooperation, from Cold War times, essentially chasing itself into a dark, dusty closet of a bygone era, said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, describing the sanctions as illegitimate, uncivilized and in breach of international law.

In an hour-long phone call with U.S. Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu voiced concern about an unprecedented increase in U.S. and NATO activity near Russia's borders and urged Hagel to help turn down the rhetoric over Ukraine, Moscow's Defense Ministry said.

RALLY ATTACKED

Both sides continue to offer diametrically mirror-image versions of events in Ukraine. The West sees the pro-Western leaders who took power after Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovich fled to Russia in February as legitimate and believes Putin is trying to undermine their efforts to hold an election.

For Moscow, they are fascists and putschists, anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalists against whom the Russian speakers of Crimea and the east have risen up in self-defence - a view it broadcasts into Ukraine on state-run Russian media.

Opinion polls show substantial but still only minority support in the depressed, industrial east of Ukraine for it to follow Crimea into union with Russia.

Several people were injured on Monday after dozens of men in military fatigues, carrying baseball bats and throwing firecrackers, tried to break up a demonstration in Donetsk.

A crowd of about 2,000 waved Ukrainian flags and chanted: Donetsk is Ukraine and Putin, no, but they dispersed after the assault, in which Reuters journalists saw at least 10 people treated for head injuries.

Earlier in the same region, armed men in camouflage who refused to identify themselves seized the police station and town hall in Kostyantynivka. Reuters journalists saw about 20 well-organized gunmen controlling the administration building. They erected a barricade of tires, sandbags and concrete blocks.

Soviet songs played over loudspeakers, and women gathered signatures in support of an uprising against rule from Kiev.

Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, a colorful and well-known figure nationwide, was shot in the back while out exercising, and doctors are battling to save his life. Kernes, 54, is a member of the party through which Yanukovich and fellow easterners had dominated a Ukrainian system widely seen as deeply corrupt.

Among the most prominent Jewish politicians in the country who earned his wealth from business dealings in the crime-ridden 1990s, Kernes had called for Kharkiv to quit Ukraine after Yanukovich fell, but had lately clamped down on separatists. The government said police were looking into whether the assassination attempt was linked to the arrest of pro-Russian separatists on Sunday.

GERMAN HOSTAGES

Although Russia signed a deal with Ukraine and Kiev's U.S. and EU allies at Geneva 10 days ago under which militants should surrender to OSCE monitors, it flatly denies Ukrainian and Western assertions it is controlling the militants' activities and that it has special forces orchestrating events on the ground.

Russia's involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable, a White House statement said.

After an appeal from Germany, long Moscow's firmest advocate in the West, for Russia to intervene to secure the release of the seven European monitors, four of whom are German, Moscow's ambassador to the OSCE said it would be good if they were freed.

But he also condemned the OSCE, of which Russia is a member, for being extremely irresponsible in sending them to eastern Ukraine. Moscow has condemned the Kiev authorities for failing to provide security in the industrial and heavily populated east, close to the Russian border.

In the face of Western and Ukrainian calls for it to pull back troops massed on Ukraine's frontier, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday it had deep concern about forces Kiev has sent to the region, suggesting that Ukrainian troops might be preparing for the destruction of entire cities.

In the separatist military stronghold at Slaviansk, the self-declared mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said he had given OSCE mediators a list of detainees his movement wanted freed by Kiev in return for the OSCE observers he is holding.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said the jailed leader of an earlier separatist protest in Donetsk was on hunger strike to protest against his torture. It also cited reports that Ukraine was building detention centers very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps for dissenting citizens in the east.

The Moscow stock market shrugged off the sanctions, rising almost 1 percent when they failed to penalize more companies.

Although its chief executive, Sechin, was hit by a visa ban, few expected Rosneft or its international partners to suffer much, though its shares lost 1.7 percent on the day.

Western countries say sanctions are already having an effect on Russia by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The central bank has raised interest rates to support the ruble, and Russian firms are finding it harder to raise funds.

Ukraine has no right to revise the price of gas from Russia unilaterally, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Saturday, May 3.

He said the issue of gas price had been raised by the Ukrainian delegation at the trilateral consultations in Warsaw on May 2. “We did not want to discuss this issue at the consultations because we think that there are no grounds for discussing it,” Novak said.

He recalled that the contract signed 2009 was still in force. “The contract has been in effect for five years and has been implemented. Ukrainian Energy and Coal Industry Minister Yuri Prodan reaffirmed this yesterday,” he said.

Under the contract, the price of gas supplied to Ukraine is determined by the formula that is pegged to the price of oil. “This formula is used everywhere in the world for pipeline gas supplies. Therefore there are no grounds to discuss the price today and especially unilaterally offer the first quarter price of 268 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres as the Ukrainian authorities are doing,” Novak said.

Parliament-appointed acting President Alexander Turchinov on May 1 instructed the Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry to secure gas supplies from Russia at the price that was in effect in February and March 2014.

If Russia disagrees to meet the demand, the relevant Ukrainian ministries and agencies have been instructed to “file a corresponding lawsuit with an international court of arbitration within a month of the receipt of the notice”.

Ukraine’s overall debt for Russian gas has grown to 3.492 billion U.S. dollars, Gazprom spokesperson Sergei Kupriyanov said on April 30.

“Considering Naftogaz of Ukraine’s request for April 30 and the volumes we have already delivered this month [in April], Ukraine’s overall debt for Russian gas, according to preliminary estimates, will be 3.492 billion U.S. dollars,” he said.

The overall amount of gas imported by Ukraine in April was 2.7 billion cubic metres. With the price of 485.5 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres, Ukraine’s debt had increased by 1.3 billion U.S. dollars by May 1 and reached 3.5 billion U.S. dollars.

Prodan said Ukraine was ready to pay its debt to Russia’s Gazprom for gas supplies at a price of 268.5 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres.

“Ukraine is ready to pay the debt. But we cannot pay the price Gazprom set from April 1. It is unjustifiably high and is about 500 U.S. dollars. We are ready to pay under our obligations,” the minister said.

He disagreed with price of gas set by Gazprom which put Ukraine’s debt for gas at 3.5 billion U.S. dollars.

Parliament-appointed Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also reiterated that Ukraine was prepared to pay the price of 268 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres of Russian gas.

This is 45% below the established price of gas. If Moscow disagrees, Kiev will be prepared to contest its debt in court, he said.

Yatsenyuk told reporters that a “note” had been sent to Russia’s Gazprom, which “states the price”. If Gazprom accepts the proposed terms, Ukraine will pay the gas debt of 2.2 billion U.S. dollars immediately. If no solution is found within 30 days, the dispute will be taken to court.

“We have come to agreement on a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the EU and Russia to settle the gas conflict. But I would like to recall that Ukraine has sent a pre-arbitration claim to Gazprom. If the positions are not reconciled and Ukraine’s demands are not met within 29 days, we will meet in Stockholm’s international court of arbitration,” he said.

“The government invites Gazprom to meet on neutral ground in London and discuss all issues. We will defend the interests of Ukraine using all lawful methods and the best lawful method is the court in Stockholm,” Yatsenyuk said.

Russia abolished the zero duty on gas for Ukraine on April 3, which automatically raised the price of gas for Ukraine from April 2014 to 485 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres, an increase of more than 200 U.S. dollars from the price that was used until then.

In December 2013, Russian Gazprom and Naftogaz Ukrainy signed an addendum to the gas agreement in effect from January 19, 2009, under which the price of Russian natural gas for Ukraine was to be reduced by one-third to 268.5 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres from January 1, 2014, compared to 410 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Moscow and Kiev also agreed that the discount would remain in effect as long as the key conditions were met, specifically timely payments for current supplies and repayment of debts.

At the end of the first quarter of 2014, Gazprom said it would have to raise the price of gas for Ukraine by more than 100 U.S. dollars to 385.5 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres because Ukraine had failed to pay the debt for the gas delivered in 2013 and had not made payments for current supplies.","MOSCOW, May 03. /ITAR-TASS/.

Click here for times, videos and features

(CNN) -- At first glance, Sergei Baltacha doesn't exactly look like a man of international sporting history.

Tall, slim and stylishly dressed, the 56-year-old appears to have more in common with a graphic designer or university professor than a globally renowned footballer.

But make no mistake -- this is a man who has represented the USSR at a World Cup and a European Championships before breaking through football's Iron Curtain to become the first player from the Soviet Union to play for an English club.

Baltacha, who hails from Ukraine (then part of the USSR and currently a country in political and social turmoil), was a cultured, yet physically tough defender and sweeper who made 300 appearances for Dynamo Kiev and earned 49 caps for the Soviet Union.

He eventually brought his steely Soviet style to English league side Ipswich Town, blazing a trail for the likes of Georgi Kinkladze, Dmitri Kharine and Andrei Arshavin in the process.

It was interesting because it was 1988 and at that time it started to be the history of Gorbachov, of glasnost and perestroika, Baltacha said of the circumstances that surrounded his signing for The Tractor Boys in 1988.

There was interest from some Italian clubs, some from Switzerland (but) first time when I heard about Ipswich I wouldn't choose any other team because for me English football is everything.

I left everything that we have over there (in the USSR). When we got all the papers, passports, we flew and we started for two years to live here.

Pitching up near the Norfolk coast was a far cry from the regimented footballing education Baltacha received back home, however.

Strategy and attitudes to sport were far more sophisticated in his homeland than in England where a hard-drinking culture was still prevalent amongst players at many leading football clubs.

Early days

Baltacha had learned at the feet of Valeriy Lobanovskyi after all, a Dynamo Kiev hero and one of the most vaunted footballing coaches of the 20th century.

Lobanovskyi was famed for his scientific focus on conditioning and no little tactical nous. He was also one of the first coaches to harness the power of computer technology to track performance levels and simulate game scenarios.

Athletic and intelligent, the young Baltacha had the raw materials to succeed in the rigorous Lobanovskyi program.

He was spotted by the Dynamo boss while still a teenager at the Kharkiv academy of footballing excellence which he had left home to attend at the age of 13.

By 1976 an offer to turn professional was on the table from Kiev. Dynamo had won the European Cup Winners' Cup one year previously, becoming the first club side from the USSR to lift a major continental trophy.

The decision to accept was not a difficult one.

I joined Dynamo Kiev and it was huge club, huge competition, and you play each game in front of 100,000 people. It's something special, Baltacha said of his time in the Ukrainian capital.

Kiev was one of the best in Europe from the content of coaching, from facilities, its a premier ground, the analysis, the background of teams.

Even when I came (to England) after I played for Dynamo twelve years (later), the clubs did not do that kind of work that we had at Kiev.

This meticulous approach was something that would filter its way into the USSR national team after Lobonovskyi took charge for two spells during the 1980s.

Dynamo Kiev was the best side in Russia at the time. (We had) maybe 12, 14 or 15 or sometimes even 17 people who represented national team, Baltacha said.

But (we would) still be very friendly with other players from other clubs. We had unity which I think maybe was a strength of ours. (We were) like brothers and it really helped us.

International stage

This promising group of players would go on to star at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, the 1982 World Cup in Spain and the European Championships in Germany six years later.

The Soviets would reach the final of Euro 88 where they would lose to a Marco van Basten inspired Holland.

For football geeks, the game played at Munich's Olympic Stadium represented a heavyweight clash of footballing philosophies -- the scientific approach of Lobanovskyi against the total football ideals of Dutch manager Rinus Michels.

Lobanovskyi's Soviet side had beaten Holland 1-0 in the group stages earlier in the tournament, but Michels would get his revenge in the final thanks to a goal from Ruud Gullit and a wonder volley from van Basten.

Baltacha was injured for much of the tournament, however, and only managed to make an appearance in the final as a substitute after his side had gone 2-0 down.

It is for this reason he holds fonder memories of the 1982 World Cup in Spain. Although the Soviets were knocked out in the second stage, Baltacha was a key player at the heart of the USSR defense.

(The) World Cup in Spain was like dream come true for me, Baltacha said. I could not wait. I remember each game, like I could not sleep before game because you want to step up on football pitch.

You're going to bed like maybe ten o'clock in evening and you're thinking about game. You're focusing. You're thinking about what can be happening. You're thinking and you're so excited you look at clock and it's (already) three o'clock morning, he laughingly adds.

Despite the Soviet's early exit, Baltacha regards the '82 World Cup as one of his proudest moments. He even scored a rare goal in the group stages against New Zealand.

A lot of players will play in World Cup as forwards who never score and I was (a) center defender and I scored this goal. It's like a dream you know. This is the most memorable memory of all, it was fantastic.

Other favored memories of this tournament include playing against Brazilian legends of the game such as Socrates, ?der and Zico.

I will never forget (that) game against Brazil when we played in against ?der and Zico. The two of them (scored) in the last ten minutes and we lost 2-1, he said.

Foreign travels

Baltacha began his British sojourn following his final international appearance in 1988.

After two seasons at Ipswich, he headed north of the border to Scotland, spending three years at St Johnstone before going on to manage Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Today, Baltacha spends his time coaching promising youngsters at English Championship side Charlton Athletic.

Pitching up at such comparative footballing outposts was a far cry from his days at the pinnacle of European football but his family had settled in the UK.

After ten years you realize kids grow up ... you realize you have your house here, your home here, your land here ... you are more than 15 years here and its how it happened?

His son, Sergei Junior, was a promising footballer before injury curtailed his career.

Daughter Elena, meanwhile, became a professional tennis player, reaching the number No. 1 ranking in Britain and breaking into the world's top 50.

But tragedy struck earlier this year when she was diagnosed with liver cancer. Like her father, however, aggression in the face of adversity is a trait the now 30-year-old Elena has in spades.

She was fighter during her days in sport and she is a fighter now, he said.

I would like to say thanks to everyone who is support(ing) us, sending message, emails, calling us to give us support or offer any advice or you know.

Most importantly we are all together, fighting all together.

Sage words from a man who made a sporting career out of just such a philosophy.

The Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) said the Kiev authorities were committing war crimes and therefore must face a military tribunal.

“I think this is an organised criminal group that has been acting like this since the very beginning, committing war crimes. For these atrocities they must be brought to justice as war criminals and they must be tried by an international military tribunal,” Irina Yarovaya, chair of the Duma Security Committee, said on Saturday, May 3.

She believes that any support for ‘the self-proclaimed Kiev authorities who ordered the extermination of their own people means compliance in this mass killing of people”.

Duma Deputy Speaker Sergei Neverov is convinced that “there is no justification” for what happened in Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and Odessa in Ukraine.

“It’s awful that the unleashing of civil war Ukraine is supported by the West that in no time has forgotten human rights and democratic values, of which EU countries and the United States claimed to be the advocates. Now no one has any doubt as to who is sponsoring unrests in Ukraine and who sponsored them from the start,” he said.

“I do hope quite sincerely that last night’s tragedy will make those who support the illegitimate and criminal regime come to their senses although the chances of that are waning, judging from the reaction of Western politicians,” Neverov said. “Instead of defending peaceful citizens of Ukraine, they are blocking Russian proposals in the U.N. Security Council, which are aimed at peaceful resolution of the issue. The West is conniving at the Ukrainian radicals and Nazi whose ideology is extermination. Apparently Europe has learnt no bitter lessons from last century.”

Frants Klintsevich, deputy chair of the Duma Defence Committee, drew historical parallels with the current events in Ukraine.

“The European Union and America refuse to understand the explosive situation in Ukraine and do not want to figure out what is good and what is bad because they simply can’t benefit from that. They want a civil war,” he said.

Klintsevich recalled that “during the Great Patriotic War [1941-1945], SS battalions manned with Ukrainian nationalists commanded by fascists destroyed the village of Khatyn in Belarus, burning the elderly, women and children alive”.

“Practically 70 years on, the decedents of those fascists did the same. They blocked people inside the Trade Union House and set it on fire,” he said.

“Why does Europe support such atrocities?” the MP asked.

He stressed that all opposition parties in “enlightened Europe” and the whole world must know what “present-day fascists” did in Odessa.

Chairman of the State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs and Ties with Compatriots Leonid Slutsky said the bloodbath in Odessa on May 2 “completely destroys the Geneva accords and incites a civil war in Ukraine”.

“What happened, especially the fire in the Trade Union House, reminds me of the Nazi crimes during World War II. This is a new Khatyn and Auschwitz,” he said.

“Especially outrageous is the benevolent reaction of the West to the crimes committed by the Kiev authorities against their own people,” he said, and stressed that “violence must be condemned and stopped”.

Mikhail Starshinov, head of the inter-faction group for interaction between civil society institutions and law enforcement agencies, condemned the Ukrainian Interior Ministry’s statement that the Trade Union House in Odessa had been set on fire by the activists who had seized it.

“By the degree of cynicism, this statement is beyond the good and the bad,” he said. “This is yet another evidence that certain political forces in the world will stop at nothing in a bid to achieve their goals.”

He stressed that Russia was trying to conduct a dialogue on the settlement of the situation in Ukraine at all levels, including the Foreign Ministry and parliament. “However our opponents remain deaf to reasonable proposals on how to de-escalate violence. As a result, innocent people died,” Starshinov said, adding that “this scenario would have been unheard of two months ago”.

Unrests erupted on Friday, May 2, with a mass fight started by football fans from Kharkov, Right Sector radicals and members of the so-called “Maidan self-defence” force from Kiev, who had decided to march along the streets of Odessa, thus provoking clashes with the supporters of Ukraine’s federalisation. As a result, 46 people had been killed in the clashes and over 200 had requested medical attention.

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said the building had been set on fire by the same people who had seized it. However this disagrees with the footage and eye-witness reports from the scene.","MOSCOW, May 03. /ITAR-TASS/.

“By the degree of cynicism, this statement is beyond the good and the bad,” he said. “This is yet another evidence that certain political forces in the world will stop at nothing in a bid to achieve their goals.”

He stressed that Russia was trying to conduct a dialogue on the settlement of the situation in Ukraine at all levels, including the Foreign Ministry and parliament. “However our opponents remain deaf to reasonable proposals on how to de-escalate violence. As a result, innocent people died,” Starshinov said, adding that “this scenario would have been unheard of two months ago”.

Unrests erupted on Friday, May 2, with a mass fight started by football fans from Kharkov, Right Sector radicals and members of the so-called “Maidan self-defence” force from Kiev, who had decided to march along the streets of Odessa, thus provoking clashes with the supporters of Ukraine’s federalisation. As a result, 46 people had been killed in the clashes and over 200 had requested medical attention.

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said the building had been set on fire by the same people who had seized it. However this disagrees with the footage and eye-witness reports from the scene.",871

Obama made his first stop in Tokyo on a weeklong tour that will also take him to South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met over what's been described as the world's best sushi at Sukiyabashi Jiro, a top-rated restaurant in the Ginza district. The dinner also brought out the new U.S. ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy.

On Thursday, Obama will start a formal state visit to the nation -- the highest designation for a foreign leader.

Obama's appearances in Japan will be tinged with formality — meetings with the royal family, a stop at the Meiji shrine and a protocol-bound state dinner.

Japan's first state visit by an American president in almost two decades comes as the United States works to reassure Abe and other Asian leaders that the United States remains committed to turning foreign policy focus on them.

The pivot to Asia that began almost three years ago meant to put a greater emphasis on diplomatic and economic efforts toward Pacific nations to counterbalance China's influence in the region.

Obama begins Asia trip with 'the best sushi I've ever had'

But Middle East uprisings, the Syrian civil war and new diplomacy with Iran have made some Asian leaders wonder when the pivot would take shape.

At the start of his long-awaited visit, Obama waded into a fraught territorial dispute between Japan and China.

He told a Japanese newspaper that a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing fall within the scope of a U.S.-Japanese security treaty, implying the United States could step in militarily in the event of a clash over the territory.

It's the first time an incumbent U.S. President has made such a statement on the bitterly disputed islands, and comes as Asian nations nervously watch the U.S. response to Russia's incursion into Ukraine.

Japan has eyed the Ukraine situation closely. Obama's comments Wednesday should dispel at least some of its worry.

We oppose any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan's administration of these islands, Obama said in answers to questions submitted by the Yomiuri Shimbun.

Both Tokyo and Beijing say the islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, are an inherent part of their territory. Taiwan, which lies 120 miles (about 190 kilometers) southwest of the islands, also stakes a claim to them.

Obama's words, reiterating statements made in previous years by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, drew a swift rebuke from Beijing.

The United States should respect the truth, not take any sides, be careful about its words and behavior, and uphold peace and stability, said Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

But Obama's comments are likely to provide some reassurance to Japan. The Chinese government has stepped up efforts in recent years to challenge Japan's control of the small, rocky islands and the waters and airspace around them.

Obama's efforts to reassure Asian allies also extend to his push for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade deal the White House hopes will open economic channels in the region.

In the works for years, the Japan portion of the trade deal is not expected to be finalized this week -- due to disagreements between the United States and Japan, and a delay in Congress from members of Obama's party.

The resistance to approving the trade deal, along with another trade pact being negotiated with Europe, stems from Democrats' worry the agreements would kill jobs. They're not likely to come on board at least until November's midterm elections.

The President has developed credibility problems in terms of delivering on the congressional support, said Kenneth Lieberthal, who handled Asia policy in Bill Clinton's White House and now acts as a senior fellow at Brookings Institution.

My own sense is ... that there's less confidence that the President has (been) effective in dealing with the Congress and that may really be a major issue in finalizing (the trade deal).

Despite the stalemate, U.S. officials have remained bullish the deal would be good for the U.S. economy.

This remains a very important aspect of our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, one that holds great promise for the countries in the region as well as for the United States, Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, said last week. We'll continue to work toward that given its significance to all concerned.

The report interviewed 320 people, including a number of survivors from the notorious secret political system, and concluded that the country was committing human rights violations “without any parallel in the contemporary world.”

So how did North Korea respond? With indignant anger. For weeks now, North Korean state media have been offering various retorts to the United Nations. In April, a North Korean spokesman argued that the United States and its allies were running a human rights racket. Then, a few weeks later, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) published a commentary questioning how a gay man could lead an investigation into human rights.

This week, however, North Korea unveiled a new strategy: Releasing its own human rights reports on the West.

On Wednesday, KCNA released an article titled News Analysis on Poor Human Rights Records in U.S. It brought up a number of points, including racial discrimination, unemployment, surveillance and poverty. The U.S. is the world's worst human right abuser and tundra of a human being's rights to existence, the essay concludes.

So what is the U.S. actually doing wrong? Here are the key points from the criticism:

Under the citizenship act, racialism is getting more severe in the U.S. The gaps between the minorities and the whites are very wide in the exercise of such rights to work and elect.The U.S. true colors as a kingdom of racial discrimination was fully revealed by last year's case that the Florida Court gave a verdict of not guilty to a white policeman who shot to death an innocent black boy.That's why 52 percent of the Americans have said that racism still exists in the country while 46 percent contended that all sorts of discrimination would be everlasting. The U.S. is a living hell as elementary rights to existence are ruthlessly violated. At present, an average of 300,000 people a week are registered as unemployed, but any proper measure has not been taken. The housing price soared 11.5 percent last year than 2012 and 13.2 percent in January this year than 2013, leaving many people homeless. The number of impoverished people increased to 46.5 millions last year, and one sixth of the citizens and 20-odd percent of the children are in the grip of famine in New York City. All sorts of crimes rampant in the U.S. pose a serious threat to the people's rights to existence and their inviolable rights. The U.S. government has monitored every movement of its citizens and foreigners, with many cameras and tapping devices and even drones involved, under the pretext of 'national security.'Meanwhile, bills on easing arms control were adopted in various states of the country, boosting murderous crimes. As a result, the U.S. has witnessed an increasing number of gun-related crimes in all parts of the country and even its military bases this year. In this regard, the United Nations on April 10 put the U.S. on the top of the world list of homicide rates.The U.S. also has 2.2 millions of prisoners at present, the highest number in the world. For lack of prisons on the part of the government, individuals are providing detention facilities to make money. A Russian TV said that in the U.S. the wealthy classes are now keen on the investment in providing private prisons for their high profit and so more people will be imprisoned. Its chief executive, Obama, indulges himself in luxury almost every day, squandering hundred millions of dollars on his foreign trip in disregard of his people's wretched life.

The United States isn't the only nation on the receiving end of North Korea's criticism. According to Daily NK, state newspaper Rodong Sinmun announced on Wednesday that North Korea has released a white paper criticizing human rights in South Korea. The report argues that the South has the worst human rights situation in the world, and it's deprived of everything thanks to America.

“Over 60% of university students cannot afford their school fees so must work [to make ends meet], the newspaper said, according to a translation from Daily NK. Some even have to subject their bodies to medical trials.

North Korea's criticism refers to many issues that Americans feel strongly about, such as the Trayvon Martin case, NSA surveillance and private prisons. And while it doesn't cite its data, some of the allegations can be fact-checked: According to Bloomberg, a four-week moving average for jobless claims was 316,750 in the period that ended April 19, while KCNA's house price data appears to come from the S&P/Case-Shiller price index, and its data from opinion polls on racism fits into a broad trend can be that found from other polls.

In fact, the only truly debatable part is on gun crime. While it's true that the number of mass shootings has risen in the United States, violent crime in general has dropped over the past few years, with homicide rates down in most major cities. And while the April 10 U.N. report did note that the United States has a high murder rate, the top spot went to Honduras. (KCNA appears to have misread the report, which said the Americas were the region with most gun crime.)

In South Korea, it's true that tuition is an issue: While college fees are relatively low compared to the United States, students have protested in recent years as tuition rates rose and job prospects dimmed.

Perhaps you can argue that the United States is a living hell as elementary rights to existence are ruthlessly violated. But does the reality of the situation in the West really compare to stories from North Korea, where hundreds of thousands of people are thought to have died in gulags, where citizens are watched and discriminated against for their political views, and where escaping to another country is prohibited by the state? In the end, this all serves as a nice reminder: Whataboutism seems to be doing better than ever in the 21st century.","In February, the United Nations released a remarkably comprehensive report on North Korea's human rights abuses.

Iran won limited relief from Western sanctions after agreeing to curtail its nuclear activities for six months under an interim accord with world powers which took effect in January.

A complete lifting of sanctions would require a comprehensive deal to end a decade-long stand-off over what Tehran maintains is a nuclear program for peaceful energy purposes.

Iranian airlines will be ready to buy 40 passenger planes every year for 10 years if sanctions are lifted, said Ali Reza Jahangirian, head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation, the Ettelaat newspaper reported on Thursday.

The 400 figure confirmed the top end of a range reported by Reuters in November citing a senior Iranian official.

Boeing and Airbus, which took orders for more than 2,800 aircraft from airlines and lessors in 2013, would likely lead the battle for Iran's business.

Canada's Bombardier, Embraer from Brazil and Russia's Superjet could also secure orders for the smaller airliners they produce along with engine makers GE Aviation and Rolls-Royce.

Jahangirian said out of Iran's 250 commercial planes, about 150 were flying while the rest are not functional due to a lack of spare parts.

We have got very positive signals from Western companies, including Boeing Co. and General Electric Co. (GE) about getting new spare parts for our planes, he said.

The current, preliminary deal allows for the limited sale of commercial plane parts and services to Iran, whose fleet includes vintage Boeing and Airbus airliners.

GE has won U.S. Treasury approval to service 18 engines sold to Iran in the late 1970s. They will be serviced at facilities owned by GE or Germany's MTU Aero Engines, which is licensed to do the work.

Iran's four largest carriers - Iran Air, Iran Aseman Airlines, Mahan Air and Iran Air Tours - all have average fleet ages above 22 years, Iranian media have reported.

They serve a market of 76 million people in a country whose vast oil and gas reserves could help draw foreign companies once sanctions are lifted.

President Hassan Rouhani was elected last year on a promise to improve Iran's relations with the outside world. He has invited Western companies to seize investment opportunities in the Islamic state.

Tehran has also repeatedly said it was determined to reach a

comprehensive nuclear deal with major powers so it can develop its battered economy.

Iran will resume negotiations with the United States, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia in Vienna on May 13 aimed at a long-term deal.

Thousands have been marching in Washington DC to protest against the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. Launched by Cowboy and Indian Alliance, the six-day event “Reject and Protect” is aimed at urging President Barack Obama to refuse the project.


  A mass crowd of protesters joined Saturday the anti-pipeline
  rally in Washington to say ‘No” the proposed Keystone pipeline -
  a $5.4 billion project that would pump tar sand oil from Alberta,
  Canada through the US to Texas refineries.



  Chanting slogans and carrying placards, demonstrators called on
  the president to “protect our sacred land” and “sacred
  water.” Participants of the event say on twitter that
  “thousands of #NoKXL supporters” took to streets for the
  demonstration.

  The event kicked off on Tuesday with the Cowboy and Indian
  Alliance, a group of ranchers, farmers, and tribal communities
  from along the Keystone pipeline route, riding on horseback
  through the American capital.



  Dressed in traditional clothes – cowboy hats and native
  headdresses – demonstrators marched through downtown DC and set
  up a camp with traditional tepees on the National Mall near the
  White House. The encampment has been the center of the week-long
  protest which included a whole bunch of events such as ‘water
  ceremonies,” “music and sharing stories,” documentary shows,
  flash-mob round dance and other ceremonies. Saturday though was
  planned as the most important day of the week, with several
  thousands of people expected to join the protest.

  damage to the environment, pollute water sources and pose a
  threat to public health.



  “We’re here to show Obama, to show Washington DC the very
  faces of the people that the decision of the KXL pipeline
  represents,” Dallas Goldtooth, one of the activists told a
  crowd on the mall, as cited by ABC. “These people represent
  families, they represent communities, they represent entire

  the Keystone XL pipeline and to all pipelines.”



  “We came to D.C. with a lot of resolve to make sure that the

  political activist who has helped lead the protest movement,

  The project has been mulled over for quite a while now: Canada's
  oil industry applied to build the pipeline several years ago but
  it still needs to get the green light from Washington. The
  planned pipeline has seen strong opposition in the US, with many
  believing the carbon-intensive impact that results from the
  extraction of tar sands will worsen the effects of climate
  change. They also fear the pipeline will put nearby communities
  at risk of oil spills and their subsequent fallout.



  Last week, the White House postponed the decision on the Keystone
  oil pipeline, saying that it would give more time for federal
  agencies to weigh in on the project, and setting no new deadline
  for comments.



  The Calgary-based company that wants to build the pipeline,
  TransCanada Corporation, said it was “extremely disappointed and
  frustrated with yet another delay”.



  “Keystone XL improves American energy security, minimizes the
  environmental and safety impacts of moving that oil to U.S.
  refineries, helps contribute to jobs and American businesses and
  continues to have the support of a strong majority of Americans
  and Congress. It is truly in the national interest of America and
  a majority of Americans in poll after poll after poll continue to
  agree and just want this pipeline built,” Russ Girling,
  TransCanada’s CEO and president said in a statement.

Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping revealed his dream of “a great revival of the Chinese nation” to introduce China to the world as a modern power, rather than a trove of mothballed historical artifacts like the Terracotta Army or the Forbidden City.

“A nation once hidden behind the ‘Bamboo Curtain,’ China has begun to open up to the world quite fast and unexpectedly since the early reform era. The Western perception of its culture is rather chaotic as it tries to grasp the idea of a 5,000-year Chinese colossus in its simplified form,” Luzyanin said.

The new Chinese government under Xi has recognized this problem and devised a step-by-step program to introduce the West to its culture, starting from the outward attributes of China’s ancient history like Confucius to the modern history of Communism and Mao up to its contemporaneous form, with its changing city landscape and vibrant metropolises.

“The next stage would be to teach the West about the deeper layers of Chinese culture. Here Beijing faces a problem akin to that of a primary school teacher who needs to explain to the ‘children’ that the ‘adult world’ of the Chinese civilization is a hundred times older and more complex than all Western civilizations combined, which is far from an easy task,” Luzyanin noted.

According to the expert, the West has been comfortable with a mixed bag of stereotypes about China that comprises elements of popular culture, cinema tropes, Chinese cuisine tips and tourist brochures. The Chinese hope to make use of these scraps and pieces to introduce Americans and Europeans to their culture.

“Projects of the Confucius Institute, huge financial and political resources that are lavished on the promotion of China’s image abroad are used to ‘coach their students’ ahead of the ‘high school.’ The civilization strategy is gaining steam and the results can wait, because the Chinese know that the day will come when the vine shall give its fruit,” Luzyanin said.

On the other hand, the West hasn’t given up on its attempts to alter the Chinese mentality, although to no avail, because Westernization efforts have only scratched the surface of the Chinese society without making them more liberal politically.

“One can safely say that [the effort] is doomed to fail. The US is making the same mistake as the Soviet leaders of the 1950-60s did when they hoped to engage China into the international Communist movement,” the pundit said.

“For the Chinese, ideological doctrines are secondary … meaning that China only appears to have succumbed to Western influence, while it remains traditional and unchanged,” he said. “We can stay assured that China will digest … and eventually assimilate it all.”

Luzyanin pointed to the Chinese political system and the Communist Party, a reflection of its thousand-year-old management tradition, which answers the question of how it has been surviving alongside liberal economic reforms.

The great Chinese philosopher Confucius said in his Analects that “the gentleman aims at harmony, and not at uniformity. The mean man aims at uniformity and not at harmony.” This, the expert said, is characteristic of the Chinese and Western mindsets, with the former working towards the goal of several centers of power and the latter trying to reduce the existing diversity to a common denominator.

“The question is whether Chinese civilization can create new technologies,” Luzyanin said. “The traditional one certainly could, since all advanced technologies of the past – the compass, the paper, the gunpowder and much more – arose in China.”

By the 18th to 19th centuries, Chinese civilization started to lose to the more vibrant American, European and Dutch economic models, possibly due to China’s preoccupation with humanities compared to technological development. In this regard, Xi Jinping’s desire to revive the nation, whose prior greatness reaches far deeper into the world’s past than that of the West, is only logical.

China’s cultural expanse could serve to uphold its economic miracle that left the world open-mouthed back in 1978. Beijing and Moscow have grown closer since then, with China’s western neighbor exporting tons of raw materials the country needs to keep alight the fires in the furnace of its industry.

In May, President Vladimir Putin is expected to come to Beijing where he will meet with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. A number of bilateral agreements are waiting to be signed on the sidelines, including a deal on liquefied natural gas deliveries to China.","MOSCOW, April 30 (RIA Novosti) – China’s economic boom has led to the imminent revival of its consciousness as a centuries-old civilization that is now trying to spread its cultural influence across the world, says Sergei Luzyanin, Professor of Oriental Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations.

“The question is whether Chinese civilization can create new technologies,” Luzyanin said. “The traditional one certainly could, since all advanced technologies of the past – the compass, the paper, the gunpowder and much more – arose in China.”

By the 18th to 19th centuries, Chinese civilization started to lose to the more vibrant American, European and Dutch economic models, possibly due to China’s preoccupation with humanities compared to technological development. In this regard, Xi Jinping’s desire to revive the nation, whose prior greatness reaches far deeper into the world’s past than that of the West, is only logical.

China’s cultural expanse could serve to uphold its economic miracle that left the world open-mouthed back in 1978. Beijing and Moscow have grown closer since then, with China’s western neighbor exporting tons of raw materials the country needs to keep alight the fires in the furnace of its industry.

In May, President Vladimir Putin is expected to come to Beijing where he will meet with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. A number of bilateral agreements are waiting to be signed on the sidelines, including a deal on liquefied natural gas deliveries to China.",887

NATO must return to its original goal of fending off Russia, seizing the chance presented by the Ukrainian crisis to sever Europe from Moscow and move it closer to America, the US secretary of state said. Or else the bloc’s global leadership may be lost.


  John Kerry delivered the confrontational call in a speech to the
  Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, DC. He said the
  stand-off in Ukraine had resulted from a “uniquely
  personally-driven set of choices” and is “a wake-up
  call” for NATO. He added that now the military bloc must
  turn the page on two decades of focusing on expeditionary
  operations and take a stand against “Putin’s Russia.”

“After two decades of focusing primarily on our expeditionary
  missions, the crisis in Ukraine now call us back to the work that
  this alliance was originally created to perform,” Kerry told
  the audience.



  NATO’s original purpose was to oppose the Communist Soviet Union,
  giving the West the military backbone to the ideologically-driven
  stand-off with the East. Kerry described it as “to defend
  alliance territory and advance trans-Atlantic security.”

“Today, Putin’s Russia is playing by a different set of
  rules,” the secretary stated. “Through its occupation of
  Crimea and its subsequent destabilization of eastern Ukraine,
  Russia seeks to change the security landscape of Eastern and
  Central Europe.”

“Together we have to push back against those who try to
  change sovereign border by force. Together we have to support
  those who simply want to live as we do,” he added.



  Kerry didn’t mention NATO’s own operations against Yugoslavia,
  which helped change sovereign borders in Europe. But he said NATO
  must not allow the situation continue to develop as it is,
  because Russia is challenging the position NATO members held
  since the end of the Cold War.


“Our entire model of global leadership is at stake. If we
  stand together, if we draw strength from the example of the past
  and refuse to be complacent in the present, then I am confident
  that NATO, the planet’s strongest alliance, can meet the
  challenges, can absolutely take advantage of the opportunities
  that are presented by crisis,” he stressed.



  Kerry suggested three points on how trans-Atlantic partners can
  preserve their leadership and contain Russia. He said all NATO
  members must comply with alliance’s benchmark of 2 percent GDP
  defense spending, which is not observed by many European members
  of the alliance, including European economic powerhouse Germany.


“Clearly, not all allies are going to meet the NATO benchmark
  of 2 percent of GDP overnight or even next year,” Kerry
  said. “But it’s time for allies, who are below that level to
  make credible commitments to increase their spending on defense
  over the next five years.”


  NATO members must also help Europe reduce its dependence on
  Russian energy and develop economic ties with America by speeding
  down the pipeline the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment
  Partnership Agreement, Kerry said.



  The agreement would certainly give more access to European
  markets to some US corporations, as it would require freeing up
  European regulations on things like fracking, GMOs, copyright and
  finance.



  Kerry’s policy remarks are in line with those made recently by
  some other members of the US political establishment. For example
  Senator John McCain, one of the most vocal critics of Russia,
  went on the same lines of presenting Russia’s stance on Ukraine a
  personal choice by President Vladimir Putin and calling for more
  defense spending in Europe in his speech at Vilnius University,
  Lithuania, on Wednesday last week.


“Considering what President Putin is doing right now in
  Ukraine, it is more important than ever for every NATO ally to
  spend at least 2 percent of its GDP on defense,” McCain
  said. “I'm pleased that Lithuania has pledged and is planning
  to do this, and the sooner you follow through on that commitment
  the better.”


  The US and Russia have been trading accusations of meddling with
  Ukrainian crisis lately. Washington says Moscow is sowing dissent
  in eastern Ukraine, fanning up anti-government protests there.
  Russia says the US sponsored the February coup in Kiev, which
  brought into power the current Ukrainian central authorities and
  has been playing a dominant role in defining the policies of the
  new government.","Trans-Atlantic global leadership at stake in Ukraine – Kerry

Republican members of the United States Senate took further steps on Wednesday towards increasing sanctions against Russia amidst an escalating international crisis surrounding neighboring Ukraine.


  Just two days after US President Barack Obama introduced the
  White House’s latest attempt to reprimand Moscow for its role in
  the Ukrainian ordeal, 19 senators introduced legislation on
  Wednesday described by Reuters as being broader and tougher than
  anything put in place yet by the administration.



  According to Reuters, the sanctions would apply to major
  Russian banks and energy companies, and come with $100 in
  military aid for Kiev. Wall Street Journal reporter Kristine
  Peterson added Wednesday morning that the military
  aspect of the proposal, if approved, would require the White
  House to substantially increase US and NATO support for the armed
  forces of allied Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, as well
  as accelerate implementation of missile defense in Europe.



  On Monday this week, the White House imposed additional sanctions
  on Russia. Those sanctions targeted seven Russian government
  officials and 17 companies closely tied with Russia’s Pres.
  Vladimir Putin.


“Since April 17, Russia has done nothing to meet its Geneva
  commitments and in fact has further escalated the crisis,”
  White House press secretary Jay Carney 
  said on Monday this week. “Russia’s involvement in the
  recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable.”

“The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally; the goal
  is to change his calculus, to encourage him to walk the walk, not
  just talk the talk,” Obama said.


“I think what is happening now shows us who really was
  mastering the process from the beginning,” Pres. Putin
  said
  in response this week. “But in the beginning, the United
  States preferred to remain in the shadow.”


  The Kremlin fired back at first, and said Russia would not be
  hurt by the sanctions. Now just days later, conservative members
  of Congress are saying it’s time for Uncle Sam to up the ante.


“What we’ve seen from the administration is a lot of
  rhetoric,” Sen.Bob Corker(R-Tennessee) said Wednesday
  morning, according to the Journal.


Until Putin feels the real pain of sanctions targeting
  entities like Gazprom, which the Kremlin uses to coerce Ukraine
  and
  other neighbors, as well as some significant financial
  institutions, I don't think diplomacy will change Russian
  behavior and de-escalate this crisis, he said in a
  statement.



  Sen. Dan Coats (R-Indiana) added in his own remarks that “The
  lack of a forceful, effective response by the administration and
  Western leaders has given Putin little reason to expect that
  further aggression will be punished.

“We are introducing tough diplomatic, economic and financial
  sanctions, and I am hopeful that President Obama will support our
  effort,” Coats said.

Political and economic power is draining away from the US, while other states make bilateral agreements like the investment deal between Bahrain and Russia, which makes the US extremely worried, Professor of Binary Economics Rodney Shakespeare told RT.


  The US has sent a message of discontent to its ally Bahrain,
  which signed an investment deal with Russia. Washington has said
  that it is concerned with the Gulf state cozying up to Russia,
  which is currently under sanctions due to the Ukrainian crisis.


RT:Washington and Bahrain have long been
  close on political and economic terms. Why would the Gulf state
  cross its Western ally in the first place?

Rodney Shakespeare: Because economic power is
  going away from the West and it is going away from the US.
  Political power is moving away and the US has lost the vestiges,
  if it ever had it at all, of moral authority. So you have a
  situation at the moment where the US is still in the Cold War
  mindset, and thinking it has got political, economic power, moral
  authority... It thinks that it can tell Russia what to do, but
  the times are changing. And is hubristically thinking that it
  could sanction Russia, particularly when everybody knows that
  it’s really about NATO wanting to put missiles into Ukraine and
  that’s what really is going on; the US is making a big mistake.
  All it is going to do is to increase the desire of others to make
  agreements.



  Bahrain is the most insalubrious and vicious regime, but even
  Bahrain can see that American power is waning. Of course, Russia
  would take this opportunity very reasonably to link up with
  Bahrain and effectively give a ‘V’ sign to the
  Americans. This event between two investment institutions in
  Russia and Bahrain is highly significant; it is something that
  shows you that Western and American power is declining, others
  are making new agreements. And frankly, the Americans are going
  to lose in this situation and eventually the dollar will collapse
  as these agreements increase.


RT:All this comes just a day after
  President Putin said Russia could reconsider Western investment
  in its energy sector. This threat now looks more serious, doesn't
  it?

RS: Russia has huge natural resources, it’s a
  vast country, and has a highly advanced population. The bottom
  line in all this: it’s not Standard & Poor’s saying they are
  going to downgrade bonds for Russia. The physical realities are
  that Russia will survive and will be making more agreements and
  behind all this is the ultimate weakness of the dollar. It really
  doesn’t matter what happens now but the thing goes on and will
  end up more and more to the advantage of Russia and other
  countries, which refuse to be bullied by the US.


RT:While it's worth 10 billion dollars,
  that's not exactly a record breaker when it comes to investment.
  So why is Washington getting so worried about it?

RS: This is symbolic. Bahrain is in the Persian
  Gulf and it is where the American fleet by which America supports
  Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates. Those countries, of course,
  ultimately support the expansion of Zionist Israel which is what
  it is about. But as soon as Bahrain, the center of naval power of
  the US, makes an agreement with Russia, America is panicking,
  they are realizing that this is a sign of the times and after all
  the bluster of the Americans, people are just going to go and
  make their own way, and the more Americans try to sanction, the
  more they are going to make agreements like this. So America is
  panicking because they recognize that their power is on the wane
  and this symbolizes that waning power.


RT:With the West constantly stepping up the
  sanctions rhetoric and new players now apparently emerging in the
  game, could we see a re-drawing of the geo-political map
  here?

RS: Yes. American power still amounts to some
  military power, its spying power and others haven’t quite
  organized themselves. The BRIC countries, for example, haven’t
  quite established a new internet repayment system and they
  haven’t quite established their equivalent to the IMF. To some
  extent the whole situation is premature, and then of course other
  countries have to find agreements among themselves, not economic,
  but political. In a very fundamental way, the bullying of the
  West is going to come to an end at some stage; that is going to
  be a very dangerous period because the Americans have got
  military power. But you are starting to see re-alignments… they
  have been going on for quite a time, and the effects of
  sanctioning Russia means that they are not going to have it, they
  are going to go off and make agreements. I tell you, we want
  sanctions on Israel and at one stage we are going to have
  sanctions on the US because that’s what is going to happen if
  America continues as it is, because everybody has got fed up with
  them.

  vast country, and has a highly advanced population. The bottom
  line in all this: it’s not Standard & Poor’s saying they are
  going to downgrade bonds for Russia. The physical realities are
  that Russia will survive and will be making more agreements and
  behind all this is the ultimate weakness of the dollar. It really
  doesn’t matter what happens now but the thing goes on and will
  end up more and more to the advantage of Russia and other
  countries, which refuse to be bullied by the US.


RT:While it's worth 10 billion dollars,
  that's not exactly a record breaker when it comes to investment.
  So why is Washington getting so worried about it?

RS: This is symbolic. Bahrain is in the Persian
  Gulf and it is where the American fleet by which America supports
  Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates. Those countries, of course,
  ultimately support the expansion of Zionist Israel which is what
  it is about. But as soon as Bahrain, the center of naval power of
  the US, makes an agreement with Russia, America is panicking,
  they are realizing that this is a sign of the times and after all
  the bluster of the Americans, people are just going to go and
  make their own way, and the more Americans try to sanction, the
  more they are going to make agreements like this. So America is
  panicking because they recognize that their power is on the wane
  and this symbolizes that waning power.


RT:With the West constantly stepping up the
  sanctions rhetoric and new players now apparently emerging in the
  game, could we see a re-drawing of the geo-political map
  here?

RS: Yes. American power still amounts to some
  military power, its spying power and others haven’t quite
  organized themselves. The BRIC countries, for example, haven’t
  quite established a new internet repayment system and they
  haven’t quite established their equivalent to the IMF. To some
  extent the whole situation is premature, and then of course other
  countries have to find agreements among themselves, not economic,
  but political. In a very fundamental way, the bullying of the
  West is going to come to an end at some stage; that is going to
  be a very dangerous period because the Americans have got
  military power. But you are starting to see re-alignments… they
  have been going on for quite a time, and the effects of
  sanctioning Russia means that they are not going to have it, they
  are going to go off and make agreements. I tell you, we want
  sanctions on Israel and at one stage we are going to have
  sanctions on the US because that’s what is going to happen if
  America continues as it is, because everybody has got fed up with
  them.

“New sanctions by the EU and the US are the way leading in the opposite direction. We have seen this before.

“The agreement must be implemented by Ukraine, a country where all these events are taking place. But all sanctions are directed against Russia, which is not clear at all,” he added.

People in eastern Ukraine are not pro-Russian, they want a united and federalized Ukraine, a Finlandized Ukraine that is equally distant from the EU, NATO and Russia, and they are being confronted by guns, investigative journalist Pepe Escobar told RT.

RT:We're now seeing Kiev deploying the
  military against its own people. Do you think the situation
  requires that?

Pepe Escobar: No, of course not. Flashback, it’s
  very important. A few days ago John Brennan, head of the CIA,
  goes to Kiev, they launch an anti-terrorist operation. It’s a
  huge failure. A few days later US Vice-President Joe Biden goes
  to Kiev, they launch a second anti-terrorist operation and it’s a
  huge failure. So this is a third actually, but it is really
  serious because they’re choking Slavyansk, and in fact that is a
  key city where protests are really advanced. It is like the
  People’s republic of Donetsk, there is also the People’s republic
  of Slavyansk at the moment. It’s a huge provocation and in fact
  this is concomitant to NATO ratcheting up the pressure, saying
  that “We won’t go to support Russian aggression.” Russia
  is waiting to see what is going to happen and the Kremlin has
  already been very explicit: “If civilian Ukrainians are
  killed by the Ukrainian army which is a mix of army and Right
  Sector militia in fact, then the things are going to be spiraling
  out of control.” And obviously Russia doesn’t want that, but
  this is what NATO wants and what the Kiev government wants.


RT:We spoke to one of the Self-Defense
  Commanders in Slavyansk. He said it was not just the military,
  but also Right Sector members moving against Slavyansk. How
  involved do you think radicals are likely to be?

PE: Completely involved because now they are an
  actual militia. This reminds me a lot of Somalia, Afghanistan,
  Iraq and Syria for that matter. Now we are having Ukrainian
  neo-Nazi, neo-fascist militias fighting for a bunch of regime
  changers in Kiev and using what is left of the Ukrainian army
  which is in a pitiful state to attack and encircle a city. Sooner
  or later they will be attacking civilians. This is completely
  crazy. Where is the UN in all this? Nowhere to be seen! Nobody is
  doing anything, and Putin and Merkel talked yesterday and Putin
  told Merkel explicitly: “Look, if they don’t retreat troops
  back to Kiev and if they start attacking civilians, then it is a
  completely different ball game”. Nobody wants this as I said
  before. NATO needs a reason because the propaganda for the past
  three weeks has been relentless: Demonization of Russia,
  demonization of Vladimir Putin and demonization of the
  pro-Russian militants in the eastern Ukraine. They are not
  pro-Russian, they want a united Ukraine, a federalized Ukraine, a
  Finlandized Ukraine that is not allied with the EU and NATO or
  with Russia, it’s equidistant. And they want more autonomy in the
  eastern and southern provinces. This is what those
  “militants” want in fact. And now they are being
  confronted by guns.

  there are casualties already. How much uglier can we expect this
  to get?

  spark is enough to light a prairie fire.” This could be the
  spark that lights the prairie fire of the civil war in Ukraine
  where we are going to have face to face, in the worst possible

The Republic of the Congo, a resource-rich state in central Africa, plans to attract infrastructure investment from Russia, President Denis Sassou Nguesso told Russian media.

“We plan to develop co-operation in all areas: hydrocarbons,
  agriculture, minerals, logging and education and training,”
  he said to RIA Novosti.



  Sassou Nguesso, who first became the leader of his country in
  1979, was originally a committed Marxist, and relied on the
  Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991.



  He still thanks the USSR “for fighting for the freedom of the
  people of Africa,” and speaks warmly of the thousands of
  Congolese who studied and married in the Soviet Union. However,
  he realizes that the relationship had to be rebuilt anew,
  following wide-scale political and economic transformations in
  both countries.



  Sassou Nguesso believes the foundation was laid during an
  official meeting with Vladimir Putin in November 2012.


“These extraordinarily important talks allowed us to
  re-launch our partnership,” he said. “A new stage has
  started and in the coming month an inter-governmental
  Russia-Republic of the Congo commission will meet. As a result of
  these sessions we hope to establish new concrete aims and
  projects.”


  The veteran politician, who won his fifth presidential term in
  2009 and will be in office until at least 2016, is encouraged at
  the idea of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa)
  providing an alternative source of support for the continent’s
  growth, apart from the IMF and the World Bank.

  development bank that will offer funding for African states.

  “colonialists” and believes that only through closer
  integration with each other will African powers be able to
  project a voice onto the world stage.


“All countries are trying to join large blocs, and Africa,
  which was divided by outside forces, cannot ignore this
  process.”


  But for the moment, his focus remains on bringing prosperity to
  his own country, with a population of 4 million. It endured a
  devastating civil war in the late 1990s, and is nestled next to
  the troubled West African Republic.

On Tuesday, Rogozin lashed out again, this time at newly announced U.S. ban on high-tech exports to Russia.

The U.S. introduced sanctions against our space industry. God knows, we warned them: we respond to declarations w/ declarations, to actions w/ actions, Rogozin tweeted, later adding: After analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest the U.S. delivers its astronauts to the ISS [international space station] with a trampoline.

Rogozin does actually have a point, although his threats carry much less weight than he may hope.

It's true that Russian shuttles are currently the only option for getting U.S. citizens to get to the space station, and the United States pays Russia some $71 million per person they get up there. In fact, Russia is due to get a $457.9 million payment for its services soon. If it really wanted to, Russia could stop U.S. astronauts from reaching the station, despite the fact that the United States funded as much as $100 billion of the space station's $160 billion price tag. Worse still, it could refuse to let the two U.S. citizens currently on the space station return home.

Thankfully, that seems a remote possibility – $457.9 million a lot of money for Russia's aerospace industry, and few believe that Russia would actually give it up. Plus, as Jeffrey Kluger noted at Time Magazine last month, Russia may not want to push the United States into the hands of SpaceX and Orbital Sciences, two private American companies that hope to be able to send passengers to the station soon. So, while things may be a little awkward for a while, don't expect a change to the status quo.

Rogozin's comments on Tuesday are just his latest criticism of U.S. sanctions. At the beginning of April, he mocked Western attempts to targeted his foreign assets, tweeting, Have you found my accounts, money transfers, real estate, luxury cars, yachts, etc?

His criticism is legitimate – asset seizures only work if there are foreign assets to seize (or if those can be found), and, as The Post's Michael Birnbaum recently reported, there are few signs of sanctions on the street in Russia. However, when Rogozin asked those who sanctioned him to send me your teeth ground in impotent rage, he may have gone a bit far.","Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin has become one of the most vocal critics of the United States in the past few months, often using his English-language Twitter account to fire off insults against the economic policies which he himself is personally targeted by.

Rogozin does actually have a point, although his threats carry much less weight than he may hope.

It's true that Russian shuttles are currently the only option for getting U.S. citizens to get to the space station, and the United States pays Russia some $71 million per person they get up there. In fact, Russia is due to get a $457.9 million payment for its services soon. If it really wanted to, Russia could stop U.S. astronauts from reaching the station, despite the fact that the United States funded as much as $100 billion of the space station's $160 billion price tag. Worse still, it could refuse to let the two U.S. citizens currently on the space station return home.

Thankfully, that seems a remote possibility – $457.9 million a lot of money for Russia's aerospace industry, and few believe that Russia would actually give it up. Plus, as Jeffrey Kluger noted at Time Magazine last month, Russia may not want to push the United States into the hands of SpaceX and Orbital Sciences, two private American companies that hope to be able to send passengers to the station soon. So, while things may be a little awkward for a while, don't expect a change to the status quo.

Rogozin's comments on Tuesday are just his latest criticism of U.S. sanctions. At the beginning of April, he mocked Western attempts to targeted his foreign assets, tweeting, Have you found my accounts, money transfers, real estate, luxury cars, yachts, etc?

His criticism is legitimate – asset seizures only work if there are foreign assets to seize (or if those can be found), and, as The Post's Michael Birnbaum recently reported, there are few signs of sanctions on the street in Russia. However, when Rogozin asked those who sanctioned him to send me your teeth ground in impotent rage, he may have gone a bit far.",503

The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov, Gennady Kernes, has been shot in the back, the city council’s press service reports. He is currently in serious condition in one of the city’s hospitals.


  Kernes was shot while cycling on a road in the north of the city,
  Yury Sidorenko, of the mayor’s press service, told RT.


“They shot him in the back from the forest,” Kernes’s
  friend Yury Sapronov said. “The injury is serious. His lung
  is pierced and his liver pierced all the way through.”


  The mayor was taken to the local hospital at about 11:30 am (8:30
  GMT) local time.



  Following an operation that lasted two hours, Valery Boyko, the
  surgeon who was treating Kernes, called his condition serious as
  his diaphragm had been injured. He also said that his interior
  organs have been damaged and he will remain in serious condition
  for at least several days.



  Boyko said that the doctors had stopped the bleeding, but that
  Kernes is currently unconscious.


“The operation was performed successfully. Now we rely on God
  and wish strength to Gennady Kernes,” he added.



  Meanwhile, Sidorenko, of mayor’s press service, declined to
  comment about who was behind the shooting. He only told RT that
  Kernes “has been recently receiving a lot of threats from
  various people.”


  A shell “allegedly from sniper rifle” was found at the
  site where the mayor was shot, Irina Kushchenko, from the public
  relations department of the city’s Executive Committee.



  Party of Regions presidential candidate Mikhail Dobkin, a close
  friend of Kernes, said the gunman used live fire. According to
  Dobkin, there was a 7.62 mm shell from a Dragunov sniper rifle.



  An unexploded grenade has also been found at the scene where the
  mayor was shot, Mikhail Dobkin has told local media.
  

“At the spot where he fell, a grenade without a pin was
  found,” he said, as cited by ITAR-TASS news agency. “By
  a lucky chance, it did not explode.”


  A mayor of Kharkov since March 2010, Kernes had been a strong
  supporter of President Viktor Yanukovich right till his ouster in
  February. Since then he supported the new Ukrainian authorities
  and kept his position.



  The shooting comes a day after ultranationalists clashed with
  anti-government protesters in the city, leaving 14 people
  injured.



  Meanwhile, Ukrainian presidential candidate Oleg Tsarev condemned
  the attack on the Kharkov mayor. He said that despite his and
  Kernes’ political rivalry, the attack outraged him.


“Shooting at the politicians is wrong. Once again it shows
  that it is impossible to hold presidential elections until we
  reach consensus and civil peace,” he added.



  Kharkov mayor and Party of Regions member Gennady Kernes was born
  June 27, 1959, in Kharkov, then in the Ukrainian SSR. He is a
  lawyer and manager by profession.



  A miner in the late 70s, Kernes became engaged in politics in
  1998, when he ran for the Kharkov City Council.



  In 2004, Kernes was an enthusiastic supporter of the Orange
  Revolution. Political alliances secured him the mayor’s post on
  October 31, 2010, after Mikhail Dobkin had become head of the
  regional state administration. The results, which were
  overwhelmingly in his favor again, were controversial and came
  under suspicion from critics. During his tenure as mayor, he has
  become well known among locals for his far-reaching city reforms
  and his contributions to development and charitable causes.



  However, Kernes’s past is also entangled with Ukraine’s
  underworld – among other things, he was allegedly the boss of his
  own criminal organization, which gained notoriety in the region.
  He was also convicted of theft and fraud.



  Since the February 2014 coup in Ukraine, he has been accused of
  fomenting separatism. In January, he gave himself a controversial
  25 percent pay rise.



  Kernes was awarded many political honors in his time. He is a
  father of three children. His hobbies, among other things,
  include actively promoting and leading a healthy lifestyle.



  Thousands of anti-government demonstrations have swept eastern
  Ukraine since March, with administration buildings being seized
  in several cities, including Kharkov, the largest city.



  At the beginning of March some 111 people were injured in clashes
  between anti-government protesters and radical nationalists in
  the city after the radical groups then seized the administration
  building. Commenting on the incident, Mayor Kernes said they were
  ultra nationalist elements “who hid their faces behind masks
  and had weapons, including automatic ones,” adding that
  “it turned out that these men came from western Ukraine –
  from Lvov, Ivano-Frankovsk.”","Mayor of Kharkov, Ukraine shot in back, hospitalized - press service

The chancellor of Germany spoke alongside United States President Barack Obama on Friday about the National Security Agency's surveillance practices for the first time in the US since she voiced concerns last year about leaked NSA operations.


  A joint news conference Friday afternoon at the White House Rose
  Garden in downtown Washington, DC between the two primarily
  concerned the escalating situation in Ukraine, but both Pres.
  Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel also discussed the NSA in the
  wake of disclosures that last year propelled the secretive
  American spy agency into the international spotlight.



  Although Merkel has adamantly spoken out against the NSA's
  surveillance practices in the months since those disclosures
  first surfaced last June, Friday's meeting at the president's
  home marked her first visit to the White House since.



  After both Obama and Merkel made prepared remarks at the Rose
  Garden about the Ukrainian crisis, the American president took a
  moment to put aside queries from the press and instead bring it
  upon himself to address the tensions between America and Germany
  that have worsened as a result of the NSA leaks.



  In the months since former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden
  disclosed those previously secret documents to the media, the
  NSA's practices have attracted criticism from all corners of the
  globe. On her part, however, Merkel made considerable waves after
  raising questions about the NSA's alleged spying on foreign
  leaders, including herself. Before long, the US intelligence
  community was linked to conducting surveillance on numerous
  officials atop the governments of allied nations, and other
  countries quickly condemned America's behavior as well.


“Germany is one of our closest allies and our closest
  friends, and that is true across the spectrum of issue —
  security, intelligence, economic, diplomatic — and Angela Merkel
  is one of my closest friends on the world stage and somebody
  whose partnership I deeply value,” Obama said. “And so
  it has pained me to see that degree to which the Snowden
  disclosures have created strains in the relationship,” the
  president added.



  Last October, a spokesperson for Merkel said she told the
  president that being targeted by US surveillance was
  “completely unacceptable” and represented a “grave
  breach of trust.”

“Under the present conditions,” Merkel said Friday,
  Germany and the US have “differences of opinions to
  overcome.”


  To do as much, Merkel said, both parties should enter in a “cyber
  dialogue” or sorts in order to have a forum for a longer
  discussion on the matter. Snowden's revelations have provoked the
  US to already consider some reforms both internationally and
  domestically, but Merkel said allied partners of the US should
  have a say as well.



  “I've also been convinced for a very long time that it is
  important for our legal structures and our policy structures to
  catch up with rapidly advancing technologies,” Obama said
  later, “and as a consequences, through a series of steps,
  what we tried to do is reform what we do and have taken these
  issues very seriously.”


  The president further celebrated his administration's attempts
  during the last few months to reign in the NSA to a degree,
  assuring Chancellor Merkel in particular that he's been pursuing
  changes she'd likely approve of.


“Domestically, we tried to provide additional assurances to
  the American people that their privacy is protected. But what
  I've also done is taken the unprecedented step of ordering our
  intelligence community to take the privacy interests of non US
  persons into account in everything that they do — something that
  has not been done before and something that most other countries
  in the world do not do.”


  Merkel, however, did not immediately accept the president's
  assurances as other allies have in the past after being with
  apologies from the Obama administration. While the German
  chancellor acknowledged on Friday that she still has her concerns
  surrounding the NSA, for instance, French President Fran?ois
  Hollande said after his meeting with Obama in February that
  “Mutual trust has been restored.”


  Meanwhile, Pres. Obama also said during the presser that the
  NSA's actual abilities have been inflated.


“I know that the perception among the public sometimes is
  that the US has capacities similar to what you see in movies and
  on television,” he added. “The truth of the matter is
  that our focus is principally and primarily on how do we make
  sure that terrorists, those who want to proliferate weapons,
  transnational criminals, are not able to engage in the activities
  that they engage in.”


  Obama went on to say that while the US won't succeed in reaching
  these goals on its own, his administration is committed to a
  US-German cyber dialogue as proposed by the chancellor in order
  “to close further the gaps that may exist in terms of how we
  operate, how German intelligence operates, to make sure there is
  transparency and clarity and what we are doing and what our goals
  and intentions are.”

“These are complicated issues and we are not perfectly
  aligned yet, but we share the same values and we share the same
  concerns, and this is something that is deeply important to
  me,” he said.","Germany not satisfied with US assurances over NSA spying

“To make claims to us that we have allegedly signed in Geneva something that delegitimises actions of current authorities is a lie,” the minister noted.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov plans to speak by telephone with US Secretary of State John Kerry later this Friday to discuss the situation in Ukraine.

Addressing a forum of young diplomats on Friday, the minister said he also planned to discuss with his US counterpart the fate of Pavel Guberev, elected in Donetsk as people's governor and currently held in custody.

The Foreign Ministry said earlier that telephone contacts between Lavrov and Kerry planned for April 23 and 24 did not take place, for reasons beyond Moscow's control.

Earlier, US Secretary of State John Kerry’s statement that Ukrainian law enforcers had allegedly seized several Russian security agents was not serious talk,  Sergei Lavrov said.
“Kerry has said many times that Ukrainian security services had captured several Russian security agents. So, show them to people, show them on television,” Lavrov added.

 

Puntitive action and a crime in Ukraine

“The so-called Easter ceasefire was disrupted,” the foreign minister said, noting that “What Kiev authorities are doing today is just a punitive operation which already resulted in many victims. These are bloody crimes for which they will be held responsible.

The West wants to take control of Ukraine being guided only by their geo-political ambitions, he added.

“It is high time for Western partners to admit the truth that they do not have a monopoly for truth,” the minister noted, adding that “And this is unacceptable to make a certain picture of current events as the West want it to be. The West wants to take control of Ukraine guided only by their geo-political ambitions.”

“Today it is impossible to conceal the truth. And attempts to do so lead to nothing good,” Lavrov said.

If current Kiev authorities really begin to fulfil the Geneva accord, take away Maidan protesters and disarm Ukrainian ultranationalists from Right Sector their opponents in south-eastern Ukraine will take reciprocal steps, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov believes

“Stop to violence should be a first step,” the minister noted.

He noted that this meant an immediate stop to army’s actions against their own people.

 

To defuse the tense

Those who are currently in power in Kiev are to blame for the escalation, he noted.

Maidan remains in Kiev, and nobody intends to leave it, he said.

Instead of car tyres, concrete blocks are placed there now, and nobody intends to disperse, the minister said. Instead of disarming the Right Sector and other radicals, Americans rebuke us.

If we want to talk about actions, it should be remembered who started the escalation, Lavrov added. Escalation was started by the current authorities in Kiev, who carried out the coup d’tat.

Russia will not use ultimatums in seeking to achieve goals from events in Ukraine, Lavrov said. “Certainly, we do not have such a heavy-handed discipline which exists in NATO and the European Union, though there are some opinions there that are different from the common position,” the minister said, adding that “We prefer not to act through ultimatums within the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)...We are decent people, after all.

“When a resolution on Ukraine was moved in the UN General Assembly, Americans and Western Europeans, primarily Americans, sent their emissaries throughout the world. There was not a single country where they had not knocked at with a demand to support compulsorily this Ukrainian resolution. In fact, this is not a resolution on Ukraine, but an anti-Russian one,” Lavrov said.

Crimea's example

When asked about it, the minister said he had not heard there was such intention.

Abkhazia and South Ossetia are our partners, and we will respect the way they have chosen, he said.

Carney said the sanctions were in response to Crimea’s reunification with Russia, which the United States does not acknowledge, as well as Russia’s stance on Ukraine.

“At the contact group meeting in Geneva on April 17, 2014, Russia, Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union decided on a number of steps to deescalate the situation in eastern Ukraine, including refraining from further violence or provocative acts. Since April 17, Russia has done nothing to meet its Geneva commitments and in fact has further escalated the crisis. Russia’s involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable,” Carney said.

The United States has imposed sanctions on individuals in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

“The Department of the Treasury is imposing sanctions on seven Russian government officials, including two members of President Putin’s inner circle, who will be subject to an asset freeze and a US visa ban, and 17 companies linked to Putin’s inner circle, which will be subject to an asset freeze. In addition, the Department of Commerce has imposed additional restrictions on 13 of those companies by imposing a license requirement with a presumption of denial for the export, re-export or other foreign transfer of US-origin items to the companies. Further, today the Departments of Commerce and State have announced a tightened policy to deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russia’s military capabilities,” Carney said.

The individuals included in the sanctions are: Russian Presidential Envoy to Crimea Oleg Belaventsev, Rostech CEO Sergei Chemezov, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, Director of the Federal Protective Service of the Russian Federation Yevgeny Murov, Chairman of State Duma Committee on International Affairs Alexei Pushkov, Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, and First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Vyacheslav Volodin.

All of the 17 companies named by the US Treasury are either controlled or linked to individuals and companies mentioned in the previous list of sanctions.

The list includes Volga Group, an investment vehicle that manages assets on behalf of sanctions-hit businessman Gennady Timchenko. The other sanctions-hit companies designated for being owned or controlled by Timchenko or the Volga Group are soft drink producer Aquanika Holding Limited, business aviation companies Avia Group and Avia Group Nord, transportation company Sakhatrans LLC and oil and gas rail freight operator Transoil.

Other companies sanctioned for being owned or controlled by Timchenko are holding company for construction assets Stroytransgaz Holding, construction group Stroytransgaz Group, infrastructure construction company Stroytransgaz LLC, electricity construction company Stroytransgaz OJSC and industrial construction company Stroytransgaz-M.

The list also names banks Investcapitalbank and SMP Bank, as well as gas pipeline construction company Stroygazmontazh, owned or controlled by Boris Rotenberg and/or his older brother Arkady, who were sanctioned last month.

Three organizations owned or controlled by Bank Rossiya - group of leasing companies Zest, Investment Company LLC Abros and bank Sobinbank – were also hit by the new round of sanctions.

Speaking in the Philippines ahead of the announcement, President Barack Obama said the goal of the sanctions was “not to go after [Russian President Vladimir] Putin personally,” but “to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he’s engaging in could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.”

Moscow has repeatedly warned that talking in the language of sanctions is “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warned its Western partners about the “boomerang effect” that sanctions would have.

The US and EU earlier imposed targeted sanctions against Moscow over its reunification with Crimea, a former region of Ukraine that held a referendum in March in which 96 percent of population voted for integration with Russia.

The assets of several Russian politicians, lawmakers and businessmen, were frozen; they were also banned from receiving to visas. The G7 countries also threatened Russia with broad economic sanctions in case of further escalation of the situation in Ukraine.

US President Barack Obama said Sunday at a press conference in Malaysia that sanctions against certain sectors of the Russian economy will be effective only if the US and the EU act together.

Kerry, landing in the South Sudan capital of Juba on Friday, conveyed the threat of US sanctions against prominent South Sudanese leaders if the violence did not stop.

He also sought to compel authorities on both sides of the fight to put aside personal and tribal animosities for the good of a nation that declared independence three years ago to escape decades of war.

Obama, as he often does at home as consoler-in-chief, will offer support to survivors and victims' families as he pauses from the policy and diplomatic demands of his week-long trip to Asia.

Last week, Obama called the disaster heartbreaking, a gesture that was noted and well received within the government in Seoul.

The capsizing of the ferry Sewol carrying almost 500 people, including high school students on a field trip, has occupied most of South Korean President Park Guen-hye's time over the past week.

Park has confronted outcry from South Koreans who want answers on why the ferry turned over. A criminal investigation is underway.

The ferry disaster will no doubt overshadow some part the original intent of Obama's visit — to reinforce ties with a strong U.S. ally in the increasingly important Asia-Pacific region.

United front against North Korea

Both countries want to display a united front against North Korea, which in recent days has stepped up activity at its main nuclear test site — possibly in preparation for another underground blast.

The North Korean Foreign Ministry this week described Obama's trip to Seoul as a reactionary and dangerous one as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region.

Obama, speaking Thursday, called on North Korea to start changing your behavior.

They are the most isolated country in the world. They are subject to more international sanctions and international condemnation than any country in the world. As a consequence, their people suffer as much as any peoples in the world, he said.

Aims to reassure Pacific allies

Obama headed to Seoul from Tokyo, where a formal state visit — complete with a royal audience and a black-tie dinner — was meant to exhibit strong ties between Japan and the United States.

White House officials hope the week-long trip to Asia will reassure Pacific allies the U.S. remains committed to turning its foreign policy focus to them. But he has few tangible deliverables to take home.

In Tokyo at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama was pressed on whether he would use military force to defend an obscure set of islands controlled by Japan that are at the heart of a heated regional dispute with China.

He said the U.S. security pact with Japan does extend to the islands -- known as Diaoyu to the Chinese -- and insisted his implicit offer to defend them against any Chinese incursion did not amount to drawing a red line around the contested land.

The treaty between the U.S. and Japan preceded my birth, so this isn't a red line that I'm drawing, Obama said. There's no shift in position, no red line. Were simply applying the treaty.

Obama plays soccer with robot

The group of islands and rocks jutting out of the ocean is tiny and uninhabited. But the long-standing dispute over them has sent tempers flaring in Beijing and Tokyo, especially in recent years.

The area around them in the South China Sea between Taiwan and Okinawa is believed to be rich in oil resources.

Senkaku is administered by the Japanese, but the Chinese claim they are the rightful owners.

The possibility of a war over the islands has been a thorn in the side of the United States, which says it is obligated by the common security agreement to back Japan.

Obama repeatedly urged that Japan and China seek a peaceful resolution through dialogue.

A pivot toRussia and Syria

In his second term, Obama has had limited success in issuing ultimatums in the hopes of halting aggression from nations like Russia and Syria.

But he seized on the line of questioning over the islands to defend his handling of the crisis in Ukraine and Syria's bloody civil war.

Warning a new round of sanctions against Russia are teed up, the President said he doubts Moscow will honor its commitment last week in Geneva to deescalate tensions in eastern Ukraine.

Do I think they are going to do that? So far, the evidence doesn't make me hopeful, Obama said at the news conference, acknowledging Russia has yet to reverse course in the face of mounting economic pressure.

But on Syria, Obama said his policy of diplomacy first had a direct effect on the removal of 87% of that country's chemical weapons stockpiles.

The fact that we didn't have to fire a missile to get that accomplished is not a failure to uphold those international norms -- it's a success, Obama said.

Asked if he was confident with Obama's assurances on Japan's security, Abe pointed to Obama's leadership in rallying the G-7 economic powers to apply sanctions on Russia.

The missing plane

Seoul is the first of two stops on Obama's tour where citizens are coming to grips with major transportation disasters — on Saturday Obama flies to Malaysia, where government officials continue to search in vain for the Malaysian Airlines jetliner that disappeared more than a month ago.

Those officials have come under withering censure, accused of botching the search and keeping family members of those on board in the dark.

So far the White House has avoided faulting Malaysian leaders for the efforts, instead highlighting the U.S. efforts to help locate the plane.

Obama has spoken publicly about the missing plane only once, during an interview in mid-March, offering U.S. assets to help in the search.

The International Monetary Fund has approved a two-year $17.1 billion loan package for Ukraine. The immediate disbursement of $3.2 billion will allow Ukraine to avoid a potential debt default.


  The IMF’s 24-member board agreed to the two-year program to aid
  Ukraine’s troubled economy on Wednesday.



  The approval gives the green light for the immediate release of
  $3.2 billion to Ukraine, which will allow the nation not to fall
  into default, Reuters reports. More than half of that money will
  be dedicated to supporting the country's budget.



  The package will open up loans from other donors totaling around
  $15 billion. The goal is for Ukraine to use the money to
  stabilize its economy.


The authorities' economic program supported by the Fund aims
  to restore macroeconomic stability, strengthen economic
  governance and transparency, and launch sound and sustainable
  economic growth, while protecting the most vulnerable, the
  IMF said in a statement.



  IMF managing director Christine Lagarde commented on the aid
  package, stating that the plan may come with geopolitical and
  implementation risks.


On the implementation front, we are taking all the
  precautions we can in order to mitigate those risks,
  Lagarde told reporters on Wednesday. On the geopolitical
  front, clearly the bilateral international support, and the
  cooperation of all parties, will be extremely helpful to
  reinforce the position of the economy of Ukraine.”

We believe that Ukraine has an opportunity to seize the
  moment, to break away from previous practices, both from the
  fiscal, from the monetary, and from the governance point of
  view,” Lagarde added.



  Ukraine’s crisis was exacerbated after months of anti-government
  protests and Crimea’s referendum to join Russia.



  The country's economy is forecasted to contract by three percent
  due to the chaos and lack of order, according to Ukrainian
  authorities. The nation's output dropped 1.1 percent in the first
  quarter of 2014.



  The ongoing protests, especially in the east of the country, are
  not helping the nation get its economy back on track. In fact,
  Ukraine’s acting President Aleksandr Turchinov said on Wednesday
  that Kiev’s government cannot control the situation in the east of the
  country, and called to speed up the creation of regional militias
  loyal to Kiev.



  Lagarde noted that further sanctions against Russia may harm
  Ukraine's economy even further, as its neighboring country is a
  key export market for Ukraine.


Clearly on the front of sanctions, anything that undermines
  the economic situation of the country will jeopardize the
  implementation of the program, which is why we very strongly
  encourage the parties to negotiate, to come to terms,
  Lagarde said.



  'Bold program of reforms'



  Lagarde argued that Ukraine has already shown its ability to
  undertake “comprehensive reforms,” listing a few of the
  sacrifices that have been made.


“Whether it was a question of letting the exchange rate
  float, whether it was a question of reforming the procurement
  law, whether it was a question of modifying the price of gas to
  customers or to corporate. They’ve (Ukrainian government) done
  all these things to demonstrate their determination to endorse a
  very bold program of reforms,” Lagarde stated.



  The IMF money comes with stringent terms, asking for various cuts
  and economic reforms. In the case of Ukraine, the requirements
  include a 50 percent increase in the price of gas for households,
  as well as a quick pension reform and lower government spending.



  The World Bank warned on April 10 that the loan terms set by
  the IMF would cut 2014 consumption in Ukraine by 8 percent, as
  well as erode capital investment.



  The increased cost of household gas and district heating
  “will affect purchasing power and limit the government’s
  ability to boost capital spending this year. Thus, in 2014, we
  expect to see a decline in both consumption and fixed
  investment,” the World Bank said in a statement.



  Earlier in April, Ukraine’s finance minister, Oleksandr Shlapak,
  said that paying
  off debt to Russia would not be a top priority for Ukraine
  when it secured its first tranche of International Monetary (IMF)
  bailout cash.



  Ukraine’s total debt to Russia, including the $2.2 billion bill
  for gas, now stands at $16.6 billion, Prime Minister Dmitry
  Medvedev said.



  Back in December, before the Ukrainian protests turned into a
  nationwide crisis, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin announced
  that the Russian government would essentially buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt by investing in
  Ukrainian bonds, using money from Russia's National Welfare Fund.
  The announcement came after a meeting with then-President Viktor
  Yanukovich in Moscow.



  The deal included a 33 percent discount for natural gas, which
  could have save the country $7 billion in 2014. The agreement was
  hailed by then-Prime Minister Azarov as saving Ukraine from
  economic ruin.



  Protests in Kiev began in November when Ukraine backed out of a
  trade negotiation deal with the EU in favor of a debt deal with
  Russia – a move interpreted by Ukrainians as a decisive step away
  from integration with the EU.","IMF gives green light for $17 bn Ukraine aid package

We ask the Russian government to act publicly and internally for their release,” Steffen Seibert said.

People's Mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov said last week activists had detained 11 members of a military mission under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, including eight Europeans and three Ukrainians, who are suspected of “espionage.”

Ponomaryov said Monday the OSCE military observers being held as prisoners of war in Slaviansk could be freed in exchange for the release of federalization supporters taken hostage by Kiev.

  told the young lady that if he took a photo with her he’d have to
  do so with everyone else.

UN member-states have more than once spoken in favor of lifting the US blockade of Cuba. One of the documents towards that goal, a 2011 resolution on the importance of terminating the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the US on Cuba, received the support of 186 delegations at the UN.

Bruno Rodriguez said in October 2013 while taking the floor at the UN that the damage done to Cuba during half a century of sanctions had inflicted a damage of $ 1.126 trillion.

A vacation tab racked up by President Obama and Vice President Biden has gotten pretty hefty – reaching $40 million, according to a taxpayer watchdog group.


  In a statement released by Judicial Watch, the group stated it
  had gotten its hands on documentation from the US Air Force, via
  Freedom of Information Act requests, that reveals the cost of
  flying Obama and Biden alone routinely exceeds hundreds of
  thousands of dollars per hour in the air.



  According to the Washington Examiner, which obtained the release,
  the president’s two golf outings this year cost roughly $2.9
  million in taxpayer funds.



  Judicial Watch estimates that since 2009, American taxpayers have
  spent about $40 million flying Obama and Biden to various
  destinations – not just golf outings in Palm Springs, California,
  but also for vacations to Hawaii and trips to Africa.



  Additionally, the group stated that even more money is spent on
  accommodation, vehicle transportation, Secret Service protection,
  and other things. The president of Judicial Watch says the amount
  of spending amounts to abuse.

“It is clear that the Obamas continually abuse the perks of
  the president’s office at taxpayer expense,” said Tom
  Fitton, according to the Examiner. “And it is particularly
  interesting that Obama has chosen to take not one but two luxury
  vacations back-to-back while inveighing against ‘income
  equality.’ President Obama’s waste of the hard-earned tax dollars
  of working Americans on unnecessary luxury travel is an abuse of
  office.”


  This isn’t the first time the cost of the president’s travel has
  been subject to scrutiny by Judicial Watch. In March, the group
  announced that Obama’s trips to Hawaii and Africa in 2013 cost
  nearly $16 million in flight costs alone. In particular, the trip
  to Africa was criticized by some after reports indicated that,
  based on previous presidential journeys to the continent, it
  could cost between $60 million and $100 million.



  With the trip taking place as sequestration forced cuts in
  various government agencies, Obama's political opponents have
  criticized him for taking the trip while canceling White House
  tours.


“For the cost of this trip to Africa, you could have 1,350
  weeks of White House tours,” Rep. George Holding (R-N.C.)
  said at the time. “It is no secret that we need to rein in
  government spending, and the Obama administration has regularly
  and repeatedly shown a lack of judgment for when and where to
  make cuts.”


  But those with experience in planning presidential trips have
  chalked up the costs as par for the course.


“Even in the most developed places of Western Europe, the
  level of support you need for mass movements by the president is
  really extraordinary,” said Steve Atkiss, who helped
  coordinate travel under President George W. Bush, to the
  Washington Post. “As you go farther afield, to less-developed
  places, certainly it’s more of a logistical challenge.”","Fighting income inequality: Obama-Biden vacation tab reaches $40 mn

The pro-Western government in Kiev blamed Russia for what it called the kidnapping on Friday of the monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

The separatists said they suspected the observers of spying; Ukraine said they were being used as human shields.

Since Ukrainians toppled their pro-Russian president in February, Russia has annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and massed tens of thousands of troops on the country's eastern border. NATO has responded by sending reinforcements to eastern Europe, in the gravest East-West crisis since the Cold War.

Earlier on Saturday the Group of Seven major economies announced they had agreed to impose more sanctions on Russia, which they believe is bent on destabilizing its former Soviet neighbor and possibly grabbing more territory. Diplomats said the United States and the European Union were expected to unveil new punitive action against Russian individuals from Monday.

Russia denies orchestrating a campaign by pro-Moscow militants who have seized control of public buildings across eastern Ukraine. It accuses the Kiev government of whipping up tensions by sending troops to root out the separatists.

The OSCE sent more monitors on Saturday to seek the release of those detained in Slaviansk, a city under the separatists' control. Those being held are from Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Poland and the Czech Republic.

COINS TO EXCHANGE

Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, de facto mayor of Slaviansk, told reporters: They were soldiers on our territory without our permission, of course they are prisoners.

He said the separatists were ready to exchange the captured monitors for fellow rebels now in the custody of the Ukrainian authorities.

Prisoners have always been coins to exchange during times of war. It's an international practice, he said.

Ukraine's state security service said the OSCE observers - part of a German-led military verification mission deployed since early March at Kiev's request - were being held in inhuman conditions and that one needed medical help.

A spokeswoman for the Vienna-based organisation, of which Russia is a member, said the OSCE had been in contact with all sides since late on Friday but had had no direct contact with the observers.

The Russian foreign ministry said it was working to resolve the crisis, but blamed Kiev for failing to ensure the OSCE mission's safety in areas where the authorities do not control the situation and where a military operation against residents of their own country has been unleashed.

Russia's Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper released a video interview with a man it identified as Ivan Strelkov, a militia leader in Slaviansk, accused by Ukraine's security services of being an employee of Russian intelligence.

He suggested the monitors might have been using their diplomatic status to carry out reconnaissance of the resistance positions, for the benefit of the Ukrainian army.

It is standard practice for serving military officers to be seconded to OSCE missions.

DIPLOMATIC MOVES

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier discussed the Ukraine situation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov by telephone on Saturday with an accent on possible steps to de-escalate the situation, the Russian ministry said.

Steinmeier said Lavrov had offered his backing, which he welcomed.

In a separate call with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the Russian minister said Ukraine must halt military operations in the southeast of the country in order to defuse the crisis.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said Russian military aircraft entered Ukrainian airspace seven times overnight.

The only reason is to provoke Ukraine ... and to accuse Ukraine of waging war against Russia, the prime minister told reporters before cutting short a visit to Rome.

Washington deployed 150 paratroopers to Lithuania on Saturday. A total of 600 U.S. troops have now arrived in Poland and the former Soviet Baltic states in a bid to reassure nervous NATO allies.

As threats emerged, we see who our real friends are, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said as she greeted the troops at the Siauliai air base.

Without mentioning Russia, she said the presence of U.S. troops would repel those who encroach on stability in Europe and peace in the region.

The numbers are not important. If just one of our guests is harmed, this would mean an open confrontation, not with Lithuania but with the United States of America.

DOOR REMAINS OPEN

U.S. officials said new sanctions targeting cronies of President Vladimir Putin could be unveiled as early as Monday unless Russia moved fast to defuse the crisis.

In a joint statement, G7 leaders said Russia had not taken any concrete steps to implement an accord, signed earlier this month in Geneva, intended to rein in illegal armed groups.

Instead, it has continued to escalate tensions by increasingly concerning rhetoric and ongoing threatening military maneuvers on Ukraine's border, it said.

We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia.

But it added: We underscore that the door remains open to a diplomatic resolution of this crisis.

Senior EU diplomats will meet on Monday to discuss the next steps and are expected to add 15 more names to a list of Russians subject to asset freezes and a travel ban.

Putin acknowledged for the first time this week that sanctions were causing difficulties for Russia, though he said the impact was not critical.

The metro ads by the group #CubaNow are designed to highlight economic changes happening in Cuba. The group believes the 52-year-old U.S. embargo against the communist-ruled island has not worked.

It's time to bring the conversation on U.S.-Cuba policy into the 21st century, said #CubaNow director Ric Herrero.

The group said its mission, unlike other Cuba policy groups, was specifically focused on changing U.S. thinking about Cuba policy.

While the group opposes the embargo, it recognized that overturning it in Congress is an uphill battle and other ways can be found to change policy, such as allowing all Americans to travel to Cuba.

There's plenty the President can do within his existing authority, said #CubaNow founding member Andres D?­az, a Cuban-born former Obama administration official at the Department of Commerce.

#CubaNow was founded by a group of mostly younger generation Cuban Americans. Herrero declined to discuss its funding.

The group's launch coincides with the fifth anniversary of Obama's 2009 steps allowing Cuban-Americans to travel freely to visit relatives in Cuba as well as send remittances.

That policy shift helped usher in more change in that time than had been seen in the previous 50 years, the group said in a press release.

Herrero said the group, based in Miami and Washington, wants the White House to take new steps to encourage Cuba's burgeoning private sector which has emerged under economic reforms being slowly introduced by the Cuban government.

Cuba announced new reforms on Monday loosening regulation of its largest state-run companies including minerals, tourism and telecommunications.

The group's founding is part of a new wave of efforts to prod Obama into taking bolder steps to engage the Cuban government.

It follows a February poll by the Atlantic Council which found a majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba.

In November, Obama told a Miami area fundraiser that it may be time for the United States to update its policies toward Cuba.

Blue jeans and rock?ˆ?n roll brought down the Berlin Wall, so we have to recognize that there is a new wave of energy pushing a new approach toward U.S.-Cuba policy, said Alex Castellanos, a Republican political strategist who is Cuban American.

Ukraine is ready to pay its debt to Russia’s Gazprom for gas supplies at a price of 268.5 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres, acting Energy and Coal Industry Minister Yuri Prodan said.

“Ukraine is ready to pay the debt. But we cannot pay the price Gazprom set from April 1. It is unjustifiably high and is about 500 U.S. dollars. We are ready to pay under our obligations,” the minister said on Monday, April 28.

He said that the Ukrainian gas transit system would be incorporated into the European gas transportation system. “We can also use the possibilities of our underground gas storage facilities and hope that European gas companies will build up their reserves in our storage facilities,” he said.

Ukraine and Slovakia signed a memorandum of intent in Bratislava earlier in the day, agreeing to organise reverse-flow gas supplies to Ukraine.

A source familiar with the situation told ITAR-TASS that the amount of gas supplied in reverse mode might increase to 10 billion cubic metres.

The two countries also agreed to explore the possibility of reverse-flow supplies by the transit pipeline used by Gazprom to deliver gas to Europe.

According to Prodan, reverse-flow supplies can reach 8 billion cubic metres by September 1, 2014, not by 2015. Gas will be supplied by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline, not the transit pipeline.

EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said such supplies would not require the Russian company’s agreement and would give Ukraine up to 10 billion cubic metres of a gas a year but stressed that reverse-flow gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine by the trunk pipeline would be impossible without Gazprom’s consent as it would run counter to the Slovak company Eustream’s contractual obligations.

Oettinger believes that diversification of supplies will help to solve Ukraine’s gas problem in part. However reverse-flow supplies from Poland and Hungary by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline will not be enough for Ukraine get through the coming winter comfortably.

He also said that the European Union was providing support to Kiev on the repayment of its gas debt to Russia.

Meanwhile, Naftogaz of Ukraine is planning to transport gas from Poland under a contract with Germany’s RWE until the end of April and throughout May.

According to the declared volumes, Naftogaz of Ukraine is to get 4.022 million cubic metres of gas from Poland on April 15-22; 4.08 million cubic metres a day on April 23-30, and 4.022 million cubic metres on May 1-31. Up to date, Ukraine was supposed to receive about 40 million cubic meters of gas from Poland.

RWE AG resumed gas supplies to Ukraine through its division RWE Supply and Trading on April 15 under a five-year framework agreement with Naftogaz of Ukraine signed in May 2012.

“RWE supplies to Ukraine are based on the European pricing principles, including transportation costs. The agreement provides for the delivery of up to 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year,” Naftogaz of Ukraine said.

In 2013, RWE supplied about 1 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine.

The maximum amount of gas Ukraine can get from Poland is 4 million cubic metres a day. However, “RWE has reiterated its readiness to increase gas supply to Ukraine as soon as transportation restrictions are lifted on the Slovak-Ukrainian border,” Naftogaz of Ukraine said.

The European Union has promised assistance to Ukraine in diversifying natural gas supplies.

Kiev is planning to buy about 290 million cubic metres of gas in Europe in reverse mode (about 140 million cubic metres will be delivered through Poland and the rest through Hungary).

Ukraine has been receiving natural in reverse flows from Europe since November 1, 2012. The gas is supplied across the Ukrainian border with Poland under a contract with from German RWE.

The gas is supplied across the Ukrainian border with Poland. RWE planned to supply up to 5 billion cubic metres of gas to Ukraine until May 2013. Last year Naftogaz Ukrainy imported 55 million cubic metres of gas using the reverse flow scheme.

The throughput capacity of the Ukrainian gas transportation is 288 billion cubic metres system at the entrance and 178.5 billion cubic meters at the exit, including 142.5 billion cubic metres to European countries and 3.5 billion cubic metres to Moldova. Natural gas transit through Ukraine to Europe and CIS countries in 2011 increased by 5.7% from 2010 to 104,197,067,000 cubic metres, including to Western Europe by 5.9% to 101,098,013,000 cubic metres, but decreased by 2.4% to 3,099,054,000 cubic metres to CIS countries.

Ukraine’s gas transportation system consists of 72 compressor stations, 110 production shops and 1,451 gas distribution stations. The overall length of gas pipelines operated by the company is 38,600 kilometres, including 22,200 kilometres of trunk pipelines and 16,400 kilometres of extensions.

The politician said his leftwing opponents had taken out of context a comment he had made about Martin Schulz, a German who is president of the European Parliament and the center left's candidate to be the next European Commission chief.

It's surreal to attribute to me any anti-German sentiment or a presumed hostility towards the German people, with whom I am friends, Berlusconi said in a statement.

At a campaign rally on Saturday, Berlusconi described Schulz, whom he once compared to a concentration camp overseer, as unfriendly to Italy. He then added: According to the Germans, there never were concentration camps.

The latest in a long line of off-color quips from the 77-year-old billionaire has fed into the European parliamentary election campaign in which Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia party has adopted a marked anti-German tone.

Trailing both Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's center-left Democratic Party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement in the polls ahead of the next month's election, the party has blamed German Chancellor Angela Merkel for forcing Italy to adopt harsh austerity measures.

One of its campaign slogan says: More Italy, less Germany.

If I'm hostile to anything, it's to counter-productive austerity, to certain restrictions and rules which, in my opinion, are seriously mistaken and which are trapping the whole of Europe in a long economic stagnation, Berlusconi's statement said.

Sergey Mironov has demanded that State Duma deputy, Ilya Ponomaryov, quit his post as his behavior damaged the reputation of the Fair Russia party. The MP replied that he would fight for his seat ‘to the end.’


  Mironov addressed Ponomaryov in an open letter published on
  social networks, in which he quoted the MP’s own recent statement
  opposing Crimea’s accession to the Russian Federation and calling
  Russia’s support of the Crimean referendum decision “a
  hypocritical and lowly deed.”Mironov went on to cesure
  Ponomaryov’s attitude to the Fair Russia party as “immoral
  and ignoble” and called for him to give up his parliamentary
  mandate.



  Ilya Ponomaryov was the only Lower House member who voted against
  the package of bills that allowed the accession.



  Mironov wrote in the letter that the public are generally unaware
  of the legal niceties that allow Duma deputies to remain in
  parliament after quitting the parties that brought them there.
  Technically, Ponomaryov was still a member of the Fair Russia
  caucus, despite recently leaving the party and this was causing
  reputational damage to the party, Mironov claimed.



  “Speaking for the whole party, I do not request, but demand –
  stop clinging to your seat, give up the mandate!” the letter
  reads.



  In addition, the Fair Russia leader reminded Ponomaryov of the
  political legacy of his family and asked him not to tarnish his
  family’s name. Ponomaryov’s mother, Larisa Ponomaryova, was a
  long time Upper House member and his great-uncle, Boris
  Ponomaryov, was a top Communist Party official in the Soviet
  Union.



  Ilya Ponomaryov was elected to the State Duma in 2007 and in 2011
  on Fair Russia’s ticket, but their ways parted after Ponomaryov,
  along with with two other MPs, took part in mass protests against alleged violations at the 2011
  parliamentary polls. Fellow parliamentarians, including Mironov,
  said that if Ponomaryov considered the elections to be unfair he
  should not occupy the seat received in the very same elections,
  but the MP refused to leave.


Another scandal involving Ponomaryov took
  place in early 2013 when a team of investigators discovered that
  a senior vice-president of the Skolkovo innovation hub paid the
  MP $750,000 to deliver 10 lectures and one research paper. The
  probe and subsequent court hearings proved these facts to be
  true. The executive in charge was suspended and the MP was
  ordered to return the money. Ponomaryov pleaded not guilty,
  saying that the fees were fair and proportional to the amount of
  work.



  Following this second scandal, Ponomaryov announced in October
  2013 that he was quitting the Fair Russia party, but would remain
  in the State Duma as Russian law allows this.



  Ponomaryov reiterated this intention in comments to Mironov’s
  open letter – “This is not going to happen – I received this
  mandate from the voters of Novosibirsk Region and I will fight to
  the end for the interests of my region and my country,” the
  Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.



  In early April, several deputies from the nationalist party LDPR
  drafted a parliamentary statement on depriving four Fair Russia
  MPs of their places in parliament for not supporting the bills on
  Crimea’s reunification with Russia (Ponomaryov voted against and

Though Republicans hold a majority of seats in the House of Representatives and Democrats hold a majority of seats in the Senate, a majority of Americans say that neither party represents them.


  According to a new national survey by Rasmussen, 53 percent of
  likely US voters think that neither political party truly
  represents the American people. The poll shows that the two-party
  system is losing ground with Americans – six months ago, in
  October, only 46 percent of questioned voters said that neither
  party represents Americans.



  RT’s Lindsay France spoke with 2012 Libertarian Party
  presidential candidate Gary Johnson about Americans’ lack of
  representation in the halls of political power.


RT: Now let’s talk about this lack of
  representation. Seventy-two percent say it would be better if the
  country didn’t elect the incumbents to Congress this year in
  November. If they don’t trust either party, the incumbents or the
  new guys, what’s the alternative?


Gary Johnson: Well, first of all, I agree with
  the poll. I think this is what we’re all witnessing. I think term
  limits would really be a silver bullet, the notion that people
  would get in, do the right thing and get out. And then, Lindsay,
  you know, a couple of issues of late that really left all the
  politicians behind: the marriage equality, nobody was standing up
  for that; the marijuana legalization, the state of Washington,
  the state of Colorado moving ahead of all politicians; and then
  if you look at Libya and Syria, the president’s ready to go in
  militarily, Congress is ready to dot the i’s and cross the t’s on
  how to do that and, lo and behold, 80 percent of Americans don’t
  want to do that. Well that’s a good thing. I just wish that
  Congress would catch up to the fact that this spending is not
  sustainable and, if they don’t fix this, we’re going to find
  ourselves in a monetary crisis. We’re going to find ourselves
  without a country.


RT: Well, let’s talk about government trust
  among young voters, those between the ages of about 18 and 29. A
  new poll surveying young Americans’ political attitudes released
  by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics [on] Tuesday, found
  that the millennials’ 'composite trust index,' it’s called, which
  is the level of trust, on average, in six different public
  institutions: the presidency, the US military, the Supreme Court,
  the federal government, and the United Nations, it’s dropped
  dramatically in just two years...from 39 two years ago down to 31
  in mid-April...How do politicians come back from this sort of a
  drop? We’re talking about the young generation, the young voters
  here.


GJ: Lindsay, I know you have statistics there on
  young voters, but I believe that it isn’t just young voters. I
  think that they are the canary, though, in the coal mine, and
  that, if politicians don’t get in touch with this, that, really,
  we’re going to find ourselves...I do already think we’re in a
  catastrophe of sorts in that we’re not being represented. Of
  course, having run for the Libertarian nomination for president,
  I can tell you that whether you’re a Libertarian, whether you’re
  a Democrat, whether you’re a Republican, you have baggage whether
  you have that baggage or not. We’re suing the Presidential
  Debates Commission right now to say if mathematically you are a
  party that can conceivably be elected president of the United
  States with enough electoral votes, then shouldn’t you be
  included in the debates? Just give another voice out there, and
  the more voices we have with input on where this country should
  go, I suggest we’ll all be a lot better off. But it is a
  two-party system, and it’s very exclusionary. I found that out
  face-to-face. It’s not a good thing. More voices, the better. And
  I’m not being hypocritical here. As governor of New Mexico, I
  made it as easy as, I signed legislation making it as easy as
  possible for third parties to be able to run.


RT: Well, let’s talk about these other voices.
  You know, even after the midterm elections, President Obama’s got
  a while left in the White House. He’s facing very low approval ratings right now – extremely low,
  embarrassingly low. What does this midterm election look like?
  Can it change things? Will new voices, depending on who makes it
  in through the midterm elections, change his approval ratings?
  Will they be able to steer him away from some of those bad
  decisions?


GJ: Well, I don’t place blame on Obama, I do
  place blame on the system that is very status quo oriented, that
  more than anything politicians are concerned with getting
  reelected, as opposed to doing the right thing...When people
  don’t vote, it’s a, you know, that’s not a good thing. And maybe
  we’ll see some huge voter turnout. I have no optimism whatsoever
  that anything changes in Washington as a result of these midterm
  elections. Look, I think that the president should be a leader
  and that he should be controversial and that he should press the
  things that he wants to do. And Republicans, they should be
  leading on the issues that they should be strong on, and that
  would be spending and that would be the deficit. And then both
  parties, they ought to come together on issues that everybody
  cares about. I think the majority of Americans – speaking with a
  broad brushstroke – are fiscally responsible and socially
  liberal. I always tell people I’m as conservative a politician as
  you’ve ever met when it comes to dollars and cents, and I’m a
  flaming liberal when it comes to civil liberties. The
  militarization of our police forces, this is happening under the
  guise of both political parties watching this. I mean, it’s
  getting so bad. One-hundred-and-ten million Verizon users are
  being monitored by the NSA. This is happening under the eyes of
  both political parties. There just doesn’t seem to be any hope
  out there.


RT: Well, let’s talk about our foreign
  involvements, which most people will say have been numerous
  lately. As the saying goes, “Go big or go home.” Well, we’ve gone
  big, and now it appears it’s time to go home. According to nearly
  half of the respondents from an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 47
  percent of them say the US should become less active in world
  affairs. Now if you look at what’s going on: US involvement in
  Ukraine, the Iraq debacle, troop withdrawal from Afghanistan,
  trying to go into Syria, Libya before that, what is the way
  forward for those who want votes this election season, with all
  of the concern Americans feel on these issues?


GJ: Well, the way politicians address this of
  course is to get tough, drop bombs. I mean, Republicans are all
  about who’s going to drop the first bomb? What about the notion
  of free trade? Gosh, is China really an enemy when they’re, you
  know, our second biggest trading partner? I don’t think so! We
  should be looking at trade with other countries first and
  foremost...You don’t go to war against trading partners. But yet
  we’re always talking about sanctions, and sanctions just don’t
  work. And when you look at Ukraine right now, I think that would
  be analogous to Russia getting involved in Puerto Rico. They’re
  not going to do it. We shouldn’t get involved in Ukraine. There
  are unintended consequences as a result of our military
  interventions. I’m going to suggest that we have hundreds of
  millions of enemies to this country because of our military
  interventions.


RT: Well, let’s talk about Ukraine for a minute.
  Obviously it’s a hot spot in world topics...How should the US
  approach the crisis in Ukraine? Should the US do more or less?


GJ: Well, less! Look, don’t get involved in
  Ukraine! It would be like Russia getting involved in the affairs
  of Puerto Rico. They’re not going to do it! We shouldn’t be
  involved in Ukraine! There’s no national security interest here
  at stake. And I know you’ll hear politicians beating their
  chests, arguing the opposite. Well, I’m going to argue that there
  is no national security interest here at risk, and the government
  has an obligation to protect us against foreign governments that
  might do us harm – this is not one of those situations.","US involvement in Ukraine is like ‘Russia getting involved in Puerto Rico’

  presidential candidate Gary Johnson about Americans’ lack of
  representation in the halls of political power.


RT: Now let’s talk about this lack of
  representation. Seventy-two percent say it would be better if the
  country didn’t elect the incumbents to Congress this year in
  November. If they don’t trust either party, the incumbents or the
  new guys, what’s the alternative?


Gary Johnson: Well, first of all, I agree with
  the poll. I think this is what we’re all witnessing. I think term
  limits would really be a silver bullet, the notion that people
  would get in, do the right thing and get out. And then, Lindsay,
  you know, a couple of issues of late that really left all the
  politicians behind: the marriage equality, nobody was standing up
  for that; the marijuana legalization, the state of Washington,
  the state of Colorado moving ahead of all politicians; and then
  if you look at Libya and Syria, the president’s ready to go in
  militarily, Congress is ready to dot the i’s and cross the t’s on
  how to do that and, lo and behold, 80 percent of Americans don’t
  want to do that. Well that’s a good thing. I just wish that
  Congress would catch up to the fact that this spending is not
  sustainable and, if they don’t fix this, we’re going to find
  ourselves in a monetary crisis. We’re going to find ourselves
  without a country.


RT: Well, let’s talk about government trust
  among young voters, those between the ages of about 18 and 29. A
  new poll surveying young Americans’ political attitudes released
  by Harvard University’s Institute of Politics [on] Tuesday, found
  that the millennials’ 'composite trust index,' it’s called, which
  is the level of trust, on average, in six different public
  institutions: the presidency, the US military, the Supreme Court,
  the federal government, and the United Nations, it’s dropped
  dramatically in just two years...from 39 two years ago down to 31
  in mid-April...How do politicians come back from this sort of a
  drop? We’re talking about the young generation, the young voters
  here.


GJ: Lindsay, I know you have statistics there on
  young voters, but I believe that it isn’t just young voters. I
  think that they are the canary, though, in the coal mine, and
  that, if politicians don’t get in touch with this, that, really,
  we’re going to find ourselves...I do already think we’re in a
  catastrophe of sorts in that we’re not being represented. Of
  course, having run for the Libertarian nomination for president,
  I can tell you that whether you’re a Libertarian, whether you’re
  a Democrat, whether you’re a Republican, you have baggage whether
  you have that baggage or not. We’re suing the Presidential
  Debates Commission right now to say if mathematically you are a
  party that can conceivably be elected president of the United
  States with enough electoral votes, then shouldn’t you be
  included in the debates? Just give another voice out there, and
  the more voices we have with input on where this country should
  go, I suggest we’ll all be a lot better off. But it is a
  two-party system, and it’s very exclusionary. I found that out
  face-to-face. It’s not a good thing. More voices, the better. And
  I’m not being hypocritical here. As governor of New Mexico, I
  made it as easy as, I signed legislation making it as easy as
  possible for third parties to be able to run.


RT: Well, let’s talk about these other voices.
  You know, even after the midterm elections, President Obama’s got
  a while left in the White House. He’s facing very low approval ratings right now – extremely low,
  embarrassingly low. What does this midterm election look like?
  Can it change things? Will new voices, depending on who makes it
  in through the midterm elections, change his approval ratings?
  Will they be able to steer him away from some of those bad
  decisions?


GJ: Well, I don’t place blame on Obama, I do
  place blame on the system that is very status quo oriented, that
  more than anything politicians are concerned with getting
  reelected, as opposed to doing the right thing...When people
  don’t vote, it’s a, you know, that’s not a good thing. And maybe
  we’ll see some huge voter turnout. I have no optimism whatsoever
  that anything changes in Washington as a result of these midterm
  elections. Look, I think that the president should be a leader
  and that he should be controversial and that he should press the
  things that he wants to do. And Republicans, they should be
  leading on the issues that they should be strong on, and that
  would be spending and that would be the deficit. And then both
  parties, they ought to come together on issues that everybody
  cares about. I think the majority of Americans – speaking with a
  broad brushstroke – are fiscally responsible and socially
  liberal. I always tell people I’m as conservative a politician as
  you’ve ever met when it comes to dollars and cents, and I’m a
  flaming liberal when it comes to civil liberties. The
  militarization of our police forces, this is happening under the
  guise of both political parties watching this. I mean, it’s
  getting so bad. One-hundred-and-ten million Verizon users are
  being monitored by the NSA. This is happening under the eyes of
  both political parties. There just doesn’t seem to be any hope
  out there.


RT: Well, let’s talk about our foreign
  involvements, which most people will say have been numerous
  lately. As the saying goes, “Go big or go home.” Well, we’ve gone
  big, and now it appears it’s time to go home. According to nearly
  half of the respondents from an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 47
  percent of them say the US should become less active in world
  affairs. Now if you look at what’s going on: US involvement in
  Ukraine, the Iraq debacle, troop withdrawal from Afghanistan,
  trying to go into Syria, Libya before that, what is the way
  forward for those who want votes this election season, with all
  of the concern Americans feel on these issues?


GJ: Well, the way politicians address this of
  course is to get tough, drop bombs. I mean, Republicans are all
  about who’s going to drop the first bomb? What about the notion
  of free trade? Gosh, is China really an enemy when they’re, you
  know, our second biggest trading partner? I don’t think so! We
  should be looking at trade with other countries first and
  foremost...You don’t go to war against trading partners. But yet
  we’re always talking about sanctions, and sanctions just don’t
  work. And when you look at Ukraine right now, I think that would
  be analogous to Russia getting involved in Puerto Rico. They’re
  not going to do it. We shouldn’t get involved in Ukraine. There
  are unintended consequences as a result of our military
  interventions. I’m going to suggest that we have hundreds of
  millions of enemies to this country because of our military
  interventions.


RT: Well, let’s talk about Ukraine for a minute.
  Obviously it’s a hot spot in world topics...How should the US
  approach the crisis in Ukraine? Should the US do more or less?


GJ: Well, less! Look, don’t get involved in
  Ukraine! It would be like Russia getting involved in the affairs
  of Puerto Rico. They’re not going to do it! We shouldn’t be
  involved in Ukraine! There’s no national security interest here
  at stake. And I know you’ll hear politicians beating their
  chests, arguing the opposite. Well, I’m going to argue that there
  is no national security interest here at risk, and the government
  has an obligation to protect us against foreign governments that
  might do us harm – this is not one of those situations.",1636

Russia’s Gazprom is ready to supply more gas to China than the two sides are discussing but the buyer is not prepared to purchase extra volumes, Viktor Timoshilov, who is in charge of the company’s eastern projects, said on Wednesday, April 23.

“We are negotiating with China for the supply of 38 billion cubic metres of gas eastward even though we could supply more, but the buyer is not prepared to confirm the purchase of larger volumes,” he said.

The sides are negotiating supplies in the amount of 38 billion cubic metres even though previously a figure of 60 billion cubic metres was discussed.

Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said after a meeting with Zhou Jiping, Chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), in early April that the next round of talks would be held at the end of the month.

At the meeting, the parties addressed the issues of arranging Russian pipeline gas supply to China. Miller and Zhou achieved considerable progress on a contract being hammered out to supply gas via the eastern route in accordance with the previously agreed Major Terms.

“At this round of talks we approved all the project-related technical matters. We advanced in our talks on the gas price. The parties agreed that the contract would come into force before the end of 2014 and that the next round of talks would take place in Moscow in late April,” Miller said summarising the meeting results.

Gazprom may sign a contract for the supply of natural gas to China during President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Beijing in May of this year, the company said in January after a meeting between Miller and Zhou.

“Both sides are interested in the successful completion of the talks and are determined to sign the contract as soon as possible… it was proposed at the meeting that the contract should be ready for signing during the Russian president’s visit to China scheduled for May of this year,” the statement said.

The parties noted that the negotiations were progressing as per schedule and the contract would enter into force in accordance with the previously agreed Major Terms until late 2014.

In March 2013, the two companies signed a memorandum on pipeline gas supplies from Russia to China using the “eastern route.” Miller said back then that gas supplies to China could be prepaid. Given the cost of the gas transportation system to the Chinese border preliminarily appraised at 770 billion roubles, an advance payment could be as big as 25 billion U.S. dollars.

In June 2013, CNPC came up with new pricing proposals, suggesting that the price of gas be pegged to the value of Henry Hub liquefied natural gas. But Gazprom said it was not ready to do that.

The “eastern route” is an extension from the Sila Sibiri (The Force of Siberia) gas pipeline.

The main parameters of supplies are: crossing point in Blagoveshchensk; volume of supply 38 billion cubic metres with a possible increase to 60 billion cubic metres; start of supply 2018.

Over the past 10 years, natural gas consumption in China has increased from 24 billion to 100 billion cubic metres a year. There are several possible routes for bringing gas to China. Gazprom insisted that Russian gas be initially supplied to China via the “western route.”

China insisted that gas be initially supplied by the eastern route, which it believes will reduce the cost of Russian gas supplies. At this point, the cost of Russian gas deliveries, including transportation, is close to China’s offer of 250 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres.

The “western route” is the Altai gas transportation system that will supply gas from Gazprom’s gas fields. The “eastern route” can deliver gas from fields in Eastern Siberia and Sakhalin.

The agreement on strategic cooperation between Gazprom and CNPC was signed on October 14, 2004. In June 2009, the governments of Russia and China signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation in the field of natural gas.

CNPC is China's largest petroleum company wholly-owned by the state and is one of the world's leading integrated oil and gas production companies.

In 2009, Gazprom and CNPC inked the Framework Agreement on the major terms and conditions of natural gas supply from Russia to China. The Agreement stipulates annual exports of up to 68 billion cubic meters of gas to the Chinese market. In 2010 the Extended Major Terms of natural gas supply from Russia to China were signed.

NATO will have to treat Russia more as an adversary rather than a partner, a deputy secretary-general of the North Atlantic alliance said.

“Clearly the Russians have declared NATO as an adversary, so we have to begin to view Russia no longer as a partner but as more of an adversary than a partner,” Alexander Vershbow said as quoted by US media.

“In central Europe, clearly we [NATO and Russia] have two different visions of what European security should be like, Vershbow said Thursday.

He stressed that the alliance “still would defend the sovereignty and freedom of choice of Russia's neighbors” and accused Moscow of “trying to re-impose hegemony and limit their [neighboring states’] sovereignty under the guise of a defense of the Russian world.”

Vershbow told reporters that the events in Ukraine, including Crimea’s incorporation by Russia, were the reason why the relations between NATO and Russia deteriorated.

NATO suspended “practical civilian and military cooperation” with Moscow last month.

Vershbow said the alliance is considering deployment of additional forces in Eastern Europe permanently or on a rotation basis, in particular, to strengthen the security of the Baltic states.

“We want to be sure that we can come to the aid of these countries if there were any, even indirect, threat,” he said.

Earlier this week, four Danish F-16 jets landed at the Estonian airbase Amari. The Danish contingent will as part of a NATO mission patrol the Baltic states’ airspace for four months. The second part of that mission is carried out by a Polish-British contingent from the Zokniai (Siauliai) airbase in Lithuania.

Ukraine is in turmoil after a coup took place in the country in February, with new people brought to power amid deadly riots as security concerns prompted President Viktor Yanukovich to leave Ukraine.

The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, a city with a special status on the Crimean Peninsula, where most residents are Russians, struck agreements to reunify with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation.

Kiev and Western nations do not recognize Crimea’s reunification with Russia despite Moscow's repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite conformed to the international law and the UN Charter and was in line with the precedent set by Kosovo’s secession from Serbia in 2008.

After Crimea's accession to Russia, protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeastern regions, with demonstrators, who are demanding referendums on the country’s federalization, seizing some government buildings.

Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim head of state Alexander Turchinov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has condemned the operation, which is apparently aimed to crack down on federalization supporters.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday dismissed Western claims that Russia could be involved in pro-federalization protests in southeastern Ukraine.

“People say our special forces are present there [in Ukraine], say we have sent instructors there. Let me say in all responsibility that there are no Russian instructors, special forces or troops of any kind there. We have no one there,” Putin said in the Belarusian capital Minsk, where he went for integration talks with the leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan.","NEW YORK, May 02, /ITAR-TASS/.

The Pentagon cannot find a replacement for the Russian rocket engines it buys anytime soon, a senior official has revealed. The import of the engines has for now been banned via a court order lobbied by SpaceX and based on sanctions against Russia.


  Washington may soon find it problematic to continue launching its
  military satellites, as a long-time supply connection between
  Russian and US defense companies has been halted and is being
  reviewed – all because of sanctions against Moscow in connection
  with the Ukrainian crisis.



  Earlier ordered by US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, the review
  of US Air Force dependence on the Russian-made RD-180 engine,
  used in American Atlas V rockets, has not yielded any solutions.



  “We don’t have a great solution. We haven’t made any
  decisions yet,” Frank Kendall, the US undersecretary of
  defense for acquisition, was quoted as saying by Bloomberg in a
  Thursday article. The defense official spoke to the outlet after
  testifying before a Senate committee on the matter on Wednesday.



  United Launch Alliance LLC, a partnership of Lockheed Martin
  Corp. (LMT) and Boeing Co. (BA), has been purchasing RD-180
  rocket engines from joint Russian-American enterprise RD-Amross
  LLC since 1997. The engines in question have been produced at a
  plant of NPO Energomash near Moscow, and over 40 of them were
  delivered between 1997-2007 alone.



  The US has used RD-180 engines to power its Atlas III and Atlas V
  rockets, which mostly deliver commercial or military
  communications satellites, as well as reconnaissance and
  navigation satellites.



  SpaceX fighting Russia on US space market?



  So far, the replacement options outlined by the Air Force for
  Hagel have reportedly included building RD-180s in the US under
  an existing license from the Russian maker, or using different
  Delta-class rockets altogether. Each of the options has its
  drawbacks, such as the need to harness the time and know-how for
  setting up engine production in the US, or the limited production
  capability for another class of rockets, according to Kendall.



  However, even as the Pentagon has yet to come up with a definite
  decision on the issue, the banning of the Russian engine import
  is being pushed through by other US players.



  US billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX corporation on Wednesday won a
  court order temporarily blocking the Air Force from buying the
  Russian rocket engines on the grounds of a “potential
  violation” of US-imposed sanctions. The corporation says
  that by purchasing the engines, the Air Force is funneling money
  to Russia’s military industrial complex, which could be
  sponsoring some sanctioned Russian personas.



  That was only part of the April 28 complaint filed by SpaceX,
  which has been desperately trying to break into the military
  launch market. Musk has particularly been aiming to end the
  Boeing/Lockheed-Martin monopoly on launching military satellites
  in the US.



  Speaking at a congressional hearing in March, Musk alleged that
  such launches may be at risk due to the dependence on the Russian
  engine.



  There has not, however, been any indication that Russia could
  stop the production of engines already agreed upon under the
  latest contract, nor did the US freeze their delivery. The
  Wednesday court decision did not cover existing contracts or
  payments either.



  Despite Washington’s recently ratcheted-up rhetoric on sanctions
  against Russia, Bloomberg learned that five more RD-180 engines
  are still due to be delivered this year. The further deliveries
  could come under question at least temporarily, as, according to
  Pentagon spokeswoman Maureen Schumann, the United Launch Alliance
  has already stockpiled a two-year supply of the engines.","Pentagon says it cannot replace imported Russian rocket engines

Russia will not engage in political bargaining with the Ukrainian government over its decision to cut off Crimea's water supply, Russian natural resources minister Sergey Donskoy said.

“The situation clearly shows that Kiev is unfriendly towards
  the people of Crimea. We’re not surprised by this as recent
  developments characterize the regime in Kiev as
  anti-popular,” Donskoy said, as quoted by Itar-Tass news
  agency.
  
  Moscow will not take part in political bargaining because
  “it’s the ordinary people who suffer” from water
  shortages, the minister said as he arrived in the city of
  Sevastopol.
  
  Donskoy stressed that Crimea's agricultural industry is most
  affected in the current situation, but added that “we’ll find
  ways to compensate the water demands.”“In Crimea, a lot of water is wasted. It’s dumped into the
  sea. There’s no water recycling in place, which would enable us
  to use water for technical needs after preliminary
  processing,” he said.
  
  The minister added that Crimea's water supply system is in rather
  bad shape after decades of Ukrainian rule.
  
  “Today we examined the Feodosiya reservoir where over 70 percent
  of the water is unusable,” he explained.
  
  According to the minister, the water supply system in Crimea will
  be modernized by the Russian government, taking into account the
  specific features of each region of the peninsula.
  
  He added that groundwater reserves will help satisfy Crimea's
  needs.


“But we must use all available options,” the minister
  said, underlining the importance of reconstructing the existing
  facilities. Donskoy said this will be less expensive than
  erecting large desalination plants for sea water, which he called
  “the last option to be considered.”
  On Saturday, the coup-imposed Kiev government cut off water
  supply through the North-Crimean Channel, which delivers water
  from the Dnieper River to Crimea.
  
  Crimea’s Prime Minister Sergey Aksenov was quick to state that
  “there are no problems with drinking water. Agricultural
  producers will be compensated for their losses.”
  Crimea, which is dependent on Ukraine for 85 percent of its
  freshwater, offered an advance payment for the water from the
  Dnieper River. However, the talks were sabotaged by Kiev.
  
  The relevant documents were sent to Ukraine's water management
  agency on five occasions, but were returned as
  “far-fetched” excuses, Vitaly Nakhlupin, head of the

  The ultranationalist coup in Kiev prompted the Crimean peninsula
  – home to an ethnic Russian majority – to hold a referendum on
  its future within Ukraine.

Residents of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk have lashed out at troops entering the city’s streets with outrage and insults. The soldiers were supposed to be liberating the people from pro-Russian terrorists,” according to the Kiev government.


  The ongoing military crackdown on anti-government activists in
  eastern Ukraine has been portrayed as a noble quest of freeing
  the locals “kept hostage” by the so-called
  “terrorists” and “separatists.” Coup-imposed
  Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov recently branded the
  campaign “an anti-terrorist operation against the sabotage
  group of the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the Russian
  Federation” on his Facebook page.
  
  Curiously, however, eastern Ukrainians “liberated” by
  the Kiev troops have not at all been grateful for the armored
  vehicles roaming through their cities and military men with and
  without insignia shooting at supporters of the self-proclaimed
  Donetsk Republic. Dozens of armed self-defense activists and
  unarmed civilians supporting them have reportedly been injured or
  killed since the start of the military operation in the Donetsk
  Region, where many people have openly rallied in favor of a
  referendum on autonomy from Kiev.



  In the city of Kramatorsk, which for weeks has been an active
  stronghold of anti-government sentiments, locals took to the
  streets after Ukrainian troops arrived on APCs and forced
  self-defense troops to a small cluster in the central square.



  Defiant of the armed vehicles and sniper rifles pointed at them, residents were filmed
  approaching the troops to have their say.
  “Fascists! Fascists!” the locals chanted, casting
  insults on the troops and the Kiev government. Kiev authorities
  are commonly referred to as the “fascist junta” in the
  east of the country, because of their takeover of power in
  February and the government's alliance with nationalists –
  including the notorious Right Sector radical group.
  “What kind of law and order are you bringing here?! We are
  the f*****g residents of the Donetsk Region, not you!” one
  man shouted. Many of the soldiers interviewed by RT stringer
  Graham Phillips revealed they had come from western Ukrainian
  regions, including Lvov and Ivano-Frankovsk. Kiev has been
  apparently relying on regional and ethnic differences in Ukraine
  while launching the military action, as a large part of eastern
  Ukrainian armed forces and police have been unwilling
  “to fire at our own people.”
  The crowd in Kramatorsk grew even angrier as one of the Ukrainian
  APCs rammed a road sign, bringing it down.
  “Off to your Kiev! You are not welcome here! Get out! It is
  our land!” residents shouted.
  
  The troops could then be seen suddenly mounting the APCs and
  leaving the area. The crowd rushed to chase them, shouting
  “Donbass! Donbass! Glory to Donbass!”.



  The historical Russian region, which spans through several modern
  eastern Ukrainian regions and is commonly associated with its
  mining industry and metallurgy, Donbass became part of the
  Ukrainian SSR at the beginning of the Soviet era, but has
  nevertheless retained a strong local identity.
  
  According to a common stereotype, most residents of the
  strongly-industrial region believe they are the real breadwinners
  of Ukraine, “feeding” the western part of the country. The notion
  is ridiculed by western Ukrainians, some of whom call residents
  of Donetsk Region “ignorant” and “brainwashed”
  people.



  Now many of the locals are rejecting the rule of the coup-imposed
  Kiev government, which is dominated by parties relying on popular
  support in western and, to a lesser extent, central Ukraine. The
  fact that much of the eastern population is Russian-speaking and
  has cultural and family ties with Russia has been used for
  delegitimizing the popular protests as “pro-Russian
  insurgency” in Ukrainian and Western media. However, despite
  accusations of “separatism,” most people protesting in
  eastern Ukraine have been preaching for the federalization of the
  country and for an autonomous rule – not for joining Russia.



  At least six people have been killed and 15 injured since the
  start of the Kiev military operation in Kramatorsk on Friday,
  according to Donetsk Regional Administration. The local
  self-defense unit contradicts the official count, saying that 10
  people were killed in fighting overnight and at least two others
  were shot by government snipers during street battles on
  Saturday.","‘Fascists! Off to Kiev!’: Outraged Kramatorsk locals chase off Ukrainian military (VIDEO)

One of the solutions would be supplying water from Russia’s southern Kuban region by building a pipeline. However, Belousov said this would be an “exotic” option.

Another solution would be “drilling wells and using the existing water reservoirs”.

The Ukrainian authorities reduced water supplies to Crimea last week alleging the peninsula owned Kiev a large sum for water.

However, Crimean Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov said restrictions on the supply of water to Crimea were an act of sabotage on the part of Ukraine.

“Ukraine’s act of sabotage to limit the supply of water to the republic through the North Crimean Canal is nothing but a deliberate action against Crimeans,” he said.

Aksyonov said “negotiations are underway with Ukraine at the federal level” to resolve the issue. “There are backup plans. In any case, Crimea will not be left without water. As for drinking water, there are no problems with it,” he said.

“The federal budget is ready to compensate agricultural producers for possible losses,” Aksyonov said. He recalled that this issue had been discussed with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak. “Special conditions have been created for Crimea. No one will be left without help,” the prime minister said.

“We are also considering an alternative plan for drilling wells and we are working on this day and night,” he added.

Aksyonov stressed that “the persons who have seized power in Ukraine, including former residents of Crimea, Senchenko and Kunitsyn, are acting like enemies trying to cause their former fellow citizens harm. But they will get a proper assessment from the people of Crimea and will always be persona non-grata in the republic. Usually, those who mischief hatch, mischief catch,” he said.

According to Ukrainian news agencies, Kiev has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85% of fresh water from this canal, which was built in 1961-1971.

“There is no and will be no shortage of drinking water in Crimea. But there will certainly be losses in agriculture. We can’t say that the agricultural season has been wrecked, but there will certainly be losses,” Temirgaliyev said.

He said work was underway to draft a drip irrigation programme to save water. “We hope it will be implemented by the next agricultural year,” he added.","“Crimea can be independent in terms of water supply, but it will cost 10-15 billion roubles ($247-417 million),” he said on Monday, April 28.

?Over 2,000 coal miners in Lugansk region have been on strike for the second day running, demanding higher wages and refusing to accept a pay cut to fund the restoration of Kiev, which suffered damage during the coup that overthrew the government.


  Some 80 percent of miners from five coal mines belonging to
  Krasnodonugol enterprise in the city of Krasnodon have not
  shown up to work. The mines are all owned by one of Ukraine's
  richest man, Rinat Akhmetov of the mining and metallurgical
  Metinvest corporation.



  Angry miners are pressing for wage increases to match region's
  average pay, better social and living conditions and higher
  social bonuses. According to the strikers they get between 3,000
  ($260) and 6,000 hryvnas ($520), while the average salary in the
  coal industry in the region is up to 10,000 hryvnas ($860).



  Miners are also refusing to pay a 10 percent tax on their
  salaries, imposed by the post-coup authorities to restore the
  Maidan square in Kiev. The square and nearby buildings suffered
  significant damage during months of rallies and the violent
  standoff that led to a coup in February.



  According to local media reports miners have seen around a 10
  percent cut in their paychecks to restore the Ukrainian capital.


“I don't understand why are we involved!” one of the
  protesting miners, Stanislav Denisenko told ITAR-TASS. “It
  was not us who dismantled the stones and burned the houses down.
  I get about 3,000 hryvnas a month. I don't understand why they
  are taking away my salary.”


  Local media also reports that protests also demand the
  reinstatement of a few dozen of their colleagues who they say
  have been fired from their jobs for taking part in
  pro-federalization rallies in the region.



  While the coal sector workers mainly remain apolitical, some
  still question the legitimacy of the Kiev government.


“We are also against Kiev's junta. We do not recognize their
  authority. It is not legitimate. We stand for the memory of our
  ancestors fighting alongside Russians. We're all Slavs. We are
  one nation. We do not have heroes such as Bandera and Shukhevych.
  We are against these people because they are destroying our
  history,” one of the protesters said during the second day
  of the strike.



  The prosecutor’s office in Krasnodon is now conducting an
  investigation into the legal compliance and requirements for
  miners fair pay. The company is locked in negotiations with the
  strikers.



  International relations expert Mark Sleboda told RT that Kiev
  cannot afford losing control of “the real bread winner of the
  Ukraine” – the mining industry.


“The mining industry employs about 500,000 people throughout
  the region, provides about 15 percent of the country's GDP and
  coal alone is 30 percent of Ukraine's energy consumption,”
  Sleboda says.","Ukraine coal miners on strike, refuse to pay Kiev coup damages bill

Any manifestation of democracy in Iraq was inevitably accompanied by bloodletting, as parliamentary elections closed on Wednesday. The day marked the first polls since US withdrawal amid unrelenting sectarian violence.


  The turnout was predictably low, with only 30 percent out of the
  22 million eligible attending, according to senior election
  commission member, Muqdad al-Shuraifi, in the final four hours of
  the poll.



  In the current situation, even a successful attempt to bring
  people out to vote is no guarantee of quick results. The country
  is as fragmented politically as it is on the battlefield. Based
  on recent experience, even if voting demonstrates the success of
  democracy, a working coalition will take a great deal of time to
  establish. It took nine months to agree after the last election
  in 2010. That was when the United States was still around.



  Iraqis were voting to elect a 328-seat parliament, with more than
  9,000 candidates vying for spots, as the incumbent prime minister
  of eight years, Nouri al-Maliki will seek a third term. He was
  among the first to cast his vote today in the Green Zone, where
  the government is based. Addressing his nation, he was quoted by
  reporters as saying, “I call upon the Iraqi people to head in
  large numbers to the ballot boxes to send a message of deterrence
  and a slap to the face of terrorism.”


  Today, in central Baghdad, security was ramped up, with voter
  searches performed before anyone was allowed inside polling
  stations. Police blocks and barbed wire line the capital’s
  streets. However, the day did not pass without violent incident
  and explosions scattered the country.



  While the seemingly futile attempts at political order are made,
  chaos and disorder reign across the country. Voting in parts of
  the west has been canceled due to increased violence. In
  Fallujah, Sunni anti-government sentiment is marked by popular
  calls to rise up, showing just how difficult an inclusive
  political process is at this time.



  Iraq’s security forces have not been successful after months of
  trying to take areas like the province of Anbar from the clutches
  of armed extremists. It has become a focal point of Sunni
  discontent.



  Attacks have been taking place with a steady regularity -
  especially on electoral officials. Wednesday afternoon saw two
  roadside bombs go off in the north of the country, killing two
  staff from the electoral commission, further wounding two
  security officers, according to an army general. The attack took
  place to the north-west of the ethnically-mixed city of Kirkuk.
  Another two electoral stations were attacked with RPGs on the
  outskirts of Baghdad, as well as one in Mosul, 400km north of the
  capital - killing one. The total death toll from the Wednesday
  attacks stands at 11 at the time of publication.



  A string of attacks took 24 lives across the country on Tuesday
  as well – the worst was a double bombing that killed 17 people in
  an outdoor market just outside Baghdad, in which most of the
  victims belonged to the Kurdish minority.



  This follows Monday’s carnage, which claimed a further 50 in a
  wave of suicide attacks by militants disguised as security force
  members. Most of these targeted election campaigns.



  2014 saw the deadliest April since 2008, and 4,000 lives have
  been lost since the start of this year alone, as the Shia
  government forces of al-Maliki engage a Sunni opposition. More
  than 400,000 have been displaced.



  Al-Maliki’s party rose to prominence in 2006, just as violence
  started to really spiral out of control, with Sunni and Shia
  militants constantly striking each other’s populations. His party
  is expected to win the most seats on Wednesday, but is still
  unlikely to take a majority.


“Our victory is confirmed,” Reuters quoted him as
  saying, “but we are still talking about how big this victory
  will be.” This victory will depend on the PM’s ability to
  get a coalition together, and given the criticism he has received
  from nearly all ethnic and political denominations in the
  country, that is unlikely to happen, even amid an atmosphere of
  Al-Qaeda-inspired violence by groups like The Islamic State of
  Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which puts him in a unique position
  to be cast in the role of the defender of Shiites against
  extremist Sunni elements.



  Despite the elections offering hope of a way forward, “the
  fear is that it’ll only fan the flames of discontent. The prime
  minster has been accused of being too authoritarian… of making
  sectarian divisions worse, instead of better,” RT’s Lucy
  Kafanov reports. “But the opposition is too fractured to
  mount a serious challenge.”


  Since the violence of 2006, and up until 2008, the situation had
  somewhat calmed down, as the Americans reigned in the Sunni
  opposition, using their help to fight the more extreme, terrorist
  elements. But the Sunni-Shia animosity has since come back worse
  than ever, as Sunni Iraqis are complaining against discrimination
  by the government. That is aside from the already existing
  criticism of corruption and failures on all fronts, from
  infrastructure to health to education and the economy.



  These are not only the first democratic elections since the US
  military pullout – they’re also the fourth since former leader
  Saddam Hussein’s ouster in 2003. It is becoming clear to some
  that any chances of stability, political or otherwise, have
  actually decreased since the time the start of the American
  occupation.


“If Iraq had gone through this transition to a perfect
  peaceful united government, they would still be faced with a
  very, very difficult legacy of complete destruction of the
  country’s infrastructure, the toxic legacy of depleted uranium
  and things like that. And there’s the psychological trauma of the
  whole population that was bombarded by the US military,”
  Iraq war veteran Mike Prysner told RT.


“Their lives are still dominated by the violence of
  war,” Prysner said.



  Political scientist, Iraq War veteran and former US Marine Jake
  Diliberto believes this vote is not an indication of change, but
  a barely useful attempt to path up a sectarian hole that’s been
  left by the American occupation.


“Political elections going on in Iraq is going to bring two
  possible problems and two possible very good events: the first
  and biggest problem is sectarian tensions; the other problem is
  that Al-Qaeda could demonstrate itself as a powerful force by
  bombing election cycles, putting fear and intimidation into
  communities,” which could lead many to boycott the elections
  out of fear, Diliberto believes.



  He sees the continuing spiral of brutality and government
  powerlessness as arising out of a combination of two things:
  “because of long-term traditional problems within the
  sectarian communities and because of the US inability to bring
  political results post-2003 invasion.”","Iraq’s first election since US pullout marked by death over political optimism

  streets. However, the day did not pass without violent incident
  and explosions scattered the country.



  While the seemingly futile attempts at political order are made,
  chaos and disorder reign across the country. Voting in parts of
  the west has been canceled due to increased violence. In
  Fallujah, Sunni anti-government sentiment is marked by popular
  calls to rise up, showing just how difficult an inclusive
  political process is at this time.



  Iraq’s security forces have not been successful after months of
  trying to take areas like the province of Anbar from the clutches
  of armed extremists. It has become a focal point of Sunni
  discontent.



  Attacks have been taking place with a steady regularity -
  especially on electoral officials. Wednesday afternoon saw two
  roadside bombs go off in the north of the country, killing two
  staff from the electoral commission, further wounding two
  security officers, according to an army general. The attack took
  place to the north-west of the ethnically-mixed city of Kirkuk.
  Another two electoral stations were attacked with RPGs on the
  outskirts of Baghdad, as well as one in Mosul, 400km north of the
  capital - killing one. The total death toll from the Wednesday
  attacks stands at 11 at the time of publication.



  A string of attacks took 24 lives across the country on Tuesday
  as well – the worst was a double bombing that killed 17 people in
  an outdoor market just outside Baghdad, in which most of the
  victims belonged to the Kurdish minority.



  This follows Monday’s carnage, which claimed a further 50 in a
  wave of suicide attacks by militants disguised as security force
  members. Most of these targeted election campaigns.



  2014 saw the deadliest April since 2008, and 4,000 lives have
  been lost since the start of this year alone, as the Shia
  government forces of al-Maliki engage a Sunni opposition. More
  than 400,000 have been displaced.



  Al-Maliki’s party rose to prominence in 2006, just as violence
  started to really spiral out of control, with Sunni and Shia
  militants constantly striking each other’s populations. His party
  is expected to win the most seats on Wednesday, but is still
  unlikely to take a majority.


“Our victory is confirmed,” Reuters quoted him as
  saying, “but we are still talking about how big this victory
  will be.” This victory will depend on the PM’s ability to
  get a coalition together, and given the criticism he has received
  from nearly all ethnic and political denominations in the
  country, that is unlikely to happen, even amid an atmosphere of
  Al-Qaeda-inspired violence by groups like The Islamic State of
  Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which puts him in a unique position
  to be cast in the role of the defender of Shiites against
  extremist Sunni elements.



  Despite the elections offering hope of a way forward, “the
  fear is that it’ll only fan the flames of discontent. The prime
  minster has been accused of being too authoritarian… of making
  sectarian divisions worse, instead of better,” RT’s Lucy
  Kafanov reports. “But the opposition is too fractured to
  mount a serious challenge.”


  Since the violence of 2006, and up until 2008, the situation had
  somewhat calmed down, as the Americans reigned in the Sunni
  opposition, using their help to fight the more extreme, terrorist
  elements. But the Sunni-Shia animosity has since come back worse
  than ever, as Sunni Iraqis are complaining against discrimination
  by the government. That is aside from the already existing
  criticism of corruption and failures on all fronts, from
  infrastructure to health to education and the economy.



  These are not only the first democratic elections since the US
  military pullout – they’re also the fourth since former leader
  Saddam Hussein’s ouster in 2003. It is becoming clear to some
  that any chances of stability, political or otherwise, have
  actually decreased since the time the start of the American
  occupation.


“If Iraq had gone through this transition to a perfect
  peaceful united government, they would still be faced with a
  very, very difficult legacy of complete destruction of the
  country’s infrastructure, the toxic legacy of depleted uranium
  and things like that. And there’s the psychological trauma of the
  whole population that was bombarded by the US military,”
  Iraq war veteran Mike Prysner told RT.


“Their lives are still dominated by the violence of
  war,” Prysner said.



  Political scientist, Iraq War veteran and former US Marine Jake
  Diliberto believes this vote is not an indication of change, but
  a barely useful attempt to path up a sectarian hole that’s been
  left by the American occupation.


“Political elections going on in Iraq is going to bring two
  possible problems and two possible very good events: the first
  and biggest problem is sectarian tensions; the other problem is
  that Al-Qaeda could demonstrate itself as a powerful force by
  bombing election cycles, putting fear and intimidation into
  communities,” which could lead many to boycott the elections
  out of fear, Diliberto believes.



  He sees the continuing spiral of brutality and government
  powerlessness as arising out of a combination of two things:
  “because of long-term traditional problems within the
  sectarian communities and because of the US inability to bring
  political results post-2003 invasion.”",1263

The Ukrainian offensive amounts to the first time Kiev's troops have used lethal force to recapture territory from the fighters, who have seized swathes of eastern Ukraine since April 6 and proclaimed an independent People's Republic of Donetsk.

Ukraine's acting president accused Moscow of supporting terrorism at the state level against his country for backing the rebels, who the government blames for kidnapping and torturing a politician found dead on Saturday.

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said its forces backed by the army had removed three checkpoints manned by armed groups in the separatist-controlled city of Slaviansk.

During the armed clash up to five terrorists were eliminated, it said in a statement, adding that one person had been wounded on the side of the government forces.

A rebel spokeswoman in Slaviansk said two fighters had died in a clash in the same area, northeast of the city center. Slaviansk's separatist self-proclaimed mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, quoted on a local news site, said one man was shot dead and another badly wounded on the northeastern outskirts of the city. He said the dead had been unarmed.

The Kremlin, which says it has the right to invade its neighbor to protect Russian speakers, has built up forces on Ukraine's border - estimated by NATO at up to 40,000 troops.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu announced Moscow had launched military drills near the border in response to Ukraine's military machine and NATO exercises in eastern Europe. Kiev demanded an explanation within 48 hours of action on the border.

Russia already seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine last month after President Vladimir Putin overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy by announcing the right to use military force in neighboring countries.

An invasion of mainland Ukraine's industrial heartland would be a far more serious action. It had seemed beyond contemplation only weeks ago but now looks like a real threat, although the full extent of Putin's territorial ambitions remains a mystery.

In St Petersburg, Putin said that if the authorities in Kiev had used the army in eastern Ukraine, it would be a very serious crime against their own people.

It is just a punitive operation and it will of course incur consequences for the people making these decisions, including (an effect) on our interstate relations, Putin said in a televised meeting with regional media.

Washington criticized the Russian drills on the frontier. It was exactly the opposite of what we have been calling on the Russians to do, which is to de-escalate the situation, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said.

Russia's Foreign Ministry responded that it was up to Washington to halt the Ukrainian military action, and force the Kiev authorities, who are wards of the United States, to restrain themselves and not use force.

Reuters journalists saw a Ukrainian detachment with five armored personnel carriers take over a checkpoint on a road north of Slaviansk in the late morning after it was abandoned by separatists who set tires alight to cover their retreat.

However, two hours later the troops pulled back and it was unclear if Kiev would risk storming Slaviansk, a city of 130,000 that has become the military stronghold of a movement seeking annexation by Moscow of Ukraine's industrialized east.

FINISH WHAT WE HAVE STARTED

At another checkpoint set up by the Ukrainian military, a soldier said they were there to instill law and order.

Those separatists, they violated the constitution, they are torturing the country, they violated laws, they do not recognize the authority of police, so the army had to move in and we will finish what we have started so help me God, he said.

Under an accord signed by Russia, Ukraine, the United States and European Union in Geneva last week, illegal armed groups are supposed to disarm and go home, including the rebels occupying about a dozen buildings in the largely Russian-speaking east.

However, the rebels have shown no sign of retreating. U.S. President Barack Obama blamed Russia for failing to carry out the Geneva deal and said he was ready to impose new sanctions.

Putin said sanctions were dishonorable and destroyed the global economy but that so far the damage had not been critical.

Moscow also flexed its economic muscles, with the government suggesting foreign firms which pull out of the country may not be able to get back in. A source at Gazprom said the Russian exporter had slapped an additional $11.4 billion bill on Kiev. Ukraine is negotiating to reverse east-west pipelines so that it can receive gas from Europe if Moscow cuts it off.

Washington accuses Moscow of sending agents to coordinate the unrest in the east, as it did before seizing Crimea last month. Russia denies it is behind the uprising and says the separatists are responding spontaneously to hostility from Kiev. Russia made similar denials over Crimea until Putin acknowledged last week his troops had indeed acted alongside local militia.

At the state level, Russia is supporting terrorism in our country, Ukraine's acting President Oleksander Turchinov said in an address to the nation on Thursday. Armed criminals have taken over buildings, are taking citizens, Ukrainian and foreign journalists, hostage and murdering Ukrainian patriots.

Turchinov called for the eastern offensive this week after the apparent torture and murder of a pro-Kiev town councilor whose body was found on Saturday near Slaviansk.

Volodymyr Rybak had disappeared after being filmed trying to take down a separatist flag while trying to enter the rebel-held town hall where he worked in Horlivka, a town near Slaviansk.

He was bruised and punctured from head to toe...it's clear they tortured him, said Aleksander Yaroshenko, a family friend who accompanied Rybak's widow when she identified his body at the morgue. The police have lots of details, they have CCTV footage, they should know who did this, he told Reuters.

Rebels in Slaviansk released U.S. citizen Simon Ostrovsky, one of three journalists they are believed to be holding.

Moscow called for Kiev to release political prisoners, including a pro-Russian activist named Pavel Gubarev.

So far, the United States and EU have taken only mild action against Moscow, imposing visa bans and asset freezes on a few Russians, measures Moscow has scoffed at as meaningless. Washington and Brussels both say they are drafting more serious sanctions and will impose them if the Geneva deal collapses.

Even without serious sanctions, Russia's confrontation with the West has hurt its economy as fearful investors send their money abroad. Mutual funds specializing in Russia and Eastern Europe were the 30 worst performers out of 3,489 equity funds for sale in Britain in the three months ending in March.

In NATO member Poland, the first group of a contingent of around 600 U.S. soldiers arrived on Wednesday, part of an effort by Washington to reassure eastern European allies who are worried by the Russian build-up near Ukraine's borders.

However, NATO and the United States have made clear they will not use military force to protect Ukraine itself.

Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said aircraft would fly increased patrols near the Ukrainian frontier as part of the new exercises. Two local residents in the area told Reuters they had seen attack helicopters flying in formation.

Kiev said the city hall in another eastern town, Mariupol, which had been seized, was back under central control. A separatist crowd later surrounded the building, patrolled by police but otherwise apparently empty.

Kiev also reported a shootout overnight in another part of the east where a Ukrainian soldier was wounded.

Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, slid into unrest late last year when Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich rejected a pact to build closer ties with Europe. Protesters took over central Kiev and he fled in February. Days later, Russian troops seized control of Crimea.

The Ukrainian defence ministry confirmed its involvement in the operation around Slaviansk on Thursday, saying the troops involved were airborne units with experience of such tasks from international peacekeeping missions.

The morale of our forces will allow them to completely fulfill their task of defending Ukraine, it said.

Unarmed mediators from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe are in eastern Ukraine trying to persuade pro-Russian gunmen to go home, in line with the Geneva accord.

Reuters reporters have not been able to establish that any Russian troops or special forces members are on the ground, though Kiev and Western powers say they have growing evidence that Moscow has a presence. Masked gunmen in the east, widely referred to as green men, wear uniforms without insignia.

Kiev has been cautious in taking action for fear of triggering a Russian invasion. Last week it ordered an anti-terrorist operation, but this quickly fizzled out when an armored column of paratroopers surrendered weapons to a separatist crowd.

The Ukrainian offensive amounts to the first time Kiev's troops have used lethal force to recapture territory from the fighters, who have seized swathes of eastern Ukraine since April 6 and proclaimed an independent People's Republic of Donetsk.

Ukraine's acting president accused Moscow of supporting terrorism at the state level against his country for backing the rebels, who the government blames for kidnapping and torturing a politician found dead on Saturday.

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said its forces backed by the army had removed three checkpoints manned by armed groups in the separatist-controlled city of Slaviansk.

During the armed clash up to five terrorists were eliminated, it said in a statement, adding that one person had been wounded on the side of the government forces.

A rebel spokeswoman in Slaviansk said two fighters had died in a clash in the same area, northeast of the city center. Slaviansk's separatist self-proclaimed mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, quoted on a local news site, said one man was shot dead and another badly wounded on the northeastern outskirts of the city. He said the dead had been unarmed.

The Kremlin, which says it has the right to invade its neighbor to protect Russian speakers, has built up forces on Ukraine's border - estimated by NATO at up to 40,000 troops.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu announced Moscow had launched military drills near the border in response to Ukraine's military machine and NATO exercises in eastern Europe. Kiev demanded an explanation within 48 hours of action on the border.

Russia already seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine last month after President Vladimir Putin overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy by announcing the right to use military force in neighboring countries.

An invasion of mainland Ukraine's industrial heartland would be a far more serious action. It had seemed beyond contemplation only weeks ago but now looks like a real threat, although the full extent of Putin's territorial ambitions remains a mystery.

In St Petersburg, Putin said that if the authorities in Kiev had used the army in eastern Ukraine, it would be a very serious crime against their own people.

It is just a punitive operation and it will of course incur consequences for the people making these decisions, including (an effect) on our interstate relations, Putin said in a televised meeting with regional media.

Washington criticized the Russian drills on the frontier. It was exactly the opposite of what we have been calling on the Russians to do, which is to de-escalate the situation, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said.

Russia's Foreign Ministry responded that it was up to Washington to halt the Ukrainian military action, and force the Kiev authorities, who are wards of the United States, to restrain themselves and not use force.

Reuters journalists saw a Ukrainian detachment with five armored personnel carriers take over a checkpoint on a road north of Slaviansk in the late morning after it was abandoned by separatists who set tires alight to cover their retreat.

However, two hours later the troops pulled back and it was unclear if Kiev would risk storming Slaviansk, a city of 130,000 that has become the military stronghold of a movement seeking annexation by Moscow of Ukraine's industrialized east.

FINISH WHAT WE HAVE STARTED

At another checkpoint set up by the Ukrainian military, a soldier said they were there to instill law and order.

Those separatists, they violated the constitution, they are torturing the country, they violated laws, they do not recognize the authority of police, so the army had to move in and we will finish what we have started so help me God, he said.

Under an accord signed by Russia, Ukraine, the United States and European Union in Geneva last week, illegal armed groups are supposed to disarm and go home, including the rebels occupying about a dozen buildings in the largely Russian-speaking east.

However, the rebels have shown no sign of retreating. U.S. President Barack Obama blamed Russia for failing to carry out the Geneva deal and said he was ready to impose new sanctions.

Putin said sanctions were dishonorable and destroyed the global economy but that so far the damage had not been critical.

Moscow also flexed its economic muscles, with the government suggesting foreign firms which pull out of the country may not be able to get back in. A source at Gazprom said the Russian exporter had slapped an additional $11.4 billion bill on Kiev. Ukraine is negotiating to reverse east-west pipelines so that it can receive gas from Europe if Moscow cuts it off.

Washington accuses Moscow of sending agents to coordinate the unrest in the east, as it did before seizing Crimea last month. Russia denies it is behind the uprising and says the separatists are responding spontaneously to hostility from Kiev. Russia made similar denials over Crimea until Putin acknowledged last week his troops had indeed acted alongside local militia.

At the state level, Russia is supporting terrorism in our country, Ukraine's acting President Oleksander Turchinov said in an address to the nation on Thursday. Armed criminals have taken over buildings, are taking citizens, Ukrainian and foreign journalists, hostage and murdering Ukrainian patriots.

Turchinov called for the eastern offensive this week after the apparent torture and murder of a pro-Kiev town councilor whose body was found on Saturday near Slaviansk.

Volodymyr Rybak had disappeared after being filmed trying to take down a separatist flag while trying to enter the rebel-held town hall where he worked in Horlivka, a town near Slaviansk.

He was bruised and punctured from head to toe...it's clear they tortured him, said Aleksander Yaroshenko, a family friend who accompanied Rybak's widow when she identified his body at the morgue. The police have lots of details, they have CCTV footage, they should know who did this, he told Reuters.

Rebels in Slaviansk released U.S. citizen Simon Ostrovsky, one of three journalists they are believed to be holding.

Moscow called for Kiev to release political prisoners, including a pro-Russian activist named Pavel Gubarev.

He said that the Geneva agreement remained on paper as Russia had done nothing to implement its terms.

Ukraine took certain steps in this regard such as gearing down anti-terrorism operations, drafting an amnesty law, ensuring evacuation of government buildings and streets seized by various groups, embarking on a constitutional reform for local administrative bodies, and making things easier for the OSCE mission.

How State Dept. exposes itself to propaganda — RT Op-Edge","Who's really 'presenting lies as facts'? How State Dept. exposes itself to propaganda — RT Op-EdgeWho's really 'presenting lies as facts'? How State Dept. exposes itself to propaganda

Mr. Richard Stengel, the US Under Secretary of State who wrote such an impassioned “takedown” of RT in the US State Department blog, did get one thing right.


  Propaganda IS the deliberate dissemination of information that
  you know to be false or misguided.



  And boy, does Mr. Stengel make a valiant attempt at propagandizing,
  because anyone would be hard-pressed to cram more falsehoods into
  a hundred words:



  “From assertions that peaceful protesters hired snipers to
  repeated allegations that Kiev is beset by violence, fascism and
  anti-Semitism, these are lies falsely presented as news. (...)
  Consider the way RT manipulated a leaked telephone
  call involving former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia
  Tymoshenko. Through selective editing, the network
  made it appear that Tymoshenko advocated violence
  against Russia. Or the constant reference
  to any Ukrainian opposed to a Russian takeover of the country as
  a terrorist. Or the unquestioning
  repetition of the ludicrous assertion last week that the United
  States has invested $5 billion in regime change in
  Ukraine.These are not facts, and they
  are not opinions. They are false claims, and when
  propaganda poses as news it creates real dangers and gives a
  green light to violence.”



  How many FACTS does Mr. Stengel attempt to deny? Let us count:



  - Yulia Tymoshenko herself has confirmed
  the authenticity of the conversation that included the following
  statements: “This is really beyond all boundaries. It's about
  time we grab our guns and kill those damned Russians together
  with their leader.” And “I would have found a way to kill those
  a***es. I hope I will be able to get all my connections involved.
  And I will use all of my means to make the entire world rise up,
  so that there wouldn't be even a scorched field left in Russia.”
  While there was indeed some controversy about a small portion of
  the recording being altered, Ms. Tymoshenko herself pointed to
  the source of the tape, not RT, as the guilty party, and the
  statements quoted above were not in question. Bottom line: if it
  appears that Ms. Tymoshenko is advocating violence against Russia
  and Russians – it’s because she blatantly is.



  - Forgetting for a second the absolutely ludicrous supposition,
  even in theory, of a Russian “takeover” of Ukraine, RT refers
  those supportive of the current authorities in Kiev as “anti-autonomy,”
  “pro-unity protesters” and “pro-Kiev
  activists.” But you know who is keen on throwing around the
  “terrorist” moniker? Why, that would be the newly-minted,
  US-supported Ukrainian government, applying the term to its own
  people (source: BBC News), as it sends tanks against the

  Yanukovich, for all his faults, refused to do.



  - Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was the one to
  publicize the $5
  billion “investment” in Ukraine’s “European future,” framing it
  in terms of the United States’ support of Ukraine achieving
  preconditions for “its European aspirations.” Interestingly
  enough, that “European future” and those “European aspirations”
  by definition blatantly ignored and/or rejected the aspirations
  of the 37 percent of Ukrainians who desired closer relationship
  with Russia via a trade union, as opposed to the 39 percent in
  favor of 
  joining the EU (source: Kiev International Institute of
  Sociology). How much of that $5 billion went to support the
  institutions that aided their interests
  and how much support did Ms. Nuland et al. lend to the
  democratically-elected president who
  represented them? Right. Not that anyone is particularly
  surprised. Wouldn't be the 
  first time that the US benignly “invested”
  in “democracy” (sources: Washington Post).



  Now, how does throwing Molotov
  cocktails (source: Sky News), savagely beating
  officers, and refusing
  medical aid to the injured while taking over government
  buildings fit into your definition of “peaceful protesters”?
  There was indeed brutality on both sides of the barricades (which
  RT thoroughly documented and
  aired), but you have admit – police officers don’t die by the
  hand of peaceful demonstrators.



  How is RT behind the “protesters hired snipers” assertions if
  those concerns were brought to light by the famous leaked (and
  confirmed 
  authentic – source: CNN) Ashton-Paet
  call, by quoting a Maidan medic whose credibility they went
  to pains to establish? The statement that “there is now stronger
  and stronger understanding that behind the snipers, it was not
  Yanukovich, but it was somebody from the new coalition” came not
  from RT but the Estonian minister.



  And why is the far-right, neo-Nazi threat
  in Ukraine being so flippantly dismissed despite being 
  documented by dozens of Western mainstream media 
  outlets (sources: BBC Newsnight, The Nation, Channel 4 UK)?



  The reason you’re seeing citations of sources right here, in the
  text, is so that it cannot be labeled as another “propaganda”
  piece full of RT’s own “false” reporting. Or does Mr. Stengel
  consider all media organizations that report inconvenient facts
  that challenge his reality to be propaganda outlets? It is very
  disappointing that a person of his position knows so very little
  of the reality of the situation in Ukraine, but it certainly
  explains a lot about the state of US foreign policy.



  Facts are facts, Mr. Stengel. It’s too bad you can’t get your own
  straight.","Who's really 'presenting lies as facts'? How State Dept. exposes itself to propaganda

Mr. Richard Stengel, the US Under Secretary of State who wrote such an impassioned “takedown” of RT in the US State Department blog, did get one thing right.


  Propaganda IS the deliberate dissemination of information that
  you know to be false or misguided.



  And boy, does Mr. Stengel make a valiant attempt at propagandizing,
  because anyone would be hard-pressed to cram more falsehoods into
  a hundred words:



  “From assertions that peaceful protesters hired snipers to
  repeated allegations that Kiev is beset by violence, fascism and
  anti-Semitism, these are lies falsely presented as news. (...)
  Consider the way RT manipulated a leaked telephone
  call involving former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia
  Tymoshenko. Through selective editing, the network
  made it appear that Tymoshenko advocated violence
  against Russia. Or the constant reference
  to any Ukrainian opposed to a Russian takeover of the country as
  a terrorist. Or the unquestioning
  repetition of the ludicrous assertion last week that the United
  States has invested $5 billion in regime change in
  Ukraine.These are not facts, and they
  are not opinions. They are false claims, and when
  propaganda poses as news it creates real dangers and gives a
  green light to violence.”



  How many FACTS does Mr. Stengel attempt to deny? Let us count:



  - Yulia Tymoshenko herself has confirmed
  the authenticity of the conversation that included the following
  statements: “This is really beyond all boundaries. It's about
  time we grab our guns and kill those damned Russians together
  with their leader.” And “I would have found a way to kill those
  a***es. I hope I will be able to get all my connections involved.
  And I will use all of my means to make the entire world rise up,
  so that there wouldn't be even a scorched field left in Russia.”
  While there was indeed some controversy about a small portion of
  the recording being altered, Ms. Tymoshenko herself pointed to
  the source of the tape, not RT, as the guilty party, and the
  statements quoted above were not in question. Bottom line: if it
  appears that Ms. Tymoshenko is advocating violence against Russia
  and Russians – it’s because she blatantly is.



  - Forgetting for a second the absolutely ludicrous supposition,
  even in theory, of a Russian “takeover” of Ukraine, RT refers
  those supportive of the current authorities in Kiev as “anti-autonomy,”
  “pro-unity protesters” and “pro-Kiev
  activists.” But you know who is keen on throwing around the
  “terrorist” moniker? Why, that would be the newly-minted,
  US-supported Ukrainian government, applying the term to its own
  people (source: BBC News), as it sends tanks against the
  anti-government protesters – something that even President
  Yanukovich, for all his faults, refused to do.

In a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday, April 26, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an end to the army operation against protesters in southeastern Ukraine and for stopping aggressive actions of ultranationalists from the Right Sector.

Lavrov also urged Kerry to use his influence for getting arrested protest leaders released.

“He [Lavrov] once again highlighted the issue of political prisoners and urged the United States to use its influence in order to get detained protest leaders in the South-East of Ukraine released. The secretary’s attention was drawn to the proposals put forth by the Party of Regions and public movements in the South-East regarding the start of a nationwide dialogue and constitutional reform,” the Foreign Ministry said.

Kerry assured Lavrov that Washington would seek to use its possibilities to prod the Kiev authorities into taking concrete steps to ease tensions and expressed hope that south-eastern regions would reciprocate.

Lavrov and Kerry also discussed the steps being taken to settle the incident with the detention of European military observers who have arrived in Ukraine at Kiev’s invitation under the Vienna Document of 2011 on confidence- and security-building measures. They travelled to the South-East without properly notifying the public bodies that are controlling the situation in the region.

On Friday, April 25, supporters of federalisation detained a bus with passengers, with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities.

The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures.

Yevgeny Gorbik, a spokesperson for the supporters of federalisation, told reporters that the detained military observers had been engaged in intelligence activities.

“The humanitarian group of the [OSCE] mission has denied any relation to them… They [observers] had intelligence agents, cryptograms, and notebooks with secret notes”, Gorbik said. “A Bulgarian officer had a notebook with notes in Russian which confirm his intelligence activities and speak of a meeting with agents,” he added.

“No charges have been brought against them so far.

The end of defense industry cooperation between Kiev and Moscow due to the political crisis in Ukraine would lead the latter to a catastrophe, while Russia would be able to replace what it imports, President Putin has said.

“Financially and technically Russia is able to conduct import
  substitution,” Putin has said, adding that it won't require
  substantial funding. And this “would not require a revision
  of the state defense order.”


  He estimated the whole process of import substitution for Russia
  would take between 1.5 and 2.5 years, depending on the type of
  the products.


“But for the Ukrainian defense industry, the severing of ties
  with Russian partners is likely to lead to disaster,” Putin
  said, speaking to the members of the Council of Lawmakers.
  “Why? They don’t have any other markets. They just don’t
  exist. The only consumer is the Russian Armed Forces.”


  However, he expressed hope that “rupture of these cooperation
  relations” will not happen.



  Still, Putin said he believes that such a halt to supplies is not
  a decision made “directly by enterprises.”

They [managers of these enterprises] understand perfectly in
  which situation Ukrainian government puts them. I’m sure, they
  would like to continue this cooperation,” he said.



  Earlier, Ukrainian First Vice-President Vitaly Yarema stated that
  the coup-appointed Ukrainian government had agreed to halt
  exports of weapons and military equipment to Russia. At the same
  time, he confirmed that deliveries of double-purpose (military
  and civil) products still continue.



  Speaking of sanctions that the West is considering imposing on
  Russian industry sectors, and particularly the country’s military
  industrial complex, Putin stated that the measure, if taken,
  could be an attempt to prevent Russia from defense import
  substitution.



  But, he said, “This is an attempt with a bad means.”

“We will do that anyway,” Putin emphasized.



  Putin said that he has already ordered Russia’s government to
  examine the question of import substitution of the
  military-industrial complex’s products coming from Ukraine.


“In any case, we are working on this now, I gave such an
  order to the government of the Russian Federation and they are
  actively working on it. [We are] studying all the issues related
  to import substitution,” he said.



  Russia will welcome specialists in the military-industrial
  complex from Ukraine, Putin said, vowing financial support to
  provide them with all necessities.


“They will receive a worthy salary, and accommodation. [The
  regions] will receive all necessary means from the federal
  budget, Putin said.","End of defense imports to Russia would be catastrophe for Ukraine – Putin

The combination of the polices of the government in Kiev and Washington blaming Russia for events is pushing the situation in Ukraine to a critical mass which threaten peace in Europe Willie Wimmer, former Vice President of the OSCE, tells RT.

RT:As it stands at the moment, America
  seems to think the more Russia is punished here, the more sorted
  the situation will be, do you agree with that?

Willie Wimmer: I think the situation is totally
  complicated and everything we know perhaps goes back to the Cuban
  crisis some decades ago.


RT:In that the Cold War continues?

WW: I think it’s even more complicated. It’s not
  only a Cold War it can be outstanding and dangerous and when we
  go back to the Cuban crisis, we know that big powers usually draw
  a red line and for the Americans it had been 90 km away from
  Miami there shouldn’t be a Soviet nuclear arsenal. And here in
  the Ukraine, it’s again similar. The Russian Federation draws a
  red line and they are not interested in having a country direct
  in their neighborhood who might change itself into a living
  danger, like a land mine, like a nuclear arsenal, which is
  located next to my own border. And therefore I think we face a
  critical situation in the next few weeks, perhaps even the next
  days and we only can hope that somebody might intervene in a
  sympathetic way and not create war in Europe.


RT:What’s the attitude in your country, in
  Germany, I mean your closer to the border than America certainly
  is. What do most Germans think about this these days?

WW: I think most Germans, they have really
  problems when they look at the actual situation and there is a
  lot of fear ongoing. This fear might be in a critical situation
  when it comes to the visit of our chancellor to Washington in the
  next week or so and many people think that Angela Merkel might
  arrive in Washington and we still have peace and when she will
  come back to Berlin there might be a different situation, perhaps
  even war. And therefore there’s an ongoing fear in Germany
  because of the situation and they don’t blame Russia for this
  situation, they look on Washington.


RT:And it’s Washington that’s pushing
  Europe here then yeah, as you see it?

WW: It’s not only Washington pushing the
  Europeans, its Washington which organized the events which are
  going on in the Ukraine, and we can go back to remarks being made
  by Mrs. Nuland that they invested more than 6 billion dollars to
  create such a critical mass, which led in the end to the Maidan
  development and therefore they want a return of investment.


RT:You’re a much respected diplomat,
  politician over the years, how do you think this is going to play
  out over the next month or so?

WW: I hope that we have some negotiations for an
  agreement and when we back to the Cuban crisis it was a direct
  link between President Kennedy and Secretary General Khrushchev
  who made it possible to find a solution and therefore I think
  it’s not a question of negotiations, there has to be direct
  contact between Obama and Putin, otherwise we face more than a
  critical situation.


RT:How much of a role does the local
  interim Ukrainian government have here then, it’s kind of out of
  their hands, in Washington’s hands, because we’ve got them
  calling the people in the east here a mob?

WW: I think the junta, as far as I see it in
  Kiev, is playing a dangerous card. They are acting against their
  own population as if they would be enemies, you can’t keep tanks
  and artillery and planes going against your own people, as long
  as they have occupied houses or have barricades. Usually in these
  circumstances this is a question for the police and not for the
  military. And therefore I think the junta In Kiev is like trigger
  for a mine, and this mine will explode sooner or later.

Germany will not be inviting whistleblower Edward Snowden to testify in front of a parliamentary committee which investigates US spying tactics of EU leaders and nationals, a German MP said on Thursday.


  A member of the investigative committee from Chancellor Angela
  Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) said in a
  statement that the government opposes Snowden testifying in the
  case regarding the National Security Agency (NSA)'s activities in
  Germany.


The federal government has never been in any doubt that
  there is no legal basis for Mr. Snowden to travel to
  Germany, Roderich Kiesewetter of the CDU said in a
  statement, as quoted by The Wall Street Journal.



  His statement came in response to a media report that accused the
  government of blocking Snowden’s visit to Germany because of
  diplomatic reasons.



  The report published earlier on Thursday by S?ddeutsche Zeitung
  said that a personal invitation to the former NSA contractor and
  leaker would run counter to the political interests of the
  Federal Republic and put a grave and permanent
  strain on US-German relations.



  German opposition members from the Left and Green party who are
  involved in the investigation believe that Snowden is a key
  witness and should testify in person. But the CDU believes a
  written questionnaire would suffice.



  The whistleblower is currenty in Russia under temporary asylum.
  He asked for asylum in Germany last summer, but his application
  was rejected because he didn't file it from German soil. If
  Snowden would have been invited to testify, he could have met the
  requirements.



  Meanwhile, opposition members have slammed Merkel for being
  cowardly towards the US.


Merkel is displaying cowardice towards our ally
  America, said Green party leader Simone Peter, as quoted by
  the Guardian. We owe the Americans nothing in this respect.
  The government must at least make a serious effort to safely
  bring Snowden to Germany and let him give evidence here. But
  Merkel doesn't want that.


  Merkel’s office said on Tuesday that the chancellor will raise
  the NSA surveillance issue during her upcoming visit to the US.
  She will meet with President Barack Obama on Friday.



  Clemense Binninger, chair of the investigative committee,
  believes that getting at least some response from the Americans
  would be “an important step forward to restoring trust,”
  Deutsche Welle reported in April.



  Snowden's revelations regarding US spying on Germany continue to
  pour in. Der Spiegel recently published additional leaked data,
  including information that the NSA compiled a comprehensive
  dossier on Merkel, which included over 300 intelligence reports.","Germany drops Snowden’s invite to testify on NSA spying in person

Russia has begun extensive military exercises near the Ukrainian border following the escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine.

“The order to use force against civilians has already been
  given, and if this military machine is not stopped, the amount of
  casualties will only grow,” Russian Defense Minister Sergey
  Shoigu said during an official meeting in Moscow.


“War games by NATO in Poland and the Baltic states are also
  not helping the normalization of the situation. We are forced to
  react to the situation.”


  Shoigu said that the drills involve march and deployment
  maneuvers by forces in the southern and western military
  districts, and separate Air Force exercises.



  Shoigu said that 11,000 Ukrainian soldiers, 160 tanks, 230
  armored carriers and at least 150 artillery pieces are involved
  in the operation against anti-Kiev activists.


“National guard units and Right Sector extremists are
  fighting against the peaceful population, as well as a volunteer
  Donbass ‘anti-terrorist’ unit. Also security and internal forces
  transferred to Lugansk and Donetsk from other areas of the
  country are suppressing dissent,” he said.



  Shoigu added that Ukrainian sabotage units had been deployed near
  the Russian border.



  In contrast, he said that the pro-Russian self-defense units
  number about 2,000 and have about 100 guns between them, which
  have mostly been taken from local police stations.


It's not an evenly matched confrontation, Shoigu said.



  The coup-imposed Ukrainian acting president, Aleksandr Turchinov,
  has demanded that Russia pull back its troops back from the
  Ukrainian border, calling the ongoing Russian military
  exercises“blackmail.”


  In a brief address, Turchinov claimed that “terrorists have
  crossed the border… taking hostages and killing the patriots of
  Ukraine.” He also called for the Russian government “to
  stop interfering into the internal affairs of our country.”


  The heaviest fighting on Thursday took place in Slavyansk,
  with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry reporting the deaths of at
  least five terrorists.



  NATO has estimated that Russia has massed at least 40,000 troops
  near its border with Ukraine. Moscow has not denied that it has
  moved troops to the region, but said that its internal troop
  movements are its own prerogative.



  NATO began military exercises in Poland on Wednesday, with more
  scheduled to take place in the Baltic states next week. So far,
  150 US paratroopers have arrived in the country from their
  stationary base in Italy, with 450 more set to join them.



  Poland’s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, has also asked NATO
  to deploy 10,000 troops in his country.

  enter the Black Sea on a rotating deployment. NATO has dispatched

EU leaders consider the takeover as illegal and have asked the EU executive arm, the European Commission, to propose economic, trade and financial restrictions on Crimea for rapid implementation.

These proposals are separate from an EU discussion on stepped-up sanctions against Russia if Moscow does not help deescalate tensions in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and the government in Kiev.

The document spelt out some of the practical difficulties involved in implementing sanctions specifically against Crimea, now that it is de facto a part of Russia.

Solutions need to be found that at the same time support the territorial integrity of Ukraine, do not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea, defend European interests in this region and do not penalize the Crimean people, the Commission said in a document prepared for EU governments to consider.

One way to discourage or penalize financial institutions in Crimea that cooperated with the annexation could be to restrict capital movements between the EU and those banks, it said, and bar EU citizens or businesses from carrying out transactions with them.

The same could hold for prohibiting investments by Crimean investors (companies located or registered in Crimea) into the EU and by EU investors into Crimean entities, it said.

The Commission proposals are still under review and a decision whether to follow them is likely to be taken by EU foreign ministers, whose next meeting is on May 12.

Out of Crimea's 1,000 bank branches, around 60 were owned by EU banks, the Commission said. Italy's Unicredit had 20, Austria's Raiffeisen had 32 and Hungarian OTP had six, the Commission said.

However, Raiffeisen closed its operations in Crimea in early April, it said, and Unicredit wants to transfer its Crimea branches to its Russian subsidiary.

Russian banks are gradually taking over in Crimea, but the main Russian banks (Sberbank and VTB ) reportedly are reluctant to do so for fear of becoming subject to European or U.S. sanctions, the Commission document said.

NO PREFERENTIAL TRADE TERMS

The Commission noted that by the end of April Ukrainian exporters will be in a position to trade under two preferential arrangements with the EU and enjoy significant tariff reductions.

But the exporters need to have a certificate of origin for their goods and Ukraine will stop issuing such certificates to companies based in Crimea.

However, the Commission document noted that there was practically no way to prevent Crimean products from being exported to the EU via Russia, unless they were clearly of Crimean origin, like wine.

The only way to guarantee an absolute ban on imports from Crimea would be to suspend trade with Russia entirely, the document said - an option which it made clear was not feasible.

In addition to the political consequences this would have, such a ban would also involve legal risks as it would require justification under World Trade Organisation law. A more practical option would consist in limiting the ban on import only to the products of clear Crimean origin such as wines.

Crimea has taken ownership of Ukraine's state companies on its territory, including the region's Black Sea natural gas fields. Black Sea gas production is currently only one billion cubic meters per year, but Ukraine had hoped it would increase to 3 billion cubic meters in 2015 and it had attracted foreign investors, including majors Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell.

The paper said Crimea residents would have to apply for visas to the EU through Kiev, because allowing them to apply via an EU consulate in Moscow would amount to indirect recognition of the illegal annexation.

The Commission also proposed that EU countries should not recognize passports issued by Russia to Crimea residents after the annexation.

Anti-government protesters have seized administrative buildings, including the City Hall and prosecutor’s office in yet another city in Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine. Protesters announced an indefinite rally and are erecting barricades.


  On Monday morning, a group of armed men wearing camouflage were
  reported to have taken control of a police office in the city of

  the police office is working as usual.


“Today at 06:00 am, a group of 30 unidentified armed people
  drove up in vans to the Konstantinovka police department and
  walked into the building. No weapons were used, there are no
  casualties,” police said in a statement.



  After that the men reportedly moved towards the building that
  hosts the City Hall and prosecutor's office, which they also took
  control of and hoisted the flag of the Donetsk People’s Republic.



  According to law enforcement, the people who took control of the
  buildings have held talks with the police.



  Local media reported that protesters made no demands but called
  their actions “preparations for the referendum” that
  locals hope will take place on May 11.



  In the meantime, anti-Kiev activists also gathered outside the
  City Hall. According to RT’s Paula Slier working at the scene,
  the mood there was “jovial despite armed guns at the
  entrance” and the crowd was clapping welcoming the move.



  Some of the protesters with St. George ribbons drove trucks with
  concrete blocks and a construction crane to the administrative
  building, preparing to fortify barricades.



  Prior to that anti-government protesters blocked the entrance
  with sand bags and tires.

A Russian and a Belorussian national, both employees of the Russian NTV channel have been detained in the city Pershotravensk in Dnipropetrovsk region, SBU announced. Earlier it was reported that both journalists vanished.


  The men were detained by Ukraine's Dnepr unit on Wednesday when
  they were filming administrative buildings on hidden cameras. The
  men are being investigated under article that forbids the use of
  special technical means of obtaining information.


  One of the men showed passport of Belarus and presented himself
  to be a journalists for Russian NTV channel, yet he failed to
  provide any press credentials. The second detainee is a Russian
  citizen who lives in the Lugansk region of Ukraine, Ukrainian
  Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said.



  Earlier, RT managed to get a hold of the NTV program host who
  said that a Belarusian citizen Stepan Chirich, a producer for the
  weekly program Central Television, went to the city of
  Pershotravinsk in the Dnepropetrovsk region to make a report
  about the visit of a well-known exorcist, Pastor Bob Larson,
  who’s there as part of his world tour.



  “We lost contact with [Chirich] on Tuesday
  evening,” Vadim Takmenyov, the program’s host, told RT.



  Chirich has been working for the program for several years.



  “We sent him to Ukraine – a producer, not a correspondent
  – because he is the only Central Television employee who has a
  Belarusian passport, using which one can cross the
  [Russian-Ukrainian] border without any problems and do his
  professional activities,” Takmenyov said.



  Takmenyov underlined that political events in the crisis-torn
  country were completely unrelated to that particular trip.



  A cameraman who was working with the NTV producer was from
  Lugansk, in eastern Ukraine, who too went missing.



  Earlier, the channel said that the disappearance and subsequent
  detention of the crew might be connected with reports about the
  detention of two suspected Russian “saboteurs”
  in Dnepropetrovsk region.



  According to Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, two men
  “pretending to be journalists” were grabbed by
  local militia and passed over to the Ukrainian Security Service
  (SBU) after filming a police station and the city council in
  Pershotravinsk.



  Citing unofficial sources, the paper said the unnamed men had
  Belarusian passports, but equipment they used “indicated
  their relation to Russian intelligence.”


  He said the channel sent to its colleagues in Ukraine documents
  proving that Chirich has nothing to do with any intelligence
  services.



  “We hope [journalists in Ukraine] will report on [the

Putin said the work done at Tuesday’s meeting of the Eurasian Economic Council in Minsk on April 29 was productive. “We removed all obstacles to the signing of the treaty, albeit not without difficulty. We found compromises and only some technical issues remain to be worked out. I hope this will be done in the very near future,” Putin said at a meeting with government members on Wednesday, April 30.

He noted that some of the reference rules had not been agreed and admitted that “this cannot be done in such a short time”. At the same time, the participants in the meeting agreed issues concerning energy and infrastructure.

The work on the Eurasian Economic Union, which is expected to become operational within the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia from January 1, 2015, was discussed in Minsk on April 29 by Putin, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.

The supranational body, the European Economic Commission, will continue to operate from Moscow. The single financial regulator of the Eurasian Economic Union will be set up in Astana, capital of Kazakhstan, by 2025.

Common markets of oil, petroleum products and gas of the three countries will also start operating no later than 2025, and a common electricity market slightly earlier.

The question of duties on petroleum products will be subject to bilateral regulation pending the creation of a common market.

The Eurasian Economic Commission is a supranational body of the Common Economic Space (prototype of the Eurasian Economic Union) created by Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The Common Economic Space has been operating since the start of 2012.

The Commission coordinates integration processes within the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia and the Common Economic Space.

The institutional part of the agreement should determine the legal status and organisational framework of the union, and lay down the main principles of its work.

Putin stressed the need to guarantee “four freedoms”: free movement of goods, services, capital and labour among the member states. “It is important to set forth concrete obligations to eliminate exclusions and limitations remaining in the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space,” Putin said.

He believes that the European Economic Union needs to be granted broad powers in the field of economic regulation. “This will allow (us) to carry out a common and coordinated policy in key industries, raise the sustainability and development potential of the national economies, create a large common market and bring in additional investments,” the head of state said.

Putin noted that integration was already paying off. “Despite the overall economic slowdown in the world, trade turnover between the three countries in 2013 did not decrease but on the contrary grew to 64.1 billion US dollars,” he said.

The structure of mutual trade improved: the share of resources decreased while the share of goods with a high added value increased. Putin recalled that entrepreneurs were actively engaged in this work and co-authored many decisions.","“I would like to ask you together with partners from Belarus and Kazakhstan to finalise it (a draft treaty) as quickly as possible,” the president said at a meeting with members of the government on Wednesday.

Putin stressed the need to guarantee “four freedoms”: free movement of goods, services, capital and labour among the member states. “It is important to set forth concrete obligations to eliminate exclusions and limitations remaining in the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space,” Putin said.

He believes that the European Economic Union needs to be granted broad powers in the field of economic regulation. “This will allow (us) to carry out a common and coordinated policy in key industries, raise the sustainability and development potential of the national economies, create a large common market and bring in additional investments,” the head of state said.

Putin noted that integration was already paying off. “Despite the overall economic slowdown in the world, trade turnover between the three countries in 2013 did not decrease but on the contrary grew to 64.1 billion US dollars,” he said.

The structure of mutual trade improved: the share of resources decreased while the share of goods with a high added value increased. Putin recalled that entrepreneurs were actively engaged in this work and co-authored many decisions.",603

Sometimes size DOES matter. China may pass the US and become the world’s most important economy this year, according to the World Bank. It would take the position the US has held since 1872.


  Previous studies have suggested China could become the world's
  biggest economy by 2019.



  Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, the Chinese economy has
  contributed a quarter of total global growth. Between 2011-2014,
  China’s economy will account for 24 percent, according to IMF
  estimates.



  In comparison the US economy will only show an increase of 7.6
  percent over the same period.



  The predictions are hard to calculate as the latest estimates are
  based on purchasing power parity. The index attempts to assess
  the size of an economy based on the assumption that prices of
  non-tradable goods and services are a lot lower in poorer
  countries, says the Financial Times (FT).



  The evaluation process of the service may differ, as a haircut in
  China may cost much less than in the US, however its quality may
  differ as well.



  The same problem touches upon the quality of tangible goods. A
  DVD player bought in China may be way cheaper than a US one,
  however there is no warranty that it will last longer than
  several months. Besides US goods are sold with far more consumer
  protection laws, which through more scrutiny and inspection,
  delivers a better product.



  Another barrier in measuring the true size of the economy is the
  availability of trusty data, as China is controlled by a
  secretive authoritarian government that sometimes manipulates
  data for political purposes.



  It has a huge amount of illegal and unaccounted for ‘shadow’
  income sourced from corruption, a sex industry, numerous illegal
  street vendors, and other services sectors that are not counted
  in official statistics. Therefore the ‘shadow’ economy could be
  more than 20 times bigger than official figures report.



  The Chinese economy may be 20 percent larger than official
  figures show, this it may have overtaken the US several years
  ago, says the FT.



  Meanwhile the living standards of the average Chinese citizen are
  still far lower than those in many developing countries.



  According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s economy
  ranked 93 in per capita purchasing power parity terms. That was
  just ahead of Turkmenistan and Albania but well behind Libya,
  Azerbaijan and Surinam.



  That means that on average China’s 1.36 billion people are
  unlikely to catch up with Western living standards for many
  decades to come.","No longer #1? China may replace US as biggest economy this year – World Bank

At the end of April, President Barack Obama swept through Asia like a storm, leaving behind him all sorts of political debris, as well as confusion, and often even deep embarrassment.


  There were speeches clearly aimed at swelling anti-Chinese and
  anti-North Korean sentiments, and there were promises to ‘defend’
  certain countries, including South Korea and Japan, although both
  of them appear to be more belligerent than their communist
  alleged adversaries.



  There was immediate reaction from Pyongyang, calling South Korean
  President Park Geun-Hye a “prostitute,” and there was an ice-cold
  reaction from Beijing, calling on the US and Japan to “abandon
  their cold war mentality.”



  The US language was, as always, patronizing, even insulting – as
  in The New York Times’ report:


“Jeffrey A. Bader, who was the senior China adviser on the
  National Security Council until 2011, said: 'The message is:
  Don’t think that what Putin is doing in eastern Ukraine is so
  brilliant that you should be inspired by it. Don’t think that
  this is a model that could work for you.'”


  This kind of unsavory preaching is naturally despised in China
  and in many other countries.



  But Obama’s visit was disastrous on many other fronts, too. There
  were trade deals proposed that never fully materialized,
  including those between the United States and Japan. There were
  bilateral trade agreements signed between the US and Malaysia,
  but the 12-country Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which commits
  countries to lower import tariffs and therefore horrifies local
  producers, never really materialized.



  What actually occurred was the signing of what Reutersdescribed
  as “a 10-year military pact with the Philippines that opens
  the way for US troops, planes and warships to have greater access
  to bases in the Philippines.”



  Officially, it was to ‘protect’ the Philippines from the rising
  ‘threat’ of China. Although many of the intellectuals in Manila
  see the United States as pitching southeast nations against its
  great neighbor.



  Eduardo C. Tadem, a leading Philippine academic and professor of
  Asian studies at the University of the Philippines, commented for
  this report:


The Obama administration has not departed substantially from
  the policies of its predecessors as far as foreign policy is
  concerned. Given this, it does not possess the moral authority to
  lecture China on the proper behavior of a big power in the
  Asia-Pacific region. Granted that China has not been on its best
  behavior with respect to the territorial disputes it is embroiled
  with in the region, it is the US, on the whole, that has done
  much more damage against Asian peoples and societies with its
  imperial policies in both the economic and political spheres.
  Neither does it have the moral authority to lead Asian societies
  in charting a new economic order given its own failed economy
  with high unemployment and continually rising inequalities.


  Malaysia became a brand new addition to the list of US ‘allies’
  in the region, although, to what extent, still remains to be
  seen.



  As I landed at the habitually super-efficient Kuala Lumpur
  International Airport on April 26, long lines formed queues
  before the immigration counters, and arriving passengers were
  fingerprinted – something that is very rarely done in Malaysia.



  The rail network had collapsed, express trains were running on
  local tracks, and I was told that many of the roads in the
  capital had been blocked.



  Overall, in Malaysia, the entire ‘presidential charade’ was
  thoroughly embarrassing, even from the point of view of the
  former ruler of the country, and one of the most outspoken
  critics of the West on the Asian continent, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad.
  The former prime minister particularly distrusted the proposed
  TPP or TPPA. Malaysian filmmaker and TV producer Azreen Madzlan
  shared her experience with me:


“According to former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr
  Mahathir Mohamad during an interview with a local business
  channel Capital TV, for the show that I was producing, Malaysia
  should not be compelled to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership
  Agreement (TPPA) just because of President Obama’s visit to
  Malaysia this weekend. Tun M who has openly roasted Najib’s
  administration for its intention to sign on with the
  non-transparent deal continues to warn that TPPA is a controlled
  trade agreement put together by an impoverished nation trying to
  exploit the natural resources of other countries.”


  But the Malaysian media had chosen to welcome the supreme leader
  of the Western world with loud fanfares, even using the most
  poetic words.



  Huge headlines shouted from the top of most of the local dailies:
  'Hello Malaysia,' the self-proclaimed 'people's paper,' the
  Sunday Star, wrote as it depicted the grinning face of Barack
  Obama. The paper then commented: “Flashing his
  infectious smile, President Barack Obama stepped out of Air Force
  One, gave his customary right handed “hello” wave – and charmed
  every one of the dignitaries who met him as he arrived for his
  official visit to the country. It will be a busy day for him
  before he leaves for Manila tomorrow.”


  Western media opted for a wide range of attitudes, from hardcore
  propaganda to the phlegmatic style adopted by The New York Times:


“On Sunday, President Obama visited Malaysia to underscore
  how much has changed in the past 16 years – not least in the
  country’s attitude toward the United States, which has evolved
  from deep suspicion, verging on contempt, to a cautious desire
  for cooperation.”


  Legendary Malaysian political activist Hishamuddin Rais (he
  identifies himself as a ‘non-government individual’) wrote for
  this report:


“Obama is trying to recreate the atmosphere of the Cold War
  in Asia in particular and globally...Obama’s trip to Malaysia in
  particular is aimed at the Malaysian leadership to open up and
  allow access to the Malaysian market. At the same time America is
  keen to have a military arrangement with Malaysia, i.e. the
  possibility of having a base. This is a move partly to control
  the Southeast Asian market and also to contain what Americans
  term as the danger of China. Obama is trying to create a wedge
  between ASEAN nations and China. In Malaysia in particular, with
  the weak government of Najib Razak, Obama will force Najib to
  sign the TPPA trade agreement. It is a fact that TPPA will be
  destructive to the domestic market.”


  There was plenty of clich? propaganda talk from US officials
  about ‘defending democracy,' about freedom and trade, and about
  all those ‘terrible countries’ that the ‘benevolent and wise
  West’ has to ‘deal with.'



  The increasingly aggressive role of the United States and the
  'Western world’ has not been discussed in the suddenly
  over-polite local media outlets. It should have been. Because
  between the lines, it was clear that the goal of Obama’s journey
  was to flex muscles, and to show Asia who is still in charge
  here.



  And of course, to re-pledge support for the most obedient ones,
  like Japan and the Philippines, over their policy towards China,
  or in the case of Japan, its open hostility towards the great
  neighbor.



  It is essential that the Asian countries that are now willing to
  collaborate with the West are actually becoming co-responsible
  for what can be best described as the imperialist,
  neo-colonialist, even fascist, adventurism of North America and
  Europe.



  In the future, history may judge them very harshly!



  The West, including the United States, has embarked on all sorts
  of genocidal projects all over the Asia Pacific region for
  centuries. It has terrorized this part of the world with
  tremendous force and determination, from Vladivostok to East
  Timor.



  Be it not for the servility of Asian leaders, and for the total
  manipulation of history, Air Force One would have been met with
  jet fighters and interceptors – not with flowers and national
  anthems.



  The problem is that in the Asia Pacific region, in many parts of
  it at least, the countries are governed by thoroughly shameless
  ‘elites’ (read thugs, bandits), and these individuals are united
  with Western economic and political ‘leaders' in their
  determination to plunder and mug everything that grows, hides
  below the surface, and even walks and talks.



  This is especially true about the places like the Philippines and
  Indonesia, but also about Thailand, Cambodia, and even, to a
  lesser extent, South Korea.



  Japan is an exception, as it has willingly and shamelessly been
  exchanging its independence for a rich and comfortable quality of
  life, willingly accepting the role of an obedient, sclerotic, and
  depressed (but extremely well paid) servant of the West, on the
  Asian continent.



  David McNeill, a leading expert on Japan and a Professor at
  Sophia University, recently explained during our conversation and
  the filming of my Okinawa documentary, in Tokyo:


“Japan, after the Second World War, aligned itself very
  quickly with America… And Japan’s military alliance with America
  is also accompanied with, what critics would say, its subservient
  attitude towards Washington.”


  Let’s just revisit a few of the most horrifying atrocities the
  West performed in the Asia Pacific region, in the last hundred
  years or so.



  Both British and US forces occupied, brutally, the city of
  Vladivostok in Russia's Far East after the Bolshevik Revolution.



  China was plundered and colonized by European forces, brutally
  and relentlessly.



  Korea was terrorized by mainly North American troops, with the
  most horrific toll on the local, mainly civilian population, with
  an estimated death toll of over four million people.



  During WWII, Japan endured firebombing and the carpet-bombing of
  its cities, including Tokyo, as well as basically, two nuclear
  experiments against its population in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.



  The French barbarically tortured, raped, and mutilated the people
  of Vietnam, but also those of Laos and Cambodia. The savagery
  exceeded even that of the later US ‘involvement,' as many local
  people, whilst I lived in Hanoi for three years, explained to me.



  In 'Indochina,' the US, of course, bombed to ashes entire cities,
  poisoned the countryside, raped the female population of entire
  villages, and committed atrocities comparable only to those they
  themselves had earlier committed in Korea. Historians are still
  arguing about the death toll: Was it six million or ten million,
  during what they called the ‘Vietnam War’ and the ‘Secret War in
  Laos?' (In that part of the world, that genocide is squarely
  identified as the ‘American War’).



  The US also made sure to open the doors to the Khmer Rouge in
  Cambodia (by carpet-bombing most of the Cambodian countryside
  into the stone ages), later vocally demanding their return to
  power, from the floor of the United Nations and other
  organizations. All that, of course, happened after Vietnamese
  troops had kicked out Pol Pot’s boys and girls from power (the US
  considered it a great crime).



  Kissinger had it very clear: He suggested that “anything that
  flies should be used against anything that moves,” and he
  had it his way. And he never faced a firing squad for this,
  although his tactics were not too different from those employed
  by the German Nazis.



  In the Philippines, the US committed much greater atrocities than
  Japan (including the Balanginga massacre), but a brainwashing
  campaign, and the servility of most of the local media, made it
  impossible to discuss these topics openly.



  The Philippines were brutally colonized by both Spain and the
  United States, but the US propagandists have managed to
  re-narrate the entire history of the archipelago.



  British rule in what is now Malaysia and Singapore was very far
  from benevolent.



  The Thai Western ally murdered its communists, as well as student
  protesters, and placed its territory at the disposal of the West
  during the Vietnam War.



  Indonesia was repeatedly attacked by the United States from its
  bases in the Philippines, during the reign of the progressive and
  anti-Western President Sukarno.



  The US-sponsored military coup brought the military junta to
  power, and some two to three million Indonesians were murdered –
  mainly communists, Chinese citizens, and intellectuals. Fascist
  Indonesia then occupied (with the support of the West) tiny East
  Timor, where some 30 percent of the population lost their lives
  in a horrific genocide. Western media hushes up coverage of the
  ongoing genocide against the Papuan population, as it greatly
  benefits the interests of Western mining companies.



  Still, collaboration with the US appears to be an attractive
  option to many governments in the region.



  China is watching, and, not surprisingly, it appears that it does
  not like what it sees at all. Russia, another great ‘Asian’ power
  is even more outraged. North Korea is, as always, ‘ready.'



  Mr. Obama may count on the weak and submissive allies, but Asia
  is changing. It is evolving. It is watching. It may soon begin
  saying “No.”



  Mr. Obama decided to visit South Korea but not China.



  Does it matter? Maybe...but for how long?



  If you come or do not come, we will be here, said
  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang.

  countries to lower import tariffs and therefore horrifies local
  producers, never really materialized.



  What actually occurred was the signing of what Reutersdescribed
  as “a 10-year military pact with the Philippines that opens
  the way for US troops, planes and warships to have greater access
  to bases in the Philippines.”



  Officially, it was to ‘protect’ the Philippines from the rising
  ‘threat’ of China. Although many of the intellectuals in Manila
  see the United States as pitching southeast nations against its
  great neighbor.



  Eduardo C. Tadem, a leading Philippine academic and professor of
  Asian studies at the University of the Philippines, commented for
  this report:


The Obama administration has not departed substantially from
  the policies of its predecessors as far as foreign policy is
  concerned. Given this, it does not possess the moral authority to
  lecture China on the proper behavior of a big power in the
  Asia-Pacific region. Granted that China has not been on its best
  behavior with respect to the territorial disputes it is embroiled
  with in the region, it is the US, on the whole, that has done
  much more damage against Asian peoples and societies with its
  imperial policies in both the economic and political spheres.
  Neither does it have the moral authority to lead Asian societies
  in charting a new economic order given its own failed economy
  with high unemployment and continually rising inequalities.


  Malaysia became a brand new addition to the list of US ‘allies’
  in the region, although, to what extent, still remains to be
  seen.



  As I landed at the habitually super-efficient Kuala Lumpur
  International Airport on April 26, long lines formed queues
  before the immigration counters, and arriving passengers were
  fingerprinted – something that is very rarely done in Malaysia.



  The rail network had collapsed, express trains were running on
  local tracks, and I was told that many of the roads in the
  capital had been blocked.



  Overall, in Malaysia, the entire ‘presidential charade’ was
  thoroughly embarrassing, even from the point of view of the
  former ruler of the country, and one of the most outspoken
  critics of the West on the Asian continent, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad.
  The former prime minister particularly distrusted the proposed
  TPP or TPPA. Malaysian filmmaker and TV producer Azreen Madzlan
  shared her experience with me:


“According to former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr
  Mahathir Mohamad during an interview with a local business
  channel Capital TV, for the show that I was producing, Malaysia
  should not be compelled to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership
  Agreement (TPPA) just because of President Obama’s visit to
  Malaysia this weekend. Tun M who has openly roasted Najib’s
  administration for its intention to sign on with the
  non-transparent deal continues to warn that TPPA is a controlled
  trade agreement put together by an impoverished nation trying to
  exploit the natural resources of other countries.”


  But the Malaysian media had chosen to welcome the supreme leader
  of the Western world with loud fanfares, even using the most
  poetic words.



  Huge headlines shouted from the top of most of the local dailies:
  'Hello Malaysia,' the self-proclaimed 'people's paper,' the
  Sunday Star, wrote as it depicted the grinning face of Barack
  Obama. The paper then commented: “Flashing his
  infectious smile, President Barack Obama stepped out of Air Force
  One, gave his customary right handed “hello” wave – and charmed
  every one of the dignitaries who met him as he arrived for his
  official visit to the country. It will be a busy day for him
  before he leaves for Manila tomorrow.”


  Western media opted for a wide range of attitudes, from hardcore
  propaganda to the phlegmatic style adopted by The New York Times:


“On Sunday, President Obama visited Malaysia to underscore
  how much has changed in the past 16 years – not least in the
  country’s attitude toward the United States, which has evolved
  from deep suspicion, verging on contempt, to a cautious desire
  for cooperation.”


  Legendary Malaysian political activist Hishamuddin Rais (he
  identifies himself as a ‘non-government individual’) wrote for
  this report:


“Obama is trying to recreate the atmosphere of the Cold War
  in Asia in particular and globally...Obama’s trip to Malaysia in
  particular is aimed at the Malaysian leadership to open up and
  allow access to the Malaysian market. At the same time America is
  keen to have a military arrangement with Malaysia, i.e. the
  possibility of having a base. This is a move partly to control
  the Southeast Asian market and also to contain what Americans
  term as the danger of China. Obama is trying to create a wedge
  between ASEAN nations and China. In Malaysia in particular, with
  the weak government of Najib Razak, Obama will force Najib to
  sign the TPPA trade agreement. It is a fact that TPPA will be
  destructive to the domestic market.”


  There was plenty of clich? propaganda talk from US officials
  about ‘defending democracy,' about freedom and trade, and about
  all those ‘terrible countries’ that the ‘benevolent and wise
  West’ has to ‘deal with.'



  The increasingly aggressive role of the United States and the
  'Western world’ has not been discussed in the suddenly
  over-polite local media outlets. It should have been. Because
  between the lines, it was clear that the goal of Obama’s journey
  was to flex muscles, and to show Asia who is still in charge
  here.



  And of course, to re-pledge support for the most obedient ones,
  like Japan and the Philippines, over their policy towards China,
  or in the case of Japan, its open hostility towards the great
  neighbor.



  It is essential that the Asian countries that are now willing to
  collaborate with the West are actually becoming co-responsible
  for what can be best described as the imperialist,
  neo-colonialist, even fascist, adventurism of North America and
  Europe.



  In the future, history may judge them very harshly!



  The West, including the United States, has embarked on all sorts
  of genocidal projects all over the Asia Pacific region for
  centuries. It has terrorized this part of the world with
  tremendous force and determination, from Vladivostok to East
  Timor.



  Be it not for the servility of Asian leaders, and for the total
  manipulation of history, Air Force One would have been met with
  jet fighters and interceptors – not with flowers and national
  anthems.



  The problem is that in the Asia Pacific region, in many parts of
  it at least, the countries are governed by thoroughly shameless
  ‘elites’ (read thugs, bandits), and these individuals are united
  with Western economic and political ‘leaders' in their
  determination to plunder and mug everything that grows, hides
  below the surface, and even walks and talks.



  This is especially true about the places like the Philippines and
  Indonesia, but also about Thailand, Cambodia, and even, to a
  lesser extent, South Korea.



  Japan is an exception, as it has willingly and shamelessly been
  exchanging its independence for a rich and comfortable quality of
  life, willingly accepting the role of an obedient, sclerotic, and
  depressed (but extremely well paid) servant of the West, on the
  Asian continent.



  David McNeill, a leading expert on Japan and a Professor at
  Sophia University, recently explained during our conversation and
  the filming of my Okinawa documentary, in Tokyo:


“Japan, after the Second World War, aligned itself very
  quickly with America… And Japan’s military alliance with America
  is also accompanied with, what critics would say, its subservient
  attitude towards Washington.”


  Let’s just revisit a few of the most horrifying atrocities the
  West performed in the Asia Pacific region, in the last hundred
  years or so.



  Both British and US forces occupied, brutally, the city of
  Vladivostok in Russia's Far East after the Bolshevik Revolution.



  China was plundered and colonized by European forces, brutally
  and relentlessly.



  Korea was terrorized by mainly North American troops, with the
  most horrific toll on the local, mainly civilian population, with
  an estimated death toll of over four million people.



  During WWII, Japan endured firebombing and the carpet-bombing of
  its cities, including Tokyo, as well as basically, two nuclear
  experiments against its population in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.



  The French barbarically tortured, raped, and mutilated the people
  of Vietnam, but also those of Laos and Cambodia. The savagery
  exceeded even that of the later US ‘involvement,' as many local
  people, whilst I lived in Hanoi for three years, explained to me.



  In 'Indochina,' the US, of course, bombed to ashes entire cities,
  poisoned the countryside, raped the female population of entire
  villages, and committed atrocities comparable only to those they
  themselves had earlier committed in Korea. Historians are still
  arguing about the death toll: Was it six million or ten million,
  during what they called the ‘Vietnam War’ and the ‘Secret War in
  Laos?' (In that part of the world, that genocide is squarely
  identified as the ‘American War’).



  The US also made sure to open the doors to the Khmer Rouge in
  Cambodia (by carpet-bombing most of the Cambodian countryside
  into the stone ages), later vocally demanding their return to
  power, from the floor of the United Nations and other
  organizations. All that, of course, happened after Vietnamese
  troops had kicked out Pol Pot’s boys and girls from power (the US
  considered it a great crime).



  Kissinger had it very clear: He suggested that “anything that
  flies should be used against anything that moves,” and he
  had it his way. And he never faced a firing squad for this,
  although his tactics were not too different from those employed
  by the German Nazis.



  In the Philippines, the US committed much greater atrocities than
  Japan (including the Balanginga massacre), but a brainwashing
  campaign, and the servility of most of the local media, made it
  impossible to discuss these topics openly.



  The Philippines were brutally colonized by both Spain and the
  United States, but the US propagandists have managed to
  re-narrate the entire history of the archipelago.



  British rule in what is now Malaysia and Singapore was very far
  from benevolent.



  The Thai Western ally murdered its communists, as well as student
  protesters, and placed its territory at the disposal of the West
  during the Vietnam War.



  Indonesia was repeatedly attacked by the United States from its
  bases in the Philippines, during the reign of the progressive and
  anti-Western President Sukarno.



  The US-sponsored military coup brought the military junta to
  power, and some two to three million Indonesians were murdered –
  mainly communists, Chinese citizens, and intellectuals. Fascist
  Indonesia then occupied (with the support of the West) tiny East
  Timor, where some 30 percent of the population lost their lives
  in a horrific genocide. Western media hushes up coverage of the
  ongoing genocide against the Papuan population, as it greatly
  benefits the interests of Western mining companies.



  Still, collaboration with the US appears to be an attractive
  option to many governments in the region.



  China is watching, and, not surprisingly, it appears that it does
  not like what it sees at all. Russia, another great ‘Asian’ power
  is even more outraged. North Korea is, as always, ‘ready.'



  Mr. Obama may count on the weak and submissive allies, but Asia
  is changing. It is evolving. It is watching. It may soon begin
  saying “No.”



  Mr. Obama decided to visit South Korea but not China.



  Does it matter? Maybe...but for how long?



  If you come or do not come, we will be here, said
  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang.

An action of pro-Nazi Ukrainian nationalists dedicated to a yet another anniversary since the setting up of the Halichina Ukrainian division of the SS was held in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov Sunday, local news media said.

Several hundred radicals gathered near the monument to the most odious figure in the history of Ukrainian nationalism, Stepan Bandera. The organizers said about 3,000 people might take part all in all.

Earlier on the same day, former deputies of the Lvov town hall, who had seats there “in the first democratically elected” convocation in the early 1990’s, issued a highly untypical statement voicing protest against the street march of the neo-Nazis, which they said might inflict damage on the country’s national unity.

‘Anger’, ‘disenchantment’ and  ‘pride’ are three words that perfectly sum up the mood in southeastern Ukraine at the moment. However, there is one thing the majority of citizens in this region crave more than anything – a referendum on their future.


  RT’s documentary channel shows footage never seen on television
  looking at the reaction of residents living in eastern Ukraine,
  to see how they have been affected since the coup-appointed
  government took power in Kiev.



  Watch RT's documentary South-East Ukraine: Crisis diary

“We are not separatists, we are not radicals. I live in
  Kharkov and I am 61 and want to understand what country I live
  in,” said one local resident.


“When are they going to stop calling us separatists? We get
  up each morning and start greeting each other, ‘hello I’m a
  separatist’, ‘hello, I’m a terrorist,’” said a women living
  in Lugansk.



  Residents in the east of the country are ready for the long haul.
  They have local support and have begun to fortify positions
  around cities and towns, in preparation for expected attacks from
  forces loyal to Kiev. However, many hope it won’t come to this.


“We are all Slavs. We have to live in peace. We are brothers
  and we should not fight each other. Our home is Russia,”
  said a group of men aged around 50. “How is it possible to
  listen to that so-called government from Kiev who gave orders
  today to kill their own people in Slavyansk,” they
  continued.



  Slavyansk has been the stronghold of the anti-Kiev uprising. Just
  a few months ago, it was just another town in the Donetsk region,
  which is the industrial heartland of the country. However, since
  the coup-installed government came to power and ousted President
  Viktor Yanokovich, who was born just over 100 kilometers away in
  Enakievo, things have been very different in the city, with
  anti-government sentiment growing by the day.


“Both my grandfathers were killed in World War II. I will
  never sing ‘Glory to Ukraine’ or ‘Glory to Bandera’. I hope they
  get the message,” said a middle-aged man in Slavyansk.



  The vast majority of anti-Kiev protestors are unarmed. They carry
  baseball bats and wear military fatigues, but few have weapons
  and guns like the forces loyal to the coup-installed government.


“Dmitry Yarosh, who is the head of theRight Sectoris assembling a hit squad called
  ‘Donbass’. Once it is assembled, he is going to target us. We are
  just unarmed people who are trying to protect our legitimate
  interests,” said another local resident in Slavyansk.



  The documentary shows how difficult it has become for some
  Russian-speaking Ukrainians to live in their own country. People
  are stopped in the street and beaten or arrested just for wearing
  a St. George ribbon, to commemorate those who were killed in the
  Second World War. While groups of ultra nationalist and radical
  groups roam the streets spreading fueling and stoking tension.


“There is no difference between us, except we don’t speak
  Ukrainian. Why do they hate their own people so much? Where does
  all this bitterness and hatred come from?” a women, almost
  brought to tears, said.



  One man in his early 20’s, who was leading a Ukrainian
  nationalist rally stated, “We want the Europe that the
  crusaders fought for, the Europe that the European nationalists
  fought for, the Europe of white people. Muslims humiliate native
  people now and they take away our lands. We will stand for a
  white Europe, a traditional Europe!”


  It is difficult for local residents of southeastern Ukraine to
  understand that their own country is trying to attack them, just
  because they have different viewpoints. Contact with soldiers
  loyal to Kiev is common and some of the troops understand the
  pro-Russian Ukrainians’ predicament.



  However, it is not just in the south east of the country where
  displeasure has been voiced over the last few months about what
  has unfolded in Ukraine. One man speaking in the port city of
  Odessa said, “Around 80 percent of the people here are
  against Maidan. The rest are either misled or don’t live here
  permanently.”


  There is a sense of lawlessness in the country, with those in the
  south east feeling particularly vulnerable. Those living in
  cities like Dnepropetrovsk and Odessa feel they have no
  protection from the police against attacks by Ukrainian Right
  Sector radicals.



  A referendum and an exit from control by Kiev seems like the only
  viable option.","‘Why do they hate us so much?’ Southeast Ukraine seeks to understand new regime

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has invited Russia to hold talks in Vienna on April 28 under the Vienna Document of April 28 on confidence and security-building measures.

It said that in reply to Kiev’s inquiry Moscow had failed to provide exhaustive explanations regarding the purpose and place of military manoeuvres held in the Southern and Western Military Districts over the past several days near the Ukrainian border, the date of their completion and the number and type of military units involved.

“Given the insufficient information received, Ukraine has suggested to the Russian Federation that consultations be held in Vienna on April 28, as provided for in the abovementioned document, in order to discuss this issue. Other states that have voiced concern about Russia’s military activities near the Ukrainian border have also been invited to take part in the consultations,” the Foreign Ministry said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the Russia Today television channel this week that Russian troops were staying on their own territory and were not taking any steps that would go against their obligations.

“We have never denied the fact that we sent additional troops to the border [with Ukraine] just as the Ukrainian government redeployed its troops closer to our border. Our troops are conducting exercises on the territory of our own country. Such exercises are conducted regularly since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister,” Lavrov said.

Exercises are held in different parts of Russia. “As far as I know, the next exercises will be held in the north-west of the country. This is a continuous process. The army must be in good shape and ready to act while hoping that it will not have to interfere,” the minister said.

“However, if we are attacked, we will respond by all means. If our legitimate interests and the interests of Russian people are directly affected, as was the case in South Ossetia, I see no way to respond other than doping so in full compliance with international law. Those who threaten the security of Russian citizens jeopardise the security of the whole country,” Lavrov said.

He stressed the fact that Russian troops were staying on the territory of Russia. “Demands for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document of 2011 and the Treaty on Open Skies were satisfied. Inspectors from the United States, the European Union and Ukraine visited Russian troops’ bases and could not cite even one fact that would signify dangerous military activities on the part of Russia,” the minister said.

“We are on our own territory and are not taking any actions that would go against our obligations,” he said. “Ukrainian troops are also staying on their territory, but the difference is that they have an order allowing them to use weapons against peaceful citizens. This is a criminal order.","KIEV, April 26, /ITAR-TASS/.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the Russia Today television channel this week that Russian troops were staying on their own territory and were not taking any steps that would go against their obligations.

“We have never denied the fact that we sent additional troops to the border [with Ukraine] just as the Ukrainian government redeployed its troops closer to our border. Our troops are conducting exercises on the territory of our own country. Such exercises are conducted regularly since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister,” Lavrov said.

Exercises are held in different parts of Russia. “As far as I know, the next exercises will be held in the north-west of the country. This is a continuous process. The army must be in good shape and ready to act while hoping that it will not have to interfere,” the minister said.

“However, if we are attacked, we will respond by all means. If our legitimate interests and the interests of Russian people are directly affected, as was the case in South Ossetia, I see no way to respond other than doping so in full compliance with international law. Those who threaten the security of Russian citizens jeopardise the security of the whole country,” Lavrov said.

He stressed the fact that Russian troops were staying on the territory of Russia. “Demands for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document of 2011 and the Treaty on Open Skies were satisfied. Inspectors from the United States, the European Union and Ukraine visited Russian troops’ bases and could not cite even one fact that would signify dangerous military activities on the part of Russia,” the minister said.

“We are on our own territory and are not taking any actions that would go against our obligations,” he said. “Ukrainian troops are also staying on their territory, but the difference is that they have an order allowing them to use weapons against peaceful citizens. This is a criminal order.",529

The patient is a health-care provider who recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to provide health care, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

The person, an American male, traveled on April 24 from Riyadh to London, then to Chicago, and took a bus to Indiana, officials said. He began experiencing shortness of breath, coughing, and fever on April 27, according to the Indiana State Department of Health.

The patient was admitted to Community Hospital in Munster, Indiana, on April 28, the same day he visited the emergency department there, the health department said. He has been isolated and is in stable condition. He is receiving oxygen support, but does not require a ventilator, Schuchat said.

MERS unlikely to cause a pandemic -- for now, experts say

The virus poses a very low risk to the broader general public, Schuchat said, as it has not been shown to spread easily from person to person.

The CDC and the Indiana State Department of Health are conducting a joint investigation into the case, according to a CDC statement. The CDC confirmed Indiana test results on Friday.

The CDC, IDPH (Illinois Department of Public Health) and CDPH (Chicago Department of Public Health) do not consider passengers on the flight or bus to be close contacts of the patient and therefore are not at high risk, said Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, director of the IDPH.

Passengers on the same plane and bus as the patient will be contacted by the CDC as a precautionary measure, starting Saturday, the Illinois statement said. If the CDC identifies ill individuals with possible MERS-CoV, it will notify health officials in Chicago and Indiana.

There is no reason to suspect any current risk to travelers or employees at O'Hare Airport at this time, said CDPH commissioner Bechara Choucair.

The coronavirus, known as MERS-CoV, was first reported in the Middle East -- specifically, the Arabian Peninsula -- in 2012.

Laboratory testing has confirmed 262 cases of the coronavirus in 12 countries, including the Indiana case, Schuchat said. Ninety-three people have died.

So far, all MERS cases have been linked to six countries on or near the Arabian Peninsula, Schuchat said.

The Saudi Ministry of Health has reported 339 cases, and said nearly a third of those have died. Not all of the Saudi cases have been confirmed by the World Health Organization.

The MERS virus is of grave concern because of the virulence, Schuchat said. But, she added, We're not yet aware of confirmed sustained community transmission.

Late last month, Saudi officials noted a spike in new cases.

The CDC has expected MERS to come to the United States, Schuchat said. We have been preparing for this.

However, The introduction of MERS-CoV is another reminder that diseases are just a plane ride away, she said.

Opinion: Why MERS virus is so scary

MERS-CoV comes from the same group of viruses as the common cold and attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms, which include fever, cough and shortness of breath, can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure.

The CDC has issued general precautions such as frequent hand-washing, avoiding close contact with infected people, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, and disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched.

Pediatricians should ask about where young patients with high fever and respiratory symptoms have traveled, Schuchat said.

Young children often have fever and respiratory symptoms, but the key here is: Was there a history of travel within the past 14 days to the Arabian Peninsula, or contact with someone? ... They should alert their clinician about that travel or contact, Schuchat said.

Currently, the CDC does not recommend changing travel plans because of the virus, Schuchat said.

No one knows exactly how this virus originated, but evidence is emerging implicating camels. In a recently published study in mBio, researchers said they isolated live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. They found multiple substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient.

The same group of researchers reported in February that nearly three-quarters of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past exposure to the MERS coronavirus.

MERS mystery: Virus found in camels

Although many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere, including in European countries and Tunisia in North Africa. Egypt reported its first case on April 26, according to the WHO.

Limited human-to-human transmission of the disease has also occurred in other countries -- meaning some people who traveled to the Middle East gave the virus to others.

Officials are not aware of any other confirmed U.S. cases, Schuchat said, adding it's too early to assume no one else is ill. An active investigation is underway.

“I submitted a request for a telephone talk with the Russian foreign minister and we hope that all these efforts will result in the release of the hostages,” Deshchytsia said during a press briefing Wednesday.

Late last week, activists in Slaviansk detained on suspicion of espionage 11 members of a military mission under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including eight Europeans and three Ukrainians.

Following negotiations, one of the OSCE team members, Swedish military officer Ingvi Thomas Johanson, was released for medical reasons.

Deshchytsia said that the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry was in close contact with officials from the home countries of the citizens being held by self-defense forces in Slaviansk, in particular Germany, Poland and Denmark.

“We also conduct regular consultations with the OSCE Monitoring Mission,” the acting minister said, adding that the head of the mission is currently in Donetsk for meetings with regional authorities to assess the situation.

On Tuesday, Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Danylo Lubkivsky announced that Kiev had devised a plan to secure the release of the OSCE observers. US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called on Russia Monday to help secure the release of the remaining inspectors.

In a signal Washington will keep pressure on Iran over its nuclear program, the U.S. Treasury Department said it was sanctioning eight of Chinese businessman Li Fangwei's Chinese companies for allegedly procuring missile parts for Iran.

The U.S. State Department said it was offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Li, who is also known as Karl Lee.

Li has been the target of U.S. sanctions in the past for his alleged role as a principle supplier to Iran's ballistic missile program.

The State Department said the announcement of the bounty for Li was coordinated with Treasury and the Justice Department, which unsealed an indictment against him on charges including conspiracy to commit money laundering, bank fraud, and wire fraud.

According to the Indictment, he (Li) controls a large network of front companies and allegedly uses this network to move millions of dollars through U.S.-based financial institutions to conduct business in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, which prohibit such financial transactions, the State Department said in a statement.

Treasury also said it was targeting a firm based in Dubai and several associated individuals for helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions against its oil industry.

Iran and a group of world powers reached a temporary deal in November under which Tehran would get about $7 billion in sanctions relief in return for steps to restrain its nuclear activities.

The deal called for negotiation of a full agreement within a year, and Treasury said on Tuesday it was still pressing for a more definitive resolution.

We will continue vigorously to enforce our sanctions, even as we explore the possibility of a comprehensive deal addressing Iran's nuclear program, Treasury Under Secretary David Cohen, who oversees sanctions policy, said in a statement.

A United Nations report said earlier this month that Iran has acted to cut its most sensitive nuclear stockpile by nearly 75 percent, making clear Tehran is undertaking the agreed steps to curb its nuclear program.

A U.S. official, however, told Reuters last month Iran had pursued a longstanding effort to buy banned components for its nuclear and missile programs in recent months, even while it was striking an interim deal with major powers to limit its disputed atomic activity.

Vann Van Diepen, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for international security and non-proliferation, added that Li had continued to supply such items despite U.S. pressure on China to tighten export controls.

Contacted by Reuters on Feb 4, 2013, for an earlier story about his business, Li said he continued to get commercial inquiries from Iran but only for legitimate merchandise. Li said his metals company, LIMMT, had stopped selling to Iran once the United States began sanctioning the firm several years ago.

China has said that it is very clear in its stance on non-proliferation and that it has seriously fulfilled its obligations to U.N. resolutions about export controls.

"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/worldNews/~3/_1becb5ANWE/story01.htm","REUTERS","Sun- 27 Apr 2014 07-06-58 GMT","Congestion capital Brussels looks to unclog traffic arteries","Congestion capital Brussels looks to unclog traffic arteriesBRUSSELS (Reuters) - For two years running, Brussels has been named the most congested city in North America and western Europe, a mark of shame for the capital that guides Europe's environment and transport policies.

The disgrace has, however, had the effect of uniting Belgium's environmentalist Green Party, center-right rivals N-VA and business and motoring groups in a call for a solution whose time may finally have come - charging drivers for distance traveled. Tests have already begun.

Others are watching keenly to see what will work in a city the size of Brussels, whose issues are different from sprawling megacities like Bangkok or Beijing, or London, with its central congestion charge.

Since London brought in their congestion scheme, technology has come a long way, said Nina Renshaw, deputy director of sustainable transport campaign group Transport & Environment.

Today it's possible using GPS (global positioning systems) to have precise billing per kilometer which wasn't possible even 10 years ago, she said. That makes it much more attractive for cities to consider it.

Cities in the Netherlands and Sweden are among those who want to reduce congestion but also cut carbon emissions, an effort in which Europe sees itself as setting an example.

The European Commission estimates traffic congestion costs at nearly 100 billion euros per year, or 1 percent of the European Union's gross domestic product, not including the health costs of pollution.

The latter has led to the rise of low emission zones in cities from Umea in northern Sweden to Naples in southern Italy. Air pollution from traffic prompted Paris to ban cars with even number plates from entering the city for a day in March.

Bruno De Lille, Green Party member and mobility secretary for the Brussels region, is skeptical his city really is the developed world's capital of congestion, as traffic services provider INRIX says, but acknowledges his city has some unique problems.

One is Belgium's high population density, ranked 10th in the world, excluding small island or city states such as Malta or Singapore.

It also has a tax system that encourages company cars and compensates the cost of driving to work, with the former taxed at a lower rate than salaries and the latter able partially to be offset against tax.

Moreover, more than half of the 650,000 people employed in Brussels live outside city limits.

Around half of those commute into the city by car, a higher proportion than in most European cities. Eurostat data shows the same figure in Amsterdam is 40 percent, for example. In Washington DC, the percentage is also around 40 percent, and for Chicago, it is 50 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

So far Brussels has tried to fight traffic creep by making public transport more attractive with special bus or tram lanes. That has worked by convincing many commuters to switch to public transport or bicycles, but has also created its own problems.

What we've seen in the last 10 years is that we've got 7 percent fewer cars on the roads, but the jams have got longer. That's because there's less room for cars, De Lille said.

On weekday mornings, there are a combined 150-200 km (93-124 miles) of jams on 7,000 km of Belgian highways on average, according to motorist association Touring. The record, set on one day in March last year, was 1,400 km of jams.

THE SOLUTION

The most common way of tackling traffic congestion, and the pollution it causes, has been a congestion zone, such as those in place in London, Stockholm and Milan.

London's 10-pound charge has reduced car traffic by 27 percent since its introduction in 2003. Milan dropped off the top of the INRIX congestion standings after it introduced a charge in 2012.

Brussels is considering a combination of steps, including a rapid regional rail system along the lines of Paris's RER.

But if we want the cars to move more freely then we have to take another step, De Lille said.

The proposal to charge drivers per kilometer traveled is already on trial with around 1,000 volunteers in the city and neighboring regions of Flanders and Wallonia.

In the trial, the volunteers' driving patterns and distances are measured. If they subsequently drive less they are rewarded with cash, while activity over the norm is noted. In real life, people would be charged electronically or via ticketing for driving during peak hours.

The idea is backed by the Flemish separatist party N-VA, currently the largest party in parliament, albeit balanced against reductions of annual road tax, as well as business bodies, the Belgian auto federation Febiac and Touring.

First public responses have been negative: an online petition opposing the scheme quickly gained over 170,000 signatories.

In the past decade, plans for congestion charges in Manchester and Edinburgh were rejected in referendums.

But Transport & Environment says public opinion can shift sharply once road pricing is set up. In Stockholm, for example, a poll showed very strong support for its congestion charge a year after its launch.

Transport & Environment also says that a kilometer charge is a more effective way to cut congestion and emissions than a congestion charge which some users simply get used to.

We prefer the kilometer charges because if you pay a one-off fee you're incentivized to maximize your driving within that period, said Transport & Environment's Renshaw.

Jeroen Verhoeven of Bral, a group seeking to make Brussels more livable, believes a combination of congestion zone and distance charge would be best.

With just the former, there is no discouragement to drive after taking the one-off hit. With just the latter, drivers may still be inclined to make short trips in the city.

Joost Kaesemans of Febiac, who says he regularly cycles to work, says the time lost to traffic jams has doubled in Belgium since 2007.

In a report with PwC last year, Febiac said cutting traffic by just 5-10 percent could reduce congestion by 40 percent.

Road pricing is a system you can influence yourself. We estimate that 20 percent of the peak-time traffic doesn't have to be there at that time, he said.

Is it for tomorrow? It could take until after 2020 ... but doing nothing is not an option.

(Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - For two years running, Brussels has been named the most congested city in North America and western Europe, a mark of shame for the capital that guides Europe's environment and transport policies.

The disgrace has, however, had the effect of uniting Belgium's environmentalist Green Party, center-right rivals N-VA and business and motoring groups in a call for a solution whose time may finally have come - charging drivers for distance traveled. Tests have already begun.

Others are watching keenly to see what will work in a city the size of Brussels, whose issues are different from sprawling megacities like Bangkok or Beijing, or London, with its central congestion charge.

Since London brought in their congestion scheme, technology has come a long way, said Nina Renshaw, deputy director of sustainable transport campaign group Transport & Environment.

Today it's possible using GPS (global positioning systems) to have precise billing per kilometer which wasn't possible even 10 years ago, she said. That makes it much more attractive for cities to consider it.

Cities in the Netherlands and Sweden are among those who want to reduce congestion but also cut carbon emissions, an effort in which Europe sees itself as setting an example.

The European Commission estimates traffic congestion costs at nearly 100 billion euros per year, or 1 percent of the European Union's gross domestic product, not including the health costs of pollution.

The latter has led to the rise of low emission zones in cities from Umea in northern Sweden to Naples in southern Italy. Air pollution from traffic prompted Paris to ban cars with even number plates from entering the city for a day in March.

Bruno De Lille, Green Party member and mobility secretary for the Brussels region, is skeptical his city really is the developed world's capital of congestion, as traffic services provider INRIX says, but acknowledges his city has some unique problems.

One is Belgium's high population density, ranked 10th in the world, excluding small island or city states such as Malta or Singapore.

It also has a tax system that encourages company cars and compensates the cost of driving to work, with the former taxed at a lower rate than salaries and the latter able partially to be offset against tax.

Moreover, more than half of the 650,000 people employed in Brussels live outside city limits.

Around half of those commute into the city by car, a higher proportion than in most European cities. Eurostat data shows the same figure in Amsterdam is 40 percent, for example. In Washington DC, the percentage is also around 40 percent, and for Chicago, it is 50 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

So far Brussels has tried to fight traffic creep by making public transport more attractive with special bus or tram lanes. That has worked by convincing many commuters to switch to public transport or bicycles, but has also created its own problems.

What we've seen in the last 10 years is that we've got 7 percent fewer cars on the roads, but the jams have got longer. That's because there's less room for cars, De Lille said.

On weekday mornings, there are a combined 150-200 km (93-124 miles) of jams on 7,000 km of Belgian highways on average, according to motorist association Touring. The record, set on one day in March last year, was 1,400 km of jams.

THE SOLUTION

The most common way of tackling traffic congestion, and the pollution it causes, has been a congestion zone, such as those in place in London, Stockholm and Milan.

London's 10-pound charge has reduced car traffic by 27 percent since its introduction in 2003. Milan dropped off the top of the INRIX congestion standings after it introduced a charge in 2012.

Brussels is considering a combination of steps, including a rapid regional rail system along the lines of Paris's RER.

But if we want the cars to move more freely then we have to take another step, De Lille said.

The proposal to charge drivers per kilometer traveled is already on trial with around 1,000 volunteers in the city and neighboring regions of Flanders and Wallonia.

“Ukraine has just signed with Slovakia, namely with Slovak Transit Company Eustream, a memorandum on the cooperation in the energy field , which stipulates the start of reverse natural gas supplies through the territory of Slovakia,” Yatsenyuk said.

“According to this memorandum, if all parties meet the terms of the [mentioned] memorandum, we will be able to receive 8 billion cubic meters of gas per year,” he added.

Following Russia’s decision to cancel all discounts for Ukraine’s Naftogaz in early April, the company started importing gas from Europe through Poland. The total amount of reverse gas delivered to Ukraine via this route is currently estimated at a modest 1.5 billion cubic meters per year.

The new agreement with Slovakia, according to Naftogaz estimates, will guarantee up to 30 billion cubic meters of gas annually.

European Commission spokeswoman Sabine Berger said earlier that in accordance with the memorandum, Ukraine could import as much as 8 billion cubic meters of gas through the Slovak pipeline starting this fall.

Under a number of agreements between Russia and Ukraine, Kiev received unprecedented privileges and discounts on the price of Russian natural gas. In December, Moscow gave Ukraine a 30 percent discount on gas in addition to a $15 billion bailout.

Last month, the head of Russian state energy giant Gazprom said the company was annulling its discount on natural gas sales to Ukraine beginning in April.

“The United States, working closely with its partners, remains prepared to impose still greater costs on Russia if the Russian leadership continues these provocations instead of de-escalating the situation, consistent with its Geneva commitments,” Carney said.

Konstantinov echoed him by saying that a resumption of the army operation in the south-eastern regions of Ukraine “will be the last attack of the Kiev authorities. They touch one person and get a response ten times bigger.”

He believes that Kiev is creating a situation “which cannot last forever”. “The people who have come to power in Kiev are inadequate. I won’t be surprised if they proclaim Hitler their honorary leader tomorrow. I think that sooner or later this Nazi orgy will have to be stopped so that it does not bring disgrace upon the Russian world before the eyes of the whole planet,” Konstantinov said.",362

Russian President Vladimir Putin is receiving all urgent information about developments in southeast Ukraine due to the start of a punitive Kiev operation with armed forces and combat aviation involved in the regions, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said adde.

“The Americans never intended to help us build our country. Now Kabul is asking them not to leave Afghanistan so that the Taliban will not attack them,” a Pashtun from Kabul in his Moscow shop muses.

“Just imagine: we had 44 countries invading Afghanistan with
  modern weapons, satellite monitoring, tanks and missiles. The
  Taliban has an army of less than 20,000. We have 400,000 Afghan
  troops and 200,000 Americans with the most advanced weaponry. How
  is it possible that they can’t prevail over the Taliban?” he
  says.



  A PhD-qualified engineer by profession, he trades a range of
  Oriental items from hookahs to incense sticks. We’ve been talking
  about the elections for two hours, with visitors coming in and
  leaving without being served, and other Afghans joining our
  discussion with eagerness.



  There are only a handful of places in Moscow where you can get a
  glimpse of people from different Afghan tribes and social strata.
  One of them is a former hotel in the city suburbs housing a
  multitude of shops and firms owned by Afghans. They all retain
  close ties with their homeland, make regular visits and keep
  daily contact with their families and business partners.



  Those who do business in Russia usually have quite a good
  background and a decent profession. They work here despite the
  fact the clans they come from fought the Soviet army in
  1979-1989. But that was a long time ago. The US army has been in
  Afghanistan for 13 years and Afghans do not have much respect for
  either the Americans or those who they support.



  Endangered elections



  Elections in the east are being increasingly associated with
  terror acts and mysterious problems with vote counting.



  Ironically, political analysts may soon pick up some of the
  language used by journalists. The developments in Afghanistan and
  Iraq indicate that elections in a country with a US troop
  presence are always hailed as success, while a vote in a country
  left by US troops merely serves as a backdrop for terror attacks.



  Curiously enough, in the old Western democracies the elites
  negotiate before the elections, whereas in Afghanistan, it looks
  like the election comes prior to negotiations. This seems to be
  the only explanation as to why it takes them almost three weeks
  to count the votes, and why they’ve postponed the announcement of
  the results for the 4th time. The election took place on April 5
  and the votes were supposed to be counted by April 24. Then it
  was postponed to May 14, so that the second round could start on
  May 28.



  I’d like to remind that four years ago, it took Iraq a record
  four months to count the votes from its election. The current
  prime minister stayed in office, but his bloc in the parliament
  lost one vote to the opposition.



  The behind-the-scenes struggle continues in Afghanistan. It would
  be na?ve to believe that the Afghan independent commission is
  unable to count quickly. The clans and advisers just didn’t rush
  it, as they were fighting for the second round and for the
  difference in votes.



  Right now this difference has become more distinct, when the
  conventional anti-Americanism pole represented by Abdullah
  Abdullah got the upper hand over the most pro-American candidate,
  Ashraf Ghani.



  This division is quite feeble though. Before the election they
  both had stated that they supported the presence of the US troops
  in the country. Whereas President Karzai finished his tenure with
  a patriotic gesture of refusing to sign the agreement for the US
  troop presence. He also took his brother off the presidential
  candidates’ list and directed his supporters to unlikely
  candidate Zamlai Rassoul.



  At the moment, according to another preliminary count, Abdullah
  Abdullah wins this election. He looks more or less remote from
  the occupation forces compared to other candidates. His name is
  associated with Ahmad Shakh Massoud, who was mysteriously
  murdered on September 11, 2001. Many believe he was a Mujahideen
  physician, if not a Mujahideen himself.



  Abdullah does have a flaw in his biography. From the viewpoint of
  a Pashtun, the main Afghan tribe, he is a Tajik, as is his
  mother. “Can a Tajik rule Afghanistan?” This is
  something any Pashtun would ask you, unless they are related to
  the occupation forces. Moreover, his name is related to the
  reputation of the Afghan Northern Alliance, which welcomed the US
  presence and had close cooperation with it.



  However, for Afghans one’s origin isn’t the main concern. More
  importantly, these people who really value their independence
  feel that they have been invaded, in spite of the elections,
  speeches and promises. The behind-the-scenes war which they sense
  more clearly than the foreign observers do is a part of this
  invasion.



  Difficult choice



  What do the Afghan people think of the election? Most of the
  Moscow-based Afghans are happy to discuss it, but they don’t want
  their pictures taken.



  Young Pashtuns aren’t very optimistic. I am talking to a Pashtun
  from Herat. He says he preferred Mohammad Ismail Khan, if anyone.
  He may be a Tajik but he is a Mujahideen, Herat-born and had been
  its governor for a long time.


“Otherwise they all are crooks, and all they want is to sell
  out to the Americans,” he says about the presidential
  candidates.



  I ask him to clarify what’s there to sell in Afghanistan, as none
  of the shops have any Afghan products.


“What’s there to sell? The whole of Afghanistan,” he
  answers.



  Most Afghans are convinced that their country is a crucial
  strategic center that the US wants to have just for the sake of
  it.



  A Pashtun from Kabul has no respect for either of the candidates.
  He believes there was no voter turnout at all. Some of his family
  members did go to vote, and they told him there was no frenzy
  there.



  A Pashtun called Nabi was born in Laghman. He had spent 10 years
  in prison during the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. He is an
  Afghan Marxist, and as most supporters of one Marxist fraction he
  became imprisoned when the other fraction got the upper hand.
  Just like many older Afghans, he is an underground revolutionary,
  a fighter, and a political prisoner who got self-educated while
  in prison, and his opinions are quite harsh.



  The reason he doesn’t support Abdullah is not the fact that he is
  a Tajik. “Hekmatyar is a Pashtun, but he is also a traitor,
  just like Abdullah is. And so is Sayyaf - a Pashtun and a
  traitor,” he says. Marxists are very open about using strong
  terms.


“Abdullah bears the shadow of a traitor, as he had cooperated
  with everyone, just like his commander, Massoud,” says Nabi.
  “His people sold our concessions for mineral deposits
  extraction.”


  Nabi prefers Ghani, even though he bears “a stamp of the
  American past.”


  Khusrow, a Tajik from Herat, openly chooses Abdullah because he
  is Tajik.


“His mother is Tajik, so Pashtuns regard him as a
  stranger,” he says. “They say that he, who shakes hands
  with the ruler, will come to power too,” he is trying to say
  that those people who are on a first-name basis with the
  authorities are well connected.


“Abdullah will definitely get more votes, but such people as
  Abdullah can never be president. So Ghani is more likely to
  become the leader,” he sadly says. “Pashtuns will always
  rule in Afghanistan, and all the others will play football and
  fight,” Khusrow predicts.



  His Tajik friend who comes from Kabul has moved his family to
  India.


“I’m not into politics. We didn’t vote for anyone – there is
  nobody worth voting for.”


  The Hazara brothers, Ysa and Nadyr, are split. Nadyr supports
  Abdullah out of principle.


“Pashtuns didn’t like the Taliban people as well, although
  they were Pashtuns too. I support Abdullah, not because he is
  Pashtun, but because he plans for the future,” he says.



  He likes it that Abdullah participates in elections together with
  Mouhakkik who is Hazara.


“He has always been a part of our society, he gets us. He has
  been our leader for a long time. I think Abdullah will win.
  Ghani’s deputy Sarwar Danesh is Hazara too. He is pro-Iranian,
  unlike Mouhakkik, who is not so pro-Iranian. But we just want him
  to help his people – that’s what matters.”


  He hopes Abdullah can make a good president because he is
  slightly against Pakistan and against the USA.



  Ysa doesn’t agree. “Ghani is very experienced. He is like
  Putin, who looks ahead.”


  And that’s when Ysa thinks about the flipside.


“I once asked a politician, why Russia doesn’t supply its
  missiles to Iran or Syria. He said it’s a policy. Politicians are
  not trustworthy – today they think this way, the next day they
  change their mind. Sayyaf had an agreement with the Hazara too,
  but eventually they got no protection. So the policy is like
  that: today we are friends, tomorrow we are foes.”


  He has no doubt that Ghani is going to win in the second round of
  the elections.


“Do you think Ghani will bring another USA? It was already
  brought [to Afghanistan] 13 years ago,” Nadyr argues.


“The Americans spent $600 billion in Afghanistan so they will
  not let us go. They went there to prop up their positions against
  Russia, China and Central Asia. The US has plans in Afghanistan
  for 50 years ahead. They will leave at least 10,000 troops there
  for sure. Ghani appeals to them simply because he is
  pro-American,” Nadyr says.



  Many people in Afghanistan believe the Taliban has been created
  and imposed by the US too, and it was aimed at taking over the
  country. Nadyr and Ysa have no doubts about that.


“Some of Ghani’s advisors speak out against the Hazara all
  the time. Moreover, his wife is not a Muslim, she’s from
  Lebanon,” which, by the way, is a serious point in
  Afghanistan.


“Russia came here with tanks, while the US came to
  Afghanistan with television and cash. It takes a long time for
  them, but eventually they get what they want. They set up a base
  here. People are against them and want them to leave, to which
  Americans respond, “OK, we are leaving.” But there are always
  those who ask them to stay,” Nadyr says, meaning both
  candidates are willing to sign the agreement on further presence
  of the US troops.


“They started the mess in Ukraine while being here and now
  make troubles in Dagestan. They aim at stirring up troubles in
  order to isolate Russia from the rest of the world. The Afghan
  people understand the essence of the US policy quite well now.
  But Americans also target the young people. There are some who
  think that since Americans brought television and the internet,
  they should stay,” Ysa says, apparently not minding. He is
  among these young people.


“Nothing happens the way we want,” Ysa admits. And
  that’s true – nobody has asked the Afghan people in the last 35
  years what they really want.

A photo taken by a Western journalist shows Ukrainian troops menacing a reporter for Russian news outlet LifeNews and forcing him to get on his knees at a checkpoint between the Kharkov and Donetsk regions in eastern Ukraine.


  This latest incident in a series of violations of journalists’
  professional rights in Ukraine occurred as LifeNews’
  correspondent, Sergey Golyandin, attempted to talk to armed
  people about making a report at the checkpoint Friday. The
  journalist was only fulfilling his duties as a correspondent for
  the TV channel and tried to obtain non-classified information,
  LifeNews said on its website.



  The checkpoint was located not far from the Barvenkovo railway
  station, through which Kiev troops were redeployed ahead of the
  military operation against anti-government protesters in the town
  of Slavyansk, Golyandin told RT. He said their crew got to the
  venue in a taxi and – when they saw foreign journalists being
  thoroughly searched – decided not to risk continuing and stopped.



  Golyandin decided first to have a talk with the armed people at
  the site and ask them if he could interview any of them and film.
  The reporter said he held his press card in his right hand, so
  that the military could see it. However, as he was about 30
  meters from the checkpoint, guards on the perimeter of the
  facility “pointed machine guns at me,” he said.



  “I was told in rather a rude way to lie on the ground, face
  down. I bent on my knees. Two guys with machine guns and another
  person with a gun approached me on one side, and two more guys
  with machine guns on the other,” he said in a comment to RT.



  The military behaved in “a pretty aggressive” way, he
  noted. Only after they found that he was a journalist was
  Golyandin allowed to get back on his feet and talk to them for
  some time. Still, they banned the journalist from using his
  camera and filming anything.



  However, in a private conversation the soldiers told the Russian
  journalists that “they do not want a war,” Golyandin
  said. In their opinion Right Sector’s special forces Dnepr-1 and
  Dnepr-2 are behind “all provocations and firing at
  checkpoints,” Golyandin said.



  “Then we were told to get out of the place as soon as
  possible,” the LifeNews reporter added.



  The incident was recorded, however, by a foreign correspondent
  present at the site and the image was later posted in Global Look
  Press and other photo banks.



  In a separate incident this week, two LifeNews journalists were
  detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) while they were
  filming an interview with an opposition leader and then deported
  to Russia.



  On Monday, Simon Ostrovsky, a journalist for the New York-based
  Vice News, was detained by self-defense forces in Slavyansk,
  eastern Ukraine. He was released three days later, on Thursday.



  Lately, there have been an increasing number of incidents with
  Russian journalists on Ukrainian territory, with reporters being
  detained, questioned for hours, threatened, deported or banned
  from entering the country.



  Heads of Russian TV channels, including RT, have called on international organizations to

  to “defend the professional rights of journalists working in
  Ukraine.”","Ukrainian military forcing Russian reporter to kneel caught on camera

A photo taken by a Western journalist shows Ukrainian troops menacing a reporter for Russian news outlet LifeNews and forcing him to get on his knees at a checkpoint between the Kharkov and Donetsk regions in eastern Ukraine.


  This latest incident in a series of violations of journalists’
  professional rights in Ukraine occurred as LifeNews’
  correspondent, Sergey Golyandin, attempted to talk to armed
  people about making a report at the checkpoint Friday. The
  journalist was only fulfilling his duties as a correspondent for
  the TV channel and tried to obtain non-classified information,
  LifeNews said on its website.



  The checkpoint was located not far from the Barvenkovo railway
  station, through which Kiev troops were redeployed ahead of the
  military operation against anti-government protesters in the town
  of Slavyansk, Golyandin told RT. He said their crew got to the
  venue in a taxi and – when they saw foreign journalists being
  thoroughly searched – decided not to risk continuing and stopped.



  Golyandin decided first to have a talk with the armed people at
  the site and ask them if he could interview any of them and film.
  The reporter said he held his press card in his right hand, so
  that the military could see it. However, as he was about 30
  meters from the checkpoint, guards on the perimeter of the
  facility “pointed machine guns at me,” he said.



  “I was told in rather a rude way to lie on the ground, face
  down. I bent on my knees. Two guys with machine guns and another
  person with a gun approached me on one side, and two more guys
  with machine guns on the other,” he said in a comment to RT.



  The military behaved in “a pretty aggressive” way, he
  noted. Only after they found that he was a journalist was
  Golyandin allowed to get back on his feet and talk to them for
  some time. Still, they banned the journalist from using his
  camera and filming anything.



  However, in a private conversation the soldiers told the Russian
  journalists that “they do not want a war,” Golyandin
  said. In their opinion Right Sector’s special forces Dnepr-1 and
  Dnepr-2 are behind “all provocations and firing at
  checkpoints,” Golyandin said.



  “Then we were told to get out of the place as soon as
  possible,” the LifeNews reporter added.



  The incident was recorded, however, by a foreign correspondent
  present at the site and the image was later posted in Global Look
  Press and other photo banks.



  In a separate incident this week, two LifeNews journalists were
  detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) while they were
  filming an interview with an opposition leader and then deported
  to Russia.



  On Monday, Simon Ostrovsky, a journalist for the New York-based
  Vice News, was detained by self-defense forces in Slavyansk,
  eastern Ukraine. He was released three days later, on Thursday.



  Lately, there have been an increasing number of incidents with
  Russian journalists on Ukrainian territory, with reporters being
  detained, questioned for hours, threatened, deported or banned
  from entering the country.



  Heads of Russian TV channels, including RT, have called on international organizations to
  protect the rights and dignity of journalists covering the
  Ukraine crisis from illegal actions of the Kiev authorities. In a
  letter addressed to the UN, UNESCO and the OSCE they urged them
  to “defend the professional rights of journalists working in

The Pentagon chief, in a speech on the future of the 28-nation alliance, said Russia's seizure of the Crimean peninsula and other action in the region had reminded NATO of its founding purpose and presented a clarifying moment for the transatlantic alliance.

He also raised a longstanding U.S. concern about NATO defense spending, noting that American outlays on security are three times that of the other 27 partners combined, even though the U.S. gross domestic product is smaller than their total GDP.

This lopsided burden threatens NATO's integrity, cohesion and capability - and ultimately, both European and transatlantic security, Hagel said in remarks at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. We must see renewed financial commitments from all NATO members.

Only four of the NATO partners met their agreed target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense in 2013 - Estonia, Greece, Britain and the United States. France and Turkey fell just shy of the 2 percent goal.

Hagel said one of the biggest obstacles to investment in defense was the sense that the prospect of conflict among nations had dissipated with the end of the Cold War.

Russia's actions in Ukraine shatter that myth and usher in bracing new realities, he said. Given Moscow's actions in Ukraine, NATO in the future should expect Russia to test our alliance's purpose, stamina and commitment, he added.

We cannot take for granted, even in Europe, that peace is underwritten by the credible deterrent of military power, the U.S. defense chief said, calling for greater coordination among the allies on defense investments as well as higher levels of spending.

Hagel's comments came amid increased violence between Ukrainian loyalists and Russian separatists despite an international peace deal, and echoed calls by other top U.S. officials this week for NATO members to shore up their commitments.

On Friday, pro-Russian rebels shot down two Ukrainian helicopters, killing two people, as Ukrainian forces tightened their siege of separatist-held Slaviansk.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday urged NATO allies who are not meeting the 2 percent defense spending benchmark to boost their payments to the alliance in the next five years.

To help meet the goal of increasing defense spending, Hagel called for NATO members' finance ministers or budget officials to attend an alliance meeting to discuss the issue.

Spending imbalances among the NATO partners has been a longstanding complaint of U.S. defense secretaries.

Three years ago, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates used his final speech in Europe as Pentagon chief to deliver a parting shot at the allies, saying the NATO members risked collective military irrelevance unless they bore more of the burden and boosted military spending.

His remarks came in the context of the Western-backed 2011 ouster of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's government, which exposed a number of weaknesses among the European partners' militaries, such as a lack of intelligence and reconnaissance aircraft and specialists needed to identify bombing targets.

Pro-Russian protesters have seized a local state TV station in the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, demanding that Russian TV channels be broadcast there. They also want to launch a “Donetsk People’s Republic” TV channel.


  According to media reports, technical work is currently being
  done at the TV station to restart the transmission of Russian
  channels. Itar-Tass reports that some Russian TV channels have
  resumed work in Donetsk.


“Their experts are now setting up equipment on our frequency
  to broadcast Russian TV channels,” TV station CEO Oleg
  Dzholos told Ukraine’s Channel 5, Interfax-Ukraine reported.



  One of the protesters has told the news agency that “Russia 24”
  channel is already broadcasting instead of local “Channel 27”.



  Protesters have left the building, but still left their security
  there.


“Nobody freed the TV station – protesters left, but there is
  our security there as well as our technicians and the station’s
  crew,” an unnamed man told Interfax-Ukraine.



  It has also been reported that pro-Russian protesters held talks
  with the TV center's executives to begin broadcasting the
  “Donetsk People's Republic” television channel.


“There were many demands. First – switch off Ukrainian
  channels. I explained that we are Donetsk state TV and radio
  station and from our central control room, there is only our
  signal. There were experts and they understood me. The following
  demand was – not a demand, an ultimatum – to switch on, if I am
  not mistaken, Russia-24 TV channel,” Dzholos said.



  So far, all Ukrainian TV channels continue their broadcast.



  Protesters entered the TV station late Sunday afternoon, saying
  they were unsatisfied with the way the situation in the region
  was covered in local news and shows. Protesters demanded that
  Ukrainian channels be blocked.



  They have taken down the Ukrainian flag from the TV station’s
  office and hoisted the flag of the self-proclaimed Donetsk
  People’s Republic. It was also taken down later.



  Protesters brought satellite antennas and other equipment and
  placed guards at the entrance to the television center, Itar-Tass
  reported.



  Prior to taking control of the TV station, over 3,000 people
  gathered at Donetsk's central Lenin Square. Protesters started
  the rally with one minute's silence to commemorate Berkut Special
  Forces officers killed in clashes with radicals in Kiev's
  Independence Square, and activists killed by Right Sector
  radicals at a checkpoint in Slavyansk on Easter Sunday.



  Russian TV channels have been blocked across Ukraine since the
  beginning of March, after the Ukrainian media watchdog claimed
  that shutting down Russian TV stations ensured the country’s
  “national security and sovereignty.”


  At least five major Russian channels, including Vesti, Russia-24,
  Channel One’s international broadcasts, RTR ‘Planeta’ and NTV
  World were immediately excluded from the list of options by
  providers throughout Ukraine.



  The move was strongly condemned by the OSCE, which called the move “repressive” and “a
  form of censorship.”


  Since then, the situation in Donetsk has deteriorated, with
  people demanding a referendum on the region’s autonomy from Kiev.

  stormed and seized by anti-government activists, Kiev launched an

The US economy came to a near standstill in the first quarter of 2014, growing at one of its weakest paces since 2012. The slow growth could indicate that America's post-recession honeymoon is over.


  Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or the total sum of all goods and
  services produced within the USA, only advanced 0.1 percent in
  the first three-month period of 2014, the Commerce Department
  said on Wednesday.
  
  The report is a preliminary estimate and can be revised
  significantly, either up or down.
  
  Economic momentum slowed down due to the effects of extreme
  winter weather, as well as a decrease in business spending.
  Exports fell at a rate of 7.6 percent in the first quarter – the
  biggest fall since the recession ended. The frigid weather could
  be to blame for less consumer spending, which only increased at a
  rate of 0.4 percent.
  
  The slowdown is in stark contrast to the 3.4 percent economic
  expansion that the US enjoyed in the second half of 2013.
  
  “We’ve been living in sub-3 percent land, and people have gotten
  used to that as the new normal. But it's not. It's anemic,” Dan
  North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, told The
  New York Times.
  
  America's economy slowed drastically in the first quarter of
  2014, as wintry weather depressed corporate spending and housing
  sector activity. Smaller additions to inventories by farmers and
  businesses also held back growth.
  
  Business spending dropped 2.1 percent between January and March,
  as companies spent less on buildings, equipment, and intellectual
  property.
  
  Federal spending is set to grow in 2014, which could help offset
  the lackluster first quarter growth. Most economists are
  predicting an overall growth of between 2.5 and three percent.

  meeting and will likely announce another $10 billion in monthly

Future historians will note that in April 2014, nearly a quarter-century after the end of the Soviet Union, the White House declared a new Cold War on Russia.


  And that, in a grave failure of representative democracy, there
  was scarcely a public word of debate, much less opposition, from
  the American political or media establishment.



  The Obama administration announced its Cold War indirectly, in a
  front-page New York Times story by Peter Baker on April 20.
  According to the report, President Obama has resolved, because of
  the Ukraine crisis, that he can “never have a constructive
  relationship” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and will
  instead “ignore the master of the Kremlin” and focus on
  “isolating…Russia by cutting off its economic and political
  ties to the outside world…effectively making it a pariah
  state.” In short, Baker reports, the White House has adopted
  “an updated version of the Cold War strategy of
  containment.” He might have added, a very extreme version.
  The report has been neither denied nor qualified by the White
  House.



  No modern precedent exists for the shameful complicity of the
  American political-media elite at this fateful turning point.
  Considerable congressional and mainstream media debate, even
  protest, were voiced, for example, during the run-up to the US
  wars in Vietnam and Iraq and, more recently, proposed wars
  against Iran and Syria. This Cold War—its epicenter on Russia’s
  borders; undertaken amid inflammatory American, Russian and
  Ukrainian media misinformation; and unfolding without the
  stabilizing practices that prevented disasters during the
  preceding Cold War—may be even more perilous. It will almost
  certainly result in a new nuclear arms race, a prospect made
  worse by Obama’s provocative public assertion that “our
  conventional forces are significantly superior to the
  Russians’,” and possibly an actual war with Russia triggered
  by Ukraine’s looming civil war. (NATO and Russian forces are
  already mobilizing on the country’s western and eastern borders,
  while the US-backed Kiev government is warning of a “third
  world war.”)



  And yet, all this has come with the virtually unanimous,
  bipartisan support, or indifference, of the US political
  establishment, from left to right, Democrats and Republicans,
  progressives (whose domestic programs will be gravely endangered)
  and conservatives. It has also been supported by mainstream media
  that shape and reflect policy-making opinion, from the Times and
  The Washington Post to The Wall Street Journal, from The New
  Republic to The Weekly Standard, from MSNBC to Fox News, from NPR
  to commercial radio news. (There are notable exceptions,
  including this magazine, but none close enough to the mainstream
  to be “authoritative” inside the Beltway.)



  To be more specific, not one of the 535 members of Congress has
  publicly expressed doubts about the White House’s new “Cold
  War strategy of containment.” Nor have any of the former US
  presidents or presidential candidates who once advocated
  partnership with post-Soviet Russia. Before the Ukraine crisis
  deepened, a handful of unofficial dissenters did appear on
  mainstream television, radio and op-ed pages, but so few and
  fleetingly they seemed to be heretics awaiting banishment. Their
  voices have since been muted by legions of cold warriors.



  Both sides in the confrontation, the West and Russia, have
  legitimate grievances. Does this mean, however, that the American
  establishment’s account of recent events should not be
  questioned? That it was imposed on the West by Putin’s
  “aggression,” and this because of his desire “to
  re-create as much of the old Soviet empire as he can” or
  merely to “maintain Putin’s domestic rating.” Does it
  mean there is nothing credible enough to discuss in Moscow’s side
  of the story? That twenty years of NATO’s eastward expansion has
  caused Russia to feel cornered. That the Ukraine crisis was
  instigated by the West’s attempt, last November, to smuggle the
  former Soviet republic into NATO. That the West’s jettisoning in
  February of its own agreement with then-President Viktor
  Yanukovych brought to power in Kiev an unelected regime so
  anti-Russian and so uncritically embraced by Washington that the
  Kremlin felt an urgent need to annex predominantly Russian
  Crimea, the home of its most cherished naval base. And, most
  recently, that Kiev’s sending of military units to suppress
  protests in pro-Russian eastern Ukraine is itself a violation of
  the April 17 agreement to de-escalate the crisis.



  Future historians will certainly find some merit in Moscow’s
  arguments, and wonder why they are being widely debated in, for
  example, Germany, but not in America. It may already be too late
  for the democratic debate the US elite owes our nation. If so,
  the costs to American democracy are already clear.

Future historians will note that in April 2014, nearly a quarter-century after the end of the Soviet Union, the White House declared a new Cold War on Russia.


  And that, in a grave failure of representative democracy, there
  was scarcely a public word of debate, much less opposition, from
  the American political or media establishment.



  The Obama administration announced its Cold War indirectly, in a
  front-page New York Times story by Peter Baker on April 20.
  According to the report, President Obama has resolved, because of
  the Ukraine crisis, that he can “never have a constructive
  relationship” with Russian President Vladimir Putin and will
  instead “ignore the master of the Kremlin” and focus on
  “isolating…Russia by cutting off its economic and political
  ties to the outside world…effectively making it a pariah
  state.” In short, Baker reports, the White House has adopted
  “an updated version of the Cold War strategy of
  containment.” He might have added, a very extreme version.
  The report has been neither denied nor qualified by the White
  House.



  No modern precedent exists for the shameful complicity of the
  American political-media elite at this fateful turning point.
  Considerable congressional and mainstream media debate, even
  protest, were voiced, for example, during the run-up to the US
  wars in Vietnam and Iraq and, more recently, proposed wars
  against Iran and Syria. This Cold War—its epicenter on Russia’s
  borders; undertaken amid inflammatory American, Russian and
  Ukrainian media misinformation; and unfolding without the
  stabilizing practices that prevented disasters during the
  preceding Cold War—may be even more perilous. It will almost
  certainly result in a new nuclear arms race, a prospect made
  worse by Obama’s provocative public assertion that “our
  conventional forces are significantly superior to the
  Russians’,” and possibly an actual war with Russia triggered
  by Ukraine’s looming civil war. (NATO and Russian forces are
  already mobilizing on the country’s western and eastern borders,
  while the US-backed Kiev government is warning of a “third
  world war.”)



  And yet, all this has come with the virtually unanimous,
  bipartisan support, or indifference, of the US political
  establishment, from left to right, Democrats and Republicans,
  progressives (whose domestic programs will be gravely endangered)
  and conservatives. It has also been supported by mainstream media
  that shape and reflect policy-making opinion, from the Times and
  The Washington Post to The Wall Street Journal, from The New
  Republic to The Weekly Standard, from MSNBC to Fox News, from NPR
  to commercial radio news. (There are notable exceptions,
  including this magazine, but none close enough to the mainstream
  to be “authoritative” inside the Beltway.)



  To be more specific, not one of the 535 members of Congress has
  publicly expressed doubts about the White House’s new “Cold
  War strategy of containment.” Nor have any of the former US
  presidents or presidential candidates who once advocated
  partnership with post-Soviet Russia. Before the Ukraine crisis
  deepened, a handful of unofficial dissenters did appear on
  mainstream television, radio and op-ed pages, but so few and
  fleetingly they seemed to be heretics awaiting banishment. Their
  voices have since been muted by legions of cold warriors.



  Both sides in the confrontation, the West and Russia, have
  legitimate grievances. Does this mean, however, that the American
  establishment’s account of recent events should not be
  questioned? That it was imposed on the West by Putin’s
  “aggression,” and this because of his desire “to
  re-create as much of the old Soviet empire as he can” or
  merely to “maintain Putin’s domestic rating.” Does it
  mean there is nothing credible enough to discuss in Moscow’s side
  of the story? That twenty years of NATO’s eastward expansion has
  caused Russia to feel cornered. That the Ukraine crisis was
  instigated by the West’s attempt, last November, to smuggle the
  former Soviet republic into NATO. That the West’s jettisoning in
  February of its own agreement with then-President Viktor
  Yanukovych brought to power in Kiev an unelected regime so
  anti-Russian and so uncritically embraced by Washington that the
  Kremlin felt an urgent need to annex predominantly Russian
  Crimea, the home of its most cherished naval base. And, most
  recently, that Kiev’s sending of military units to suppress
  protests in pro-Russian eastern Ukraine is itself a violation of
  the April 17 agreement to de-escalate the crisis.

  arguments, and wonder why they are being widely debated in, for
  example, Germany, but not in America. It may already be too late
  for the democratic debate the US elite owes our nation. If so,

Japan would like to continue political dialogue with the Russian Federation, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told Japanese journalists on Wednesday during his visit to Denmark.

“We would like to keep holding political dialogue with Russia in future,” Kishida said but refused to comment on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s reaction to the imposition of new sanctions against Russia by Japan on Tuesday.

The Japanese government yesterday announced additional sanctions against Russia over the situation around Ukraine, where the situation is far from stable after a coup occurred in the country in February. The sanctions envision suspension of entry visa issuance to 23 Russian officials and other persons. The list is to be made public later.

In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry called Tokyo’s decision on sanctions counterproductive and pledged it will not be left without a response.

“Tokyo’s decision to impose visa sanctions on a number of Russian nationals was perceived in Moscow with disappointment and will certainly not be left without a response,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said in this connection.

“This clumsy step was apparently made under external pressure and goes out of line with Tokyo’s statements on the importance of development of the entire complex of relations with Russia,” Lukashevich said.

Meanwhile, Kishida today held phone talks with European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton, during which the sides agreed to overwhelmingly support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), whose observers will monitor early presidential elections in Ukraine scheduled for May 25.

Western countries have imposed targeted sanctions on some Russian and Crimean officials following Crimea’s reunification with Russia in March. Moscow has also imposed some targeted sanctions in response.

The West has already expanded its punitive measures against Russia since they were first imposed and has threatened Russia with new economic sanctions unless Moscow changes its foreign policy. Moscow has said the language of sanctions is counterproductive and will have a boomerang effect on Western nations.

The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, a city with a special status on the Crimean Peninsula, where most residents are Russians, struck agreements to reunify with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation.

The developments followed the coup in Ukraine in February, when new people were propelled to power in the country amid deadly riots as President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns.

Crimea refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities. Russia does not accept the new Ukrainian leaders, who appear unable to restrain radicals and ultranationalists, either.

After Crimea’s incorporation by Russia, which Kiev and Western countries do not recognize despite Russia’s repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite conformed to the international law and the UN Charter and was in line with the precedent set by Kosovo’s secession from Serbia in 2008, protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeastern regions.

Demonstrators, who are demanding referendums on the country’s federalization, took control of some government buildings.

Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim head of state Alexander Turchinov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region in eastern Ukraine, apparently designed to clamp down on federalization supporters.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday dismissed claims that Russia was involved in the latest pro-federalization protests in Ukraine.

“People say our special forces are present there [in Ukraine], say we have sent instructors there. Let me say in all responsibility that there are no Russian instructors, special forces or troops of any kind there. We have no one there,” Putin said in the Belarusian capital Minsk, where he went for integration talks with the leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan.","TOKYO, April 30 /ITAR-TASS/.

The White House published a long-awaited report on the collection of big data Thursday and, while it mentioned the positive side of data collection, the Obama administration also made a number of recommendations to ensure Americans' safety is protected.


  The findings come after a January promise from President Obama
  that the administration would investigate just how much
  rapidly-advancing technology is impacting American society, and
  how those developments affect individuals.



  Some possible upsides from big data in the future presented by
  the report are encouraging. It concluded that
  collection efforts could ultimately help cure diseases,
  discourage criminals, make businesses more efficient, cut waste
  in the federal government, and enhance the education system for
  young people.



  Big data – an all-encompassing term that references the
  always-growing volume and comprehensiveness of information – is
  proof that a free internet is essential to society, the report
  found. Yet the potential hazards might be as worrisome as the
  benefits.



  When former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden
  leaked classified documents revealing extensive surveillance
  efforts both at home in America and abroad, international
  internet users quickly learned that the data they sent so
  willingly was in fact being watched.



  Partly inspired by the backlash, Obama picked senior White House
  adviser John Podesta to lead the study group – including the
  commerce secretary, energy secretary, science adviser, and
  economic adviser – which also consulted academics, privacy
  advocates, technology executives, and civil rights groups.



  Thursday’s report included six recommendations, most of which
  address lingering privacy concerns: advance the Consumer Privacy
  Bill of Rights, pass national data breach legislation, extend
  privacy protection to non-US persons, ensure data collected on
  students in schools is used for educational purposes, extend
  technical expertise to stop discrimination, and amend the
  electronic communications privacy act.



  “Consumers deserve clear, understandable, reasonable
  standards for how their personal information is used in the big
  data era,” the first recommendation stated. “We
  recommend the department of Commerce take appropriate
  consultative steps to seek stakeholder and public comment on what
  changes, if any, are needed to the Consumer Privacy Bill of
  Rights, first proposed by the president in 2012.”



  The report contains only a single passing reference to the
  Snowden leak during an explanation of security breach, instead
  focusing on the collection practices of Google, Facebook, and
  other online giants.



  “It was our task to look at these other sectors,”
  Podesta told the Washington Post, adding that “it’s in no way
  hypocritical” for the administration not to address the NSA
  dragnet.



  Privacy advocates reveled in the report’s suggestion to amend the
  Electronic Communications Privacy Act “to ensure the standard
  of protection for online, digital content is consistent with that
  afforded in the physical world.”



  “The report lays the groundwork for keeping everyone’s
  emails, texts and photos private and secure,” Christopher
  Calabrese, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties
  Union, told USA Today. “Now Congress and the

Former United States congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul has called on the US to stay out of the intensifying Ukraine conflict, saying it was Western powers that initially stirred unrest there and which continue to incite the tense situation.


  On the brink of what he calls a “civil war,” Ukraine
  must be allowed to resolve its differences free of Western forces
  antagonizing and incentivizing further clashes, Paul said,
  especially in the nation’s east where pro-Russian Ukrainians are
  moving to protect the area from the Western-backed government in
  Kiev.


“Western Ukraine right now is being urged on by its Western
  supporters, meaning its NATO supporters, the European Union, the
  United States and the IMF (International Monetary Fund),”
  Paul wrote on his website, ronpaulchannel.com.



  Paul said the US and its allies provoked the Ukrainian conflict
  in the first place, despite what American media outlets and
  Western leaders claim about Russia’s culpability.


“The truth is, the coup of several weeks ago to overthrow the
  elected leader Viktor Yanukovych was stirred up by the same
  group: NATO, the European Union, the U.S., and the IMF,” he
  wrote.



  Paul said that Washington's role in pumping $5 billion into the
  effort to “control Ukraine” is plain interventionism and
  meddling which could easily result in disaster.


“The current fighting looks like a serious escalation that
  may get out of control, even though it’s in the interest on both
  sides, the West as well as Russia, not to escalate,” he
  wrote. “There have been a lot of threats and intimidation on
  sanctions and economic penalties, which very well could get out
  of control.”


  He adds that the IMF has dangled $17 billion in front of the Kiev
  government if it can rid eastern Ukrainian cities of “Russian
  supporters.” These kinds of measures, Paul said, explain
  “more aggressive activity by the Western Ukrainians to try to
  conquer these cities” and show that Western powers do not
  have the Ukrainian people’s best interests at heart.


“Ironically, the IMF doesn’t seem to have much common sense
  in trying to help the Ukrainian people because, in order to get
  this $17 billion, not only must they fight and control the East,
  they also have to raise taxes and increase oil prices—which will
  not help the people,” he wrote. “This is generally the
  case when there are sanctions placed on a country, or when war
  breaks out: the people suffer and the special interests seem to
  thrive.”


  Paul said that the western Ukrainian move to institute a military
  draft also proves it is not on the defensive against Russian
  incursion, as the US and its allies claim.


“In all seriousness, if a country is defending itself, then
  the people rally and you don’t have to use conscription to get
  fighters.”


  Paul concluded by saying the US has helped create and exacerbate
  divisions in Ukraine, and that Washington needs to refrain from
  offering money and weapons or picking sides, and let Ukraine
  “settle this on their own.”

“It would be much better for the Ukrainians, for the
  Europeans, for the Russians, and for the Americans, for us to

We have an agreement with the OSCE and agreed to not give further details at the moment, he said.

The US has been behind the Ukrainian crisis from the beginning, but was initially flying low, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. He added that if sanctions continue, Russia will have to reconsider who has access to key sectors of its economy.

“I think what is happening now shows us who really was
  mastering the process from the beginning. But in the beginning,
  the United States preferred to remain in the shadow,” Putin
  said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.



  Putin stated that since the US has taken a lead role in resolving
  the political crisis in Ukraine, it is “telling that they
  originally were behind this process, but now they just have
  emerged as leaders” of it.



  The Maidan cookies policy paves the way to a broader
  crisis, Putin warned, referring to US officials showing up in
  central Kiev and encouraging protesters during demonstrations.


“It is necessary to understand that the situation is serious
  and try to find serious approaches to the solution,” he
  said.



  Putin said that he has called on Kiev to start an all-Ukrainian
  dialogue, adding that other countries should not be blamed for
  the crisis.


“[They should] treat equally the rights of those living in
  other areas of Ukraine, first of all, I mean, the east and
  southeast, establish a dialogue, find a compromise, he told
  journalists while speaking about the measures necessary to put an
  end to the crisis. “Here's what you need to do; searching for
  the guilty outside Ukraine is wrong.”


  Russia may reconsider foreign access to energy sector



  Regarding the last row of sanctions imposed on Russia by the US
  and the EU, Vladimir Putin said he sees no need for counter
  sanctions.


We would very much wish not to resort to any measures in
  response, he told reporters. But if something like
  that continues, we will of course have to think about who is
  working in the key sectors of the Russian economy, including the
  energy sector, and how.”


  Certain US companies have close business ties to Russia,
  including Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp.



  For example, Exxon Mobil's net acreage holdings in Sakhalin,
  Russia were about 85,000 acres at the end of 2013, while its net
  acreage in the Rosneft joint venture for the Kara and Black Seas
  was 11.3 million acres.



  Chevron Corp has a 15 percent stake in the Caspian Pipeline
  Consortium, which transports crude oil from Kazakhstan through
  Russia to the Black Sea.



  On Monday, the US implemented its latest round of sanctions against Russia, targeting business
  leaders and companies with ties to Putin.


Regarding the second package, it's not clear at all what
  this is linked to, because there is no cause and effect link with
  what is happening now in Ukraine and Russia, Putin said.



  At the same time, the US and EU sanctions will not harm the
  Eurasian integration process, which is meant to lead to the
  creation of the Eurasian Economic Union, based on a Customs Union
  and common economic space among Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus,
  he said.



  Putin also commented on observers from the Organization for Security
  and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) being detained in eastern
  Ukraine, stating that he is confident that the situation will be
  resolved, but stressing that all parties involved must draw
  conclusions.


“All the participants in this process will have to draw
  conclusions from this, from this situation. And from now on avoid
  such mistakes,” he said.



  Putin noted that he understands the concerns of European partners
  and added that Ukrainian authorities should have discussed and
  received approval for the visit from local authorities in eastern
  Ukraine in order to avoid such a situation.","Putin: Washington behind Ukraine events all along, though flying low

Regrettably, the ongoing events have fully confirmed this assessment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, as Ukrainian forces tried to retake government buildings occupied by pro-Russia activists.

He also urged the United States and Europe to assess the situation objectively and call upon those using military aircraft against populated areas to rethink, according to the state RIA Novosti news agency.

Russia's foreign ministry repeated in a statement that using the army against its own people is a crime and will lead Ukraine to a catastrophe.

Ukraine launched a major attack against pro-Russian forces around the city of Slaviansk in the early hours of Friday. Rebels shot down two Ukrainian helicopters and killed one crewmember, according to the leader of Slaviansk's self-defense forces Vyacheslav Ponomaryov.

Ponomaryov accused the Ukrainian authorities of launching the attack using heavy weapons, saying the self-defense forces had to withdraw into the city.

Ukrainian defense ministry confirmed the loss of the two helicopters, but said two crewmembers were killed.

It added the helicopters were shot down with a surface-to-air missile, which proved the rebels were not civilians but well-equipped and well-trained military.

Ukraine Interior Minister Arsen Avakov warned Slaviansk residents to remain indoors while anti-terrorism operations proceeded in the city.

The ruling means the second trial of Alexei Navalny, who is serving a five-year suspended sentence on a 2013 theft, will be put off until prosecutors remove flaws in their case.

He and his brother Oleg, who is also charged, deny guilt.

Putting off the trial removes a cause for protests in Russia and for Western criticism at a time when Moscow's relations with the United States and European Union are badly strained over the turmoil in Ukraine and Russia's annexation of the Crimea region last month.

The judge's ruling granting Navalny's motion to return the case to prosecutors came at a preliminary hearing on the same day that the United States imposed new sanctions on several Russian officials and companies close to Putin over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.

"http://en.ria.ru/world/20140428/189421661/US-Europe-Divided-Over-Anti-Russia-Sanctions.html","RIA","Mon- 28 Apr 2014 11-29-18 +0400","US, Europe Divided Over Anti-Russia Sanctions","US, Europe Divided Over Anti-Russia SanctionsWASHINGTON, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – As the United States seeks to slap tougher economic sanctions on Russia, it has found itself mired in a debate with the wary European Union on how to show Russia a united front, the New York Times reported Monday.

The issue of a coordinated effort came to a head last week when the EU, who has more at stake economically, reared against the US sanctions plan on Friday, forcing Washington to put it off until Monday.

Brussels fears that more economic sanctions, used by the US to try and drive a wedge in the Russian economy, will hit the EU much harder than the US. In 2012, the trade turnover between Russia and Europe amounted to 370 billion dollars, compared to only 26 billion between the US and Russia.

US President Obama has been reluctant to get too far ahead of European partners in his drive for more pressure on Russia, unlike some officials who said that waiting on Europe was a recipe for inaction.

“The notion that for us to go forward with sectoral sanctions on our own without the Europeans would be the most effective deterrent to Mr. Putin, I think, is factually wrong,” Mr. Obama said at a press conference during his Asia trip.

“We’re going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified,” he added.

Obama was backed in his cautious approach by US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew who called for a more balanced sanctions plan, saying that more action on the part of America without sufficient EU backing meant the US interests would be hurt without having the desired impact on Moscow.

The newest round of sanctions may put blocks on four of Russia’s biggest commercial banks, as well as on executive directors of its two energy giants, the gas major Gasprom and the oil-trading Rosneft.

Moscow has repeatedly criticized Washington for using the “language of sanctions” against Russia, saying the move was counterproductive and mutually destructive.","WASHINGTON, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – As the United States seeks to slap tougher economic sanctions on Russia, it has found itself mired in a debate with the wary European Union on how to show Russia a united front, the New York Times reported Monday.

The issue of a coordinated effort came to a head last week when the EU, who has more at stake economically, reared against the US sanctions plan on Friday, forcing Washington to put it off until Monday.

Brussels fears that more economic sanctions, used by the US to try and drive a wedge in the Russian economy, will hit the EU much harder than the US. In 2012, the trade turnover between Russia and Europe amounted to 370 billion dollars, compared to only 26 billion between the US and Russia.

US President Obama has been reluctant to get too far ahead of European partners in his drive for more pressure on Russia, unlike some officials who said that waiting on Europe was a recipe for inaction.

“The notion that for us to go forward with sectoral sanctions on our own without the Europeans would be the most effective deterrent to Mr. Putin, I think, is factually wrong,” Mr. Obama said at a press conference during his Asia trip.

“We’re going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified,” he added.

“Therefore Ukraine cannot guarantee the supply of gas to European consumers, that is, its transit in the amount that is provided for in the contracts between Gazprom and European consumers,” the Russian minister said.

“This is very disturbing information and we think this is unacceptable. Urgent measures must be taken by both Ukraine and our European partners who are also an interested party and bear just as much responsibility for the transit of sufficient volumes of gas across Ukraine,” Novak said.

“We think the situation is becoming critical and urgent measures must be taken to resolve it,” he added.

According to Novak, at least 18.5 billion cubic meters of gas need to be held in underground gas storage facilities in wintertime. “Our estimates indicate that there are about 4-6 billion cubic metres of gas there now. This means that about 12 billion cubic meters of gas have to be pumped into the underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine from May to September. That’s a rather large amount,” he said.

Prodan said earlier that the Ukrainian gas transit system would be incorporated into the European gas transportation system. “We can also use the possibilities of our underground gas storage facilities and hope that European gas companies will build up their reserves in our storage facilities,” he said.

The throughput capacity of the Ukrainian gas transportation is 288 billion cubic metres system at the entrance and 178.5 billion cubic meters at the exit, including 142.5 billion cubic metres to European countries and 3.5 billion cubic metres to Moldova. Natural gas transit through Ukraine to Europe and CIS countries in 2011 increased by 5.7% from 2010 to 104.197.067.000 cubic metres, including to Western Europe by 5.9% to 101.098.013.000 cubic metres, but decreased by 2.4% to 3.099.054,000 cubic metres to CIS countries.

Ukraine’s gas transportation system consists of 72 compressor stations, 110 production shops and 1.451 gas distribution stations. The overall length of gas pipelines operated by the company is 38.600 kilometres, including 22.200 kilometres of trunk pipelines and 16.400 kilometres of extensions.","At trilateral consultations in Warsaw on May 2, Ukrainian Energy and Coal Industry Minister Yuriy Prodan said his country could not guarantee the storage of necessary amounts of gas during summer for further transit to Europe.

The US had set their eyes on the idea to make Ukraine the 29th EU state or perhaps even the 52nd US state, though it doesn’t have any clear scenario and simply continues blamestorming Russia, global financial markets expert Patrick Young told RT.

RT:President Obama says Russia's done
  nothing to meet its Geneva pledges. However, it’s likely to be
  more applicable to the US itself. Why is Washington acting like
  this?

Patrick Young: I think the State Department is
  probably under great stress at the moment. Of course we’ve seen
  President Obama, in the course of the last three or four days,
  doing shuttle diplomacy through South-East Asia. This was
  supposed to be an incredible ceremonial tour where he would sign
  multiple free trade agreements, including with Japan. Instead he
  ended up to play football with robots in Tokyo. Why? Because
  ultimately his trade agenda is failing as it goes along.
  Therefore, given the poor quality of negotiation skills by the
  US, it’s hardly surprising that they are trying to do anything to
  take away the news. And therefore, we see Mr. Obama once again
  being a puppet ministered by the neo-cons that are still behind
  him, as an administration who simply see everything as being bad
  in Russia. It’s quite clear from what Mr. Lavrov has said, and
  has been saying, that he is trying everything to encourage people
  to disarm and therefore, active attempts to try to diffuse the
  Ukrainian situation.


RT:What is the American policy aimed at?
  Does the United States actually want the two sides in Ukraine to
  reach a deal?

PY: I think it’s very worrying because certainly
  the US seems to have had a remarkable transition in Ukraine. It
  seemed to be absolutely fine when you wanted to mount barricades
  in Maidan and there were people like John McCain to speak to
  them. Not only we have got this very fractured situation in
  Eastern Ukraine about which the Russians had previously warned
  us. Ultimately we have got a singular failure of diplomacy but
  particularly from the Western side at the moment. And of course
  what is happening, President Obama is rushing off to this mantra
  of claiming that he wants even greater sanctions.


RT:What does the United States expect of
  Russia, then? It can't send in its military to disarm the
  pro-Russian protesters in Ukraine. It's asked them to disarm,
  what more can it do?

PY: Personally I’m confused because let’s put it
  another way. If Russia sent in troops to forcibly disarm the
  people who are holding the buildings, then America would claim
  they are invading. I really don’t know. The American picture is
  not clear. The Foreign Secretary Mr. Kerry perennially, as we
  know from his election campaign for president, has always been
  one peppermint tea short of a full bag of coffee when he is at
  the diner. Ultimately it’s a huge problem in this environment at
  the moment. I don’t think America knows what it wants because
  ultimately America had set their eyes on the idea Ukraine is
  going to be something like the 29th state of the EU or perhaps
  even the 52nd state of the US. None of those were ever going to
  come to pass, the money is not there from the US and Europe to
  support whether it’s the rump Ukraine or whichever part of
  Ukraine it is. It’s confusing. America is not clear and simply
  blamestorming Russia is not going to help the
  situation.


RT:Neither Kiev nor the protesters seem to
  have stuck to the Geneva accord. Are they each waiting for the
  other side to act first?

PY: The problem we have here is a huge loss of
  faith on all parts. America clearly doesn’t trust Russia, at the
  same time there is a huge number of people on the ground in
  Ukraine who’ve been simply left behind. We are not talking about
  particularly the Eastern Ukrainians who have actually invaded
  these buildings, those occupying groups are one thing. But
  actually let’s face it: Ukraine is being run by a
  non-democratically appointed government that seems to have the
  blessing of the US. It’s not democratic, there are democratic
  elections supposedly taking place at the moment but as we can
  see, all the great powers are in there trying to shuffle things
  for their influence. It looks very 19th century in the way the
  things are going on at the moment.


RT:Why can’t the sides of the conflict
  reach any compromise? Or why the US doesn’t want to negotiate
  with Russia at least?

PY: Unfortunately, it is very difficult and this
  is a situation because after all as we know President Yanukovich,
  who was deeply flawed in his ability to govern, but was
  nonetheless the democratically elected president, ultimately had
  to flee the day after we had a group of Western politicians
  telling us that they had come to a wondrous solution in Kiev.
  Therefore, when there are challenges over the whole issue, it
  really requires leadership and statesmanship. The terrible
  problem is that Mr. Obama and Mr. Kerry repeatedly fail to have
  those abilities that they demonstrate. Let’s put it another way.
  Today we are celebrating in Poland the canonization of Pope John
  Paul II, there was leader and he stood on the world stage at the
  time we had Mrs. Thatcher, Ronald Reagan – they may have been the
  absolute enemies of the old Soviet system but they were people
  who could do business with and did business with Mr. Gorbachev at

Lukyanchenko said however that legislative duplicities could be avoided if the referendum were synchronized with the presidential election.

“It would then be held under the supervision of numerous international organizations and anyone would scarcely question its legitimacy then,” he said. “In addition, we could avoid unnecessary excessive costs then.”

“To hold the referendum, a total of 426 polling stations should be set up just the same number of electoral commissions, Lukyanchenko said.

Earlier, he proposed to hold an all-Ukraine voting on a new Constitution simultaneously with the election of the president.

“The Americans are not ready to admit that they can’t single-handedly run the show in all corners of the planet from Washington, that they can’t impose their ready decisions on everyone,” he said.

“And they can’t realize — that is, I think they are already beginning to realize but still keep instinctively adhering to the position that they don’t need to take into account the opinions and interests of others,” the Russian foreign minister said.

“You know that in response to a demand to vacate the illegally occupied buildings in Kiev, [US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs] Victoria Nuland said that ‘everything that is still being held by protesters is being held with licenses and with the agreement of the government of Ukraine… or with regular leases from the owners of the building’,” he said.

“It’s just incredible! It’s hard to believe that they may use such arguments seriously,” Lavrov said.

Sergei Lavrov called on the United States on Wednesday to stop thinking exclusively of geopolitical interests when dealing with the Ukraine crisis.

In an interview with RT, Lavrov said Ukraine was only a manifestation of the US unwillingness to make concessions in its geopolitical struggle.

“As I said, the point is not Ukraine. Ukraine is only a manifestation of US unwillingness to retreat in geopolitical struggle,” the Russian foreign minister went on to say.

 

Coup in Ukraine

The situation in Ukraine is far from stable after a coup occurred in the country in February following months of anti-government protests, often violent, triggered by President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the European Union in November 2013 in order to study the deal more thoroughly.

The crisis deepened when Crimea, where most residents are Russians, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the de facto Ukrainian leadership. Crimea reunified with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which it overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation.

After the reunification, which Kiev and Western countries do not accept despite Russia’s repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law, protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeastern territories, with demonstrators taking control of some government buildings and demanding referendums on the country’s federalization.

The Right Sector far-right ultranationalist Ukrainian group is still active despite agreements reached in Geneva last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday.

“However, on the next day, [Ukrainian parliament-appointed acting president Alexander] Turchynov ordered the army to shoot at unarmed people taking part in peaceful protests. In Geneva, [we] also agreed on disarmament of extremists, but the Right Sector is still rather active,” he said.

The Geneva Statement, adopted after last Thursday’s meeting on Ukraine that involved Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine, in particular envisions that all illegal armed formations should be disarmed in Ukraine, all administrative buildings unblocked and all protesters except for those who committed serious crimes pardoned.

“The new regime should start releasing political prisoners and implementing the agreements reached on February 21, which require, among other things, the surrender of illegal held arms. The authorities must disarm the Right Sector and they must stop making empty promises that all regions will be engaged in the constitutional reform,” Lavrov said in an interview with the Russia Today television channel on Wednesday, April 23.

He noted that the purpose of the agreement signed by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the opposition on February 21 was to “make Yanukovych assume an obligation not to use police and not to declare a state of emergency”.

“We can say that it was a capitulation. Everything he promised was done. Some say that he did not sign a law restoring the previous constitution, but this law entered into force anyway. Therefore all of the opposition’s demands were met,” Lavrov said, adding that the opposition failed to keep its word.

The purpose of the Geneva agreement of April 17 was to “try to put the process back on track, including constitutional reform that will engage all regions on an equal basis”. Unfortunately, the agreement “has not been implemented by those who must take the first step”, the minister said.

The Pentagon chief, in a speech on the future of the 28-nation alliance, said Russia's seizure of the Crimean peninsula and other actions reminded NATO of its founding purpose and presented a clarifying moment for the transatlantic alliance.

NATO must stand ready to revisit the basic principles underlying its relationship with Russia, Hagel said in remarks at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington.

He also raised a longstanding U.S. concern about NATO defense spending, noting that American outlays on security are three times that of the other 27 partners combined, even though the U.S. gross domestic product is smaller than their total GDP.

This lopsided burden threatens NATO's integrity, cohesion and capability - and ultimately, both European and transatlantic security, Hagel said at the think tank. We must see renewed financial commitments from all NATO members.

Only four of the NATO partners met their agreed target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense in 2013 - Estonia, Greece, Britain and the United States. France and Turkey fell just shy of the 2 percent goal.

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said later Hagel was talking not just about pouring more money into defense but about better coordinating spending with the allies to avoid duplication so that taxpayer money is used in wise, efficient ways.

We want to make (spending decisions) in concert with our partners because some of them have capabilities that, frankly, we don't have or that they can develop in ways we can't develop or shouldn't have to develop, Kirby said.

Hagel said a big obstacle to defense investment among the Western allies was that many people believe the end of the Cold War has eased the risk of conflict among nations.

Russia's actions in Ukraine shatter that myth and usher in bracing new realities, he said. Given Moscow's actions in Ukraine, NATO in the future should expect Russia to test our alliance's purpose, stamina and commitment, he added.

Hagel's address came amid increased violence between Ukrainian loyalists and Russian separatists despite an international peace deal, and echoed calls by other U.S. officials this week for renewed commitment to NATO.

On Friday, pro-Russian rebels shot down two Ukrainian helicopters, killing two people, as Ukrainian forces tightened their siege of separatist-held Slaviansk.

The United States and European allies have been watching carefully the movements of 40,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine's eastern border and the takeover of buildings in cities in eastern Ukraine by armed pro-Russian militants.

U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday called on Russia to persuade the pro-Russian military groups to stand down, and he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that key sectors of the Russian economy would face sanctions if Moscow disrupts Ukraine's plan to hold elections on May 25.

BOOST MILITARY SPENDING

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday urged NATO allies who are not meeting the 2 percent defense spending benchmark to boost their payments to the alliance in the next five years.

To help meet the goal of increasing defense spending, Hagel called for NATO members' finance ministers or budget officials to attend an alliance meeting to discuss the issue.

Spending imbalances among the NATO partners has been a longstanding complaint of U.S. defense secretaries.

Three years ago, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates used his final speech in Europe as Pentagon chief to warn that NATO members risked collective military irrelevance unless they bore more of the burden and boosted military spending.

His remarks came in the context of the Western-backed 2011 ouster of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's government, which exposed a number of weaknesses among the European partners' militaries, such as a lack of intelligence and reconnaissance aircraft and specialists needed to identify bombing targets.

Germany’s government did a silly and highly unprofessional thing as it sent a group of Bundeswehr experts to Ukraine upon an arrangement with the Kiev authorities, Alexander Neu, a deputy of Bundestag representing the Left Party said Sunday at a meeting of the parliamentary committee on defense.

He believes an agreement on “a verification operation”, or on the sending of military specialists to the east of Ukraine that was reached by Berlin and Kiev, is doing an obvious disservice to the properly diplomatic observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that is currently doing its job in Ukraine.

Charges of espionage that have been issued to the group by the pro-Russian activists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk cannot be dismissed altogether as a minimum and, in addition to it, a question arises on why the detained officers are traveling the east of Ukraine precisely at this moment, Neu said.

The group that supposedly includes three German military experts, a translator and observers from Denmark, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Sweden, one person from each country, arrived in Ukraine under the cover of the OSCE at the invitation of Ukrainian government. It was arrested by people’s self-defense forces near the eastern town of Slavyansk Friday, with the city officials saying the group had been engaging in espionage.

On Sunday, Bundeswehr Colonel Alex Schneider, one of the group’s members, appeared at a news conference in Slavyansk to tell the reporters that he and other members of the group were getting fair and friendly treatment from their detainers in the rebellious East-Ukrainian city, where the population is demanding a referendum on the future status of the Donbass Coalfields area and Ukraine’s changeover to a federated state structure.

Col Schneider said the military experts making up the group were in good health and no one had done physical harm to them after their detention. He added he did not known when their release might take place.

He said members of the group had spoken much to the people who had been guarding them since their arrival in Slavyansk and they had learned much about how the situation was affecting the locals’ families and how the current situation was exerting impact on people’s lives.

Col Schneider also said the group members had been stunned upon seeing the level of impoverishment of the local people.

The head of a prominent Russian think tank is battling it out on the pages of the Washington Post over what he calls “disturbing” views attributed to him regarding the historical nature of Hitler’s Nazi regime and recent events that transpired in Crimea.


  The whole firestorm erupted over an article written by Andranik
  Migranyan, who heads up the New York office of the Institute for
  Democracy and Cooperation, for Izvesti earlier this month.



  Dismissing critics who had likened Russian President Vladimir
  Putin to the notorious Nazi leader, Migranyan said:
  “One must distinguish between Hitler before 1939 and Hitler
  after 1939. The thing is that Hitler collected [German] lands. If
  he had become famous only for uniting without a drop of blood
  Germany with Austria, Sudetenland and Memel, in fact completing
  what Bismarck failed to do, and if he had stopped there, then he
  would have remained a politician of the highest class.


  Several weeks later, Washington Post opinion writer Richard Cohen
  pounced on Migranyan’s position and its
  “chilling content.”

“If something like this is what Putin has in mind — gathering
  Russian-speaking people under his rule — then Migranyan seems to
  be saying: What’s the big deal? What he does not mention, though,
  is that by 1939 Hitler was already engaged in killing Jews,
  dissidents, communists, homosexuals and, that year, the mentally
  and physically feeble…For anyone, least of all a think-tank
  director, to overlook this record is frightening.”


  On Saturday, Migranyan replied to Cohen in the Post, expressing his
  surprise at the views which had been attributed to him.


“Notwithstanding Mr. Cohen’s assertions, I am well aware of
  Adolf Hitler’s perverted ideology and horrific crimes. In the
  article Mr. Cohen cited, I wrote that Hitler ‘became known as one
  of the greatest evildoers in history because he set before
  himself and Germany’s people the delusional idea of world
  domination, proclaimed entire peoples to be inferior, tried to
  establish the superiority of the Aryan race over other, less
  worthy races and made it his goal to exterminate tens of millions
  of Slavs, Jews, Gypsies and other ethnicities,” he said.


“It is precisely these delusional ideas that led to Hitler’s
  and all Germans’ dismal end.’ The central point of my article was
  that Hitler’s unique evil made it inappropriate to compare his
  actions to what happened in Crimea. Mr. Cohen’s column did not
  reflect my views.”


  Noting how his own family suffered as a result of the Nazi
  invasion of the Soviet Union, Migranyan said he will “always
  reject Hitler and his methods.”","Hitler parallel debate rages in Washington Post

The head of a prominent Russian think tank is battling it out on the pages of the Washington Post over what he calls “disturbing” views attributed to him regarding the historical nature of Hitler’s Nazi regime and recent events that transpired in Crimea.


  The whole firestorm erupted over an article written by Andranik
  Migranyan, who heads up the New York office of the Institute for
  Democracy and Cooperation, for Izvesti earlier this month.



  Dismissing critics who had likened Russian President Vladimir
  Putin to the notorious Nazi leader, Migranyan said:
  “One must distinguish between Hitler before 1939 and Hitler
  after 1939. The thing is that Hitler collected [German] lands. If
  he had become famous only for uniting without a drop of blood
  Germany with Austria, Sudetenland and Memel, in fact completing
  what Bismarck failed to do, and if he had stopped there, then he
  would have remained a politician of the highest class.


  Several weeks later, Washington Post opinion writer Richard Cohen
  pounced on Migranyan’s position and its
  “chilling content.”

“If something like this is what Putin has in mind — gathering
  Russian-speaking people under his rule — then Migranyan seems to
  be saying: What’s the big deal? What he does not mention, though,
  is that by 1939 Hitler was already engaged in killing Jews,
  dissidents, communists, homosexuals and, that year, the mentally
  and physically feeble…For anyone, least of all a think-tank
  director, to overlook this record is frightening.”


  On Saturday, Migranyan replied to Cohen in the Post, expressing his
  surprise at the views which had been attributed to him.


“Notwithstanding Mr. Cohen’s assertions, I am well aware of
  Adolf Hitler’s perverted ideology and horrific crimes. In the
  article Mr. Cohen cited, I wrote that Hitler ‘became known as one
  of the greatest evildoers in history because he set before
  himself and Germany’s people the delusional idea of world
  domination, proclaimed entire peoples to be inferior, tried to
  establish the superiority of the Aryan race over other, less
  worthy races and made it his goal to exterminate tens of millions
  of Slavs, Jews, Gypsies and other ethnicities,” he said.


“It is precisely these delusional ideas that led to Hitler’s
  and all Germans’ dismal end.’ The central point of my article was
  that Hitler’s unique evil made it inappropriate to compare his
  actions to what happened in Crimea. Mr. Cohen’s column did not
  reflect my views.”


  Noting how his own family suffered as a result of the Nazi
  invasion of the Soviet Union, Migranyan said he will “always
  reject Hitler and his methods.”",495

He paid a working visit to Switzerland as a co-chair of the Switzerland-Russia inter-parliamentary friendship group.

“The position of Switzerland is very cautious and is based on an attempt to preserve its neutrality and simultaneously not to break relations with the European Union,” Vorobyov said. “But, nevertheless, Switzerland is showing an example of constructive dialogue and co-operation.”

“Switzerland today is a country in the European Union that demonstrates in the difficult political situation the right approach to the solution of the acute problem,” the FC member added.

The co-chair of the friendship group from the Swiss side, President of the Council of States (upper house) of the parliament of Switzerland Filippo Lombardi for his part expressed the hope for mediator efforts of the confederation, especially in view of the fact that it chairs this year the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). “Switzerland currently presides in the OSCE, and we hope that it will play its decisive role in the current difficult situation,” Lombardi said.

Bern had previously refused to automatically repeat the EU and U.S. sanctions, imposed on Russia in response to its position on Ukraine.

While publicly denying Russia’s accusation that the EU forced Ukraine choose between Russia and Europe, in private America’s top diplomat reportedly admitted this as fact and that it played a part in escalating the ongoing crisis.

“Some folks in Europe made mistakes, the association
  agreement became too much of an East-West tug of war. It
  shouldn’t have been,” US Secretary of State John Kerry
  reportedly said at a private meeting of the Trilateral Commission
  in Washington last Friday. His words were quoted by the Daily
  Beast on Tuesday.



  Russia has long insisted that the EU and the US sparked the
  political crisis in Ukraine last October. The EU Association
  Agreement, which President Viktor Yanukovich refused to sign
  after long deliberation, would require Ukraine to sever or
  downgrade many of its economic ties with Russia, which would hurt
  greatly its economy. Yanukovich’s decision triggered the protest
  in Kiev, which eventually escalated into an armed coup that
  deposed him.



  European and American officials rejected Russia’s view of the
  ill-fated agreement, insisting it would not damage Ukraine’s
  trade with Russia. But apparently in private conversation
  American diplomats don’t follow the narrative.



  The division between the US and the EU over Ukraine was
  highlighted earlier in February after a recording of a phone
  conversation between Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland
  and American Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt was leaked.



  They were discussing the foreign effort to help anti-Yanukovich
  opposition create what has now became the new Ukrainian
  government and expressed frustration at EU’s hesitance on the
  matter, culminated by the infamous “F**k the EU” exclamation from
  Nuland.



  Kerry’s private comment on the EU’s role in the crisis is just a
  small part of the Daily Beast report. The majority was focused on
  the alleged evidence that the US had of Russian agents acting in
  Ukraine to stir up protest. While the website initially implied
  that the evidence had been recorded by US intelligence, the State
  Department later clarified that the reported remarks were related
  to recordings produced by the Ukrainian government.



  Kiev published a six-minute recording, which it said proved the
  presence of Russian secret agents in Ukraine, two weeks ago. This
  was one day after a disastrous attack on protester-held
  Slavyansk, in which then-head of the Anti-Terrorist Center of the
  Ukrainian Security Service was injured. However, the evidence was
  far from conclusively damning for Russia.



  Another package of evidence Ukraine produced so far, which the US
  State Department endorsed, proved to be faulty. The alleged photo
  evidence case quickly collapsed, with the New York Times, which
  headlined it, having to publish a follow-up admitting its failure to properly verify it.



  Following Kerry’s previous remarks on the alleged Russian
  involvement in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
  challenged his counterpart to produce any
  real proof.


“Kerry has many times mentioned that Ukrainian intelligence
  captured Russian agents,” he said. “So, show them to the
  people, have them on TV. Kerry says they don’t want to disclose
  the identities of those people who are engaged in the captures.
  This is not serious.”","Kerry rebuked EU for inciting Ukraine ‘tug of war’– report

The IMF loan to Ukraine is just a sort of band aid to hold it together, while harsh austerity measures will only worsen the situation for the poor Ukrainian people rather than bail out them, editor of Business New Europe Ben Aris, told RT.


  This March the IMF announced that it would give Ukraine up to $18
  billion in order to help the country avoid the default. However,
  the IMF also demands huge economic reforms in return.


RT:Ukraine is certainly in need of money.
  So what's wrong with getting help from the IMF then?

Ben Aris: It’s in desperate need of money. The
  country is virtually bankrupt, it is living from hand to mouth,
  running on fumes, and the IMF has stepped in with a program that
  should be over two years, so they are looking for some $17
  billion this year. However, it comes with strings attached and
  there lies a problem. The balls are now very firmly into the
  government’s court and they need to come up with a reform program
  because when all is said and done they can’t buy their way out of
  crisis, they need to fix the economy and that money is just a
  sort of plaster to hold it together while they are getting on
  with that work. That is going to be extremely difficult, it’s
  hard to express just how sick the Ukrainian economy is; it is one
  of only two countries in the whole fifteen republics of the
  former Soviet Union that has yet to reach its 1991 level. So they
  have everything to do before them and of course doing that in a
  very tense and unstable political situation.


RT:The IMF claims the economic reforms will
  take care of the most vulnerable there, but what actually can
  they do for people in reality?

BA: It’s about putting the economy back on to a
  stable footing and that means getting control of deficits - the
  current account deficit is very high, the budget deficit is very
  high, the economy itself is in a free fall, the government is
  saying it is going to contract by 3 percent, the program
  announced today actually assumes 5 percent and the analysts are
  saying that the contraction could be as severe as 10 percent.
  This is an economy caving in on itself. And in order to do that
  they are going to have to introduce some very harsh austerity. By
  that I mean they are going to cut the public sector, they are
  going to cut wages, they are going to cut what they call an
  overly generous pension, and at the same time they are going to
  have to raise taxes. So the poor Ukrainian people, rather than
  being bailed out by the IMF, are going to be face the sort of
  austerity that the populations of Greece and Cyprus have seen, if
  not even more harsh, even more difficult to pay, and that of
  course will cause problems. The promises that have been made by
  the EU association and IMF bailout have led people to believe
  that once the rest comes to help, then everything is going to get
  better, and actually in the short term it’s going to get a lot
  worse for the average person.


RT:Meanwhile, Transparency International
  ranks Ukraine as a highly corrupt country. Is the IMF worried
  about what might happen to their cash do you think?

BA: This is actually one of the core problems.
  The corruption is a function of the fact that in the last 10
  years no government, neither Blue, nor Orange, has actually
  attempted to even begin the process of building up new
  institutions of the functioning government. So the first thing
  the government is going to have to do is try to put all of these
  pieces together to build the machinery of normal government, and
  that is going to be very difficult. Part and parcel of that is
  stamping out corruption. Transparency called it the most corrupt
  country in eastern Europe and it has similar problems with press
  freedom, human rights… it has the whole gamut of issues to deal
  with. Just now we are turning to the work of rebuilding the
  country, whereas most of the countries of the region have been at
  it for the 10 years.


RT:Where does this leave Moscow? Will it
  help in the future if things go really bad?

BA: One of the ironies is that the first tranche
  is going to be delivered immediately… $3 billion… a large part of
  that is going to end up in Russia’s coffers to pay for gas and
  bond payments. At the end of the day, some of the people in
  Ukraine have intimated that to rescue Ukraine is impossible
  without cooperation and partnership with Russia. Russia remains a
  key trading partner, it also heavily invested into the economy,
  it banks there and main crediting organizations are actually
  still functioning and for Ukraine to prosper and become healthy
  again, it’s inconceivable that they can do it without Russia. At
  the same time we have the European association agreement, but EU
  membership is not on the table, and EU membership would come with
  all the structural reforms that it desperately needs. The
  Ukrainian economy is actually dragging the Russian economy down
  and so it’s in Russian interests to see something done. But
  obviously where we stand for the moment, we have a long way from
  having a three-way conversation between the EU, Kiev and Moscow.

The Kremlin has called absurd the plans to hold presidential elections in Ukraine amid bloodshed, Dmitry Peskov said.

“It is obvious that under the current Constitution, in the conditions of combat actions, a punitive operation and mass killing it is at least absurd to speak about elections,” he stated.

Russia’s Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has urged his Pentagon counterpart Chuck Hagel to help cool down the rhetoric over Ukraine and described NATO troops massing near Russian borders as “unprecedented.”


  Speaking to Hagel by phone on Monday, Shoigu also denied the
  accusations that there are Russian agents acting in Ukraine.


“The Russian minister has called for his colleague to help
  cool down the rhetoric [over Ukraine] as much as possible. He
  also unequivocally refuted baseless accusations that there are
  Russian sabotage and spy teams, purportedly destabilizing the
  situation in the south-east of the country,” said a
  statement from the Russian defense ministry.



  Instead, Shoigu classed the growth of NATO activity in Eastern
  Europe as “unprecedented”, saying it was accompanied by
  “provocative” rhetoric about “containing”
  Russia.



  According to the Russian statement, Hagel expressed “extreme
  concern” about the situation in Ukraine on behalf of
  Brussels and Washington, and said that NATO’s actions in Europe
  intend to demonstrate the unity and defensive capability of the
  alliance, and have “no provocative or expansive aims”.


  “There is nothing new for Russia in all of this,” Hagel,
  who assumed the role of Secretary of Defense last year, told
  Shoigu.



  The Russian minister defended Moscow’s decision to announce
  military exercises near the Ukrainian border last week.



  “As soon as the Ukrainian authorities said that they were not
  going to use regular troops against unarmed civilians, Russian
  units were re-stationed in their usual bases,” said Shoigu.



  Shoigu accused Kiev of deploying more than 15,000 personnel, 80
  tanks, 130 armored vehicles, and 60 artillery guns in the east of
  the country, “under the pretext of ‘fighting
  terrorism’.”


  On Monday, NATO continued to increase its presence in the Baltic regions as UK
  and France deployed eight fighter jets to Lithuania and Poland to
  strengthen NATO air defense amid rising tensions in Ukraine,
  according to officials.



  Out of the eight planes, four UK Typhoon jets touched down in
  Lithuania and another four French Rafale jets landed in Poland’s
  northeast town of Malbork, UK and French defense ministries
  stated.



  The additional jets in the area are to “provide reassurance
  to our NATO allies in eastern Europe and the Baltic states,”
  British Defense Minister Philip Hammond said. In the wake of
  recent events in Ukraine, it is right that NATO takes steps to
  reaffirm very publicly its commitment to the collective security
  of its members, he added.","Moscow calls US, NATO military buildup near Russian borders ‘unprecedented’

Russia celebrates Day of Russian Parliamentarism on Sunday, April 27, 2014. The memorable date was instituted by the June 27 2012 federal law introducing amendments in Article 1.1 of the federal law on days of military glory and memorable dates in Russia. The first Russian State Duma started working on this day in 1906.

Last Russian Emperor Nicholas II issued a manifesto on establishing the State Duma as a legislative and consultative body on August 6, 1905. However, on October 17, 1905 the all-Russia political strike made the emperor sign a manifesto on improvement of the state order which vested the Duma with powers of a lawmaking body.

A festive opening ceremony of the first Duma was held on April 27, 1906. The total number of its members ranged between 480 and 524 in different years. The country’s parliament was empowered to endorse the laws submitted by the government and approve the state budget. In the parliament prior to the revolutionary years party factions were formed. The Duma has introduced the procedure for considering legislative initiatives, openness of its meetings, deputy requests and settlement of disagreements by conciliatory committees. The law granted the right for freedom of speech at the parliamentary rostrum to lawmakers that was particularly important in Russia in those years.

Tsarist Russia has had the four Dumas until the overthrow of monarchy. From the very start of its activity the parliament engaged in confrontation with authorities. As a result from four convocations only the third Duma has worked for the whole legitimate five-year term. The first Duma has worked only for 72 days from April 27 to July 8, 1906 being disbanded by Nicholas II. The same fate befell the second State Duma that has worked from February 20 to June 3, 1907. This Duma was disbanded over the accusation against the Social Democratic faction of a military coup. The third Duma has worked from November 1, 1907 to June 9, 1912. The last Duma in the history of Imperial Russia has operated from November 15, 1912 until October 6 (19), 1917.

In 1917 the February Revolution occurred in the country that resulted in the toppling of the monarchy and a dual power in the country between the Provisional Government and the Council of Workmen’s and Soldiers’ Deputies. The Provisional Government attempted to form a new parliament and elections in the first all-Russia Constituent Assembly were held in November 1917. But the Bolsheviks have disbanded the All-Russia Constituent Assembly already on January 6, 1918.

After the October Revolution in 1917 the All-Russia Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) became the supreme legislative body of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). After establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922 the Central Executive Committee with one house was formed and a two-house supreme state body was founded in 1924 to work between the Congresses of Soviets of the Soviet Union. A two-house Supreme Council has replaced the All-Russia Central Executive Committee in 1936.

In the early 90s after the Soviet Union breakup introduction of the post of RSFSR president and re-division of functions between different branches of power became an important change in the state system. The Federal Assembly became a representative and legislative body of Russia according to the Constitution enacted in 1993.

The Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation consists of two houses - the Federation Council upper house and the State Duma lower house. The State Duma comprising 450 lawmakers is formed in national direct elections and represents the country’s population in general, the Federation Council consisting of 170 members acts as a representative body of constituent entities of the federal state [by one representative from representative and executive authorities in each Russian federal constituent entity]. Lawmakers of the State Duma and the Federation Council work on a professional permanent basis. The State Duma is elected for a five-year term fixed in the country’s Constitution, the Federation Council does not have a limited term of powers.

Lawmaking is the main function of the State Duma, particularly endorsement of federal and constitutional laws, resolutions within its jurisdiction. The Federation Council has the main goal to perform legislative powers, including consideration of laws approved by the State Duma, ratification and denouncement of international treaties, the issues of status and protection of the state border, the matters of war and peace.

The State Duma declares an amnesty, empowers the president to appoint the prime minister, settles the issue of trust to the government, the issue of bringing accusations against the president for his impeachment and hears a governmental report. The Federation Council has the powers to announce presidential elections and to relieve the president from the post. The Federation Council appoints the judges of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court and the general prosecutor. The State Duma appoints and relieves from the post the Central Bank chairman and the human rights commissioner. Parliamentary houses divide powers to appoint the leadership and auditors of the Chamber of Accounts and members of the Central Election Commission. Meetings of both parliamentary chambers are held separately.

First elections in the State Duma in modern Russian history were held on December 12, 1993. Lawmakers of the second State Duma were elected on December 17, 1995, the third Duma - on December 19, 1999, the fourth one - on December 7, 2003, the fifth one - on December 2, 2007 and the sixth State Duma - on December 4, 2011. The first Duma was elected for two years, the term of next four lower houses has made four years and current sixth State Duma was elected for five years.

Elections in the lower house of parliament were held according to the mixed election system from single-seat constituencies and the federal district [federal lists of candidates] from 1993 to 2003. Fifth and sixth State Dumas were elected according to the proportional system on federal candidate lists nominated by political parties.

In 2016, elections in a seventh State Duma will be held according to the mixed election system that envisages that half of deputies [225 lawmakers] will be elected in single-mandate constituencies and another half of lawmakers - in the federal electoral district. The law to this effect was enacted on February 24, 2014.

At elections in the incumbent sixth State Duma four parties from seven ones registered in the country at that moment were elected in the parliament and formed their factions in the lower house. United Russia Party has gained 238 mandates, the Communist Party of Russia (CPRF) - 92 seats, A Just Russia Party - 64 seats and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) - 56 mandates.

Based on 2013 performance, Rosneft became the third largest gas producer in Russia, having produced 38.17 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas. The record-setting more than two-fold increase of gas production is related primarily to the addition of large gas assets following acquisition of TNK and consolidation of NGK Itera. In 2013, the Company worked to lay the foundation for the future growth of is gas business through organic growth of gas production. Among other things, the Company focused its efforts on active development of the Rospan project (development of the Vostochno-Urengoiskoe and Novo-Urengoiskoe license blocks) and obtaining approval for a comprehensive field development plan for gas deposits of the Kharampurskoe field. Gas sales in 2013 amounted to 39.07 bcm, including 24.02 bcm in West Siberia, 10.42 bcm in the European part of Russia, and 0.94 bcm outside of Russia.

Thanks to its considerable reserves, Rosneft has an immense production increase potential.

 

Rosneft's plans

LNG market presents one of the opportunities for Rosneft’s gas reserves monetisation. Working with ExxonMobil, the company is studying feasibility of building a 5 million tonnes per annum LNG plant in the Russian Far East.

Rosneft is considering several gas sales options for the proposed plant. The Company has already signed LNG contracts with Japanese Marubeni and Sodeco. Stable LNG demand in Asia-Pacific countries guarantees Rosneft a sustainable market for that project.

Some of the future production volumes of the proposed plant have been contracted by one the world’s trading leader, the Vitol company, which allows Rosneft to diversify risks in the global LNG trading market.

At this time, Rosneft is successfully implementing its programme to bring its associated gas utilisation ratio to 95%

  joking. Protesters are demanding that police surrender and leave
  the HQ. A group of people formed a “human corridor” through which

  Lugansk expecting to hear the government’s response to their
  ultimatum issued on Sunday. The people are demanding amnesty for

Oleksandr Turchynov said on Wednesday his goal now was to prevent the agitation from spreading to other territories.

I will be frank: today, security forces are unable to quickly take the situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions under control, Turchynov said at a meeting with regional governors.

The security bodies ... are unable to carry out their duties of protecting citizens. They are helpless in those matters.

Moreover, some of those units are either helping or cooperating with terrorist organisations, he said.

Turchynov instructed the governors to try to prevent the threat from overtaking more central and southern regions.

Mercenaries and special units that are active on Ukrainian territory have been tasked with attacking those regions. That is why I am stressing: our task is to stop the spread of the terrorist threat first of all in the Kharkiv and Odessa regions, Turchynov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

Military drills

Kiev city authorities, meanwhile, announced unexpected middle-of-the night military drills starting on Wednesday night to Thursday morning which will involve military equipment, further stoking tensions.

Russia has placed tens of thousands of troops near the border with Ukraine, and Turchynov said the threat of a Russian invasion was real.

He called for creating regional self-defence units throughout the country, according to Interfax.

Some Ukrainians said they were appalled by the loss of control over eastern regions and accused the central government of inaction.

In a normal society when Oleksandr Turchynov admits the fact that the authorities do not control the situation in the east of the country is ground for resignation. And not just of him, but all the security forces, Valeriy Kalnysh, former editor of the Kommersant daily, wrote on Facebook. But can we afford this now? .... And is it the right move in the conditions of an undeclared war with Russia?

Turchynov spoke hours after pro-Russian gunmen seized more administrative buildings in eastern Ukraine. Insurgents wielding automatic weapons took control and hoisted an insurgent flag on top of the city council building on Wednesday morning in the city of Horlivka in the Donetsk region. They also took control of a police station in the city, adding to another police building which they had controlled for several weeks.

An Associated Press reporter saw armed men standing guard outside the building and checking the documents of those entering.

One of the men said foreign reporters would not be allowed in and threatened to arrest those who did not obey orders. Similar guards were also seen outside the police station in the city.

The pro-Russian separatists now control buildings in about a dozen cities in eastern Ukraine, demanding broader regional rights as well as greater ties or outright annexation by Russia. They are holding some activists and journalists hostage, including a group of observers from a European security organisation.

In Luhansk, one of the largest cities in eastern Ukraine, gunmen in camouflage uniforms maintained control of several government offices they seized on Tuesday.

Eastern Ukraine, which has a large Russian-speaking population, was the heartland of support for Viktor Yanukovych, the ousted president who fled to Russia in February.

The government that replaced him in Kiev has resisted the separatists' demands, fearing they could lead to a breakup of the country or mean that more regions could join Russia, as Crimea did.

Kiev and Western governments accuse Moscow of orchestrating the protests in eastern Ukraine. The United States and the European Union rolled out a fresh set of economic sanctions against Russia this week, but Moscow hasremained unbowed, denying its role in the unrest and saying the actions were Kiev's fault.

China's defense ministry did not give an exact location in the East China Sea, where Beijing is locked in an increasingly bitter dispute with Japan over the ownership of a group of uninhabited islets.

These drills are regular exercises held by China and Russia's navies, and the purpose is to deepen practical cooperation between the two militaries, to raise the ability to jointly deal with maritime security threats, the ministry said on its website.

It provided no other details.

China alarmed Japan, South Korea and the United States last year when it announced an air defense identification zone for the East China Sea, covering the islands.

The Beijing government, which is swiftly ramping up military spending, has regularly dispatched patrols to the East China Sea since it established the defense zone.

China was angered last week after U.S. President Barack Obama assured ally Japan that Washington was committed to its defense, including the disputed isles.

Earlier this month, Tokyo announced it would break ground on a new radar base in the area, on a tropical Japanese island close to Taiwan.

The radar station on Yonaguni Island, just 150 km (93 miles) from the disputed islands in the East China Sea, marks Japan's first military expansion at the western end of its island chain in more than 40 years.

The Ukrainian army is on full alert due to the “threat of a Russian invasion,” Ukraine’s acting President Aleksandr Turchinov said after admitting that the government in Kiev cannot control the situation in the east of the country.

“I am going back to the real threat that Russia would unleash
  a continental war against Ukraine. Our armed forces have been put
  on full alert,” Turchinov told Wednesday a council of heads
  of Ukrainian regions in Kiev, as news agencies report.



  He called on the audience to speed up the creation of regional
  militias loyal to Kiev.
  “We must have the capability to move those units fast to
  support other regions against such a threat,” he stressed.



  Turchinov admitted that Kiev simply cannot get the situation in
  the rebellious eastern regions under control and reiterated
  earlier accusations, saying some people in law enforcement
  “are cooperating with terrorist organizations,” the name
  Kiev authorities use to refer to anti-government protesters who
  are seizing government buildings in eastern Ukraine.


“Our primary task is to prevent the spread of the terrorist
  threat to other regions of Ukraine,” he said.



  In contradiction to the previous moves of the government, which
  included raids on protester checkpoints and other demonstrations
  of force, Turchinov said “as we know from the experience of
  Maidan, the use of force is inefficient. That’s the situation we
  faced in the eastern regions.”


  Earlier on Tuesday, the acting president said in a televised
  address that the situation in the east of the country
  “demonstrated inaction, helplessness and sometimes
  treason” and pledged to sack many officers in eastern
  regions of Ukraine.



  Turchinov was elected a new speaker of the parliament and
  appointed by the MPs to act as the country’s acting president
  after the previous leader, Viktor Yanukovich, was ousted
  following violent street protests in February.
  
  The new authorities in Kiev are failing to deal with a wave of
  protests against them centered in the Donetsk Region of eastern
  Ukraine.



  Despite announcing an “anti-terrorist operation” and amassing a
  large number of troops and heavy weapons in the region, the
  national government has failed to prevent the continued seizures
  of buildings there and some other eastern regions of Ukraine.



  There are indications that Kiev does not have enough loyal troops
  to deliver on its promised protest crackdown. On several
  occasions the troops sent against activists simply defected,
  surrendering their weapons and armored vehicles.","Ukrainian army ‘on full alert’, president admits east is beyond control

Sith Lord Darth Vader, whose Ukraine presidency bid was earlier rejected, has been registered as a candidate for mayoral elections in the capital Kiev and the port city of Odessa, with a plan to run for the top seat in “all key cities” in the country.


  The Odessa election commission voted Thursday to register 'Darth
  Nikolayevich Vader' for the mayoral election on May 25, the same
  day that Ukraine is due to elect a new president.



  The Star Wars villain will fight for the post with 18 other
  contenders – primarily earthly Ukrainian politicians and
  businessmen.



  “The registration is completed. The first step towards the
  victory is made. Power is itself coming into my hands and I’m not
  ready to resist,” said Vader, according to the website for
  the Internet party of Ukraine, which nominated him as a
  candidate.



  The former Jedi Knight and deputy leader of the party has also
  registered to take part in the Kiev mayoral vote. Vader has twice
  won the party's primaries, the group said.



  Apparently, an unsuccessful attempt to join Ukraine’s
  presidential race has not discouraged Lord Vader. Earlier this
  year, he submitted documents to the Central Election
  Commission, but was refused registration, while two courts in
  Kiev threw out his suits against the decision.



  “They stole my victory at the presidential elections, but
  failed to steal my will for the victory. I assure all my
  supporters – my decisiveness has never been stronger than it is
  now,” Vader said. “That’s why I made a decision to run
  for mayor, mayors of all key cities in Ukraine. Soon I will be in
  your city, too.”



  Vader’s “cabinet maker” is already working on a proper imperial
  seat, or rather a throne, that Lord Vader is planning to place in
  his office if he wins.



  Vader is not a newbie to Ukrainian politics. During the 2012
  parliamentary election, he scored three percent of votes,
  according to his party. Unfortunately, the votes were never
  registered because supporters each had to add Vader’s name to the
  ballots, which rendered them void under Ukrainian law.","Dark side of Ukraine’s election: Darth Vader runs for mayor in Kiev, Odessa

Five people have requested medical assistance after explosions occurred at an ammunition depot near the village of Bolshaya Tura in East Siberia’s Trans-Baikal Territory, officials told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.

“Those who requested assistance are those who were injured during the first explosions when the shockwave smashed windows in houses. They mainly have cuts,” Denis Kurochkin, the prosecutor of the Trans-Baikal Territory’s Karymskaya District, said. “According to preliminary data, no one has died.”

Ukraine’s State Guard and police units held a civil protection drill in Kiev on Wednesday night, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital said.


  Security forces inspected government buildings and trained on
  APCs during the civil protection drill, which took place
  overnight in the Ukrainian capital. Military equipment was
  transported via the shortest routes from one location to another.



  Security forces also checked Kiev’s bomb shelters and the
  presence of drinking water sources, said Kiev’s mayor, Vladimir
  Bondarenko.



  A short statement was published on Kiev City Hall’s
  website early on Wednesday, warning “residents and guests of
  the capital” of a special tactical drill to “be held in
  Kiev on the night of April 30 to May 1.”


  The announcement attracted huge attention from both the media and
  Kiev residents, as it promised “columns of combat
  vehicles” moving through the city during the exercise.
  
  However, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry hurried to refute the
  claims by the mayor’s office, stating that the country's armed
  forces were not planning to hold any military drills in the
  capital.
  
  “The announcement of a special tactical exercise, which was
  posted today – April 30 – on the official website of the Kiev
  city administration has nothing to do with the activities of the
  Defense Ministry and the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed
  Forces,” a statement on the Defense Ministry’s website
  said.
  
  “The personnel and military vehicles of the city’s garrison
  remain at the place of their permanent location. Their deployment
  in the city’s center is not expected,” the statement added.
  
  Later on Wednesday, Kiev's Mayor Vladimir Bondareko appeared on
  Ukrainian television to clarify the situation.
  
  He stated that only troops from the State Guard and Interior
  Ministry – not the army – would be taking part in the night
  drill.
  Today we are working with units...which must protect the
  population in case of certain events. So, today we’ll try to
  train the movement of these units. They will arrive in of
  Pechersk district (a historical neighborhood in central Kiev),
  where the government institutions are situated, and then return
  to their bases,” Bondareko said.
  
  The mayor explained that the exercises are vital due to the
  events taking place in southeastern Ukraine. Protests against the
  coup-imposed Ukrainian government are on the rise in the region,
  with anti-Kiev activists seizing administrative buildings and
  demanding a referendum on federalization.
  
  We must be ready for everything, and Kiev’s city
  administration is doing all it can that if, God forbid, something
  happens, we’ll be able to hide in shelters and get water; so that
  we knew where to go for medical aid,” he stressed.



  Earlier Ukraine’s coup-appointed President Aleksandr Turchinov
  announced that the army is now in a state of high alert due to
  the real threat of a Russian military invasion.



  At the same time he admitted that Kiev cannot control the
  situation in the east of Ukraine, where anti-government
  protesters are continuing to take over government buildings.



  The clashes on Tuesday night happened between an
  ultra-nationalist Social-National Assembly, a faction of the
  Right Sector militant group and members of the Maidan
  self-defense militia, as the nationalists were holding a torch
  rally through central Kiev.



  Many Ukrainian nationalists are appalled by the Ukrainian
  government’s failure to crackdown on the eastern Ukrainian
  protest. Some even call for another change at the top.

  inspired by Russia, although no explanation was given as to how
  Russia could have any influence on that group.

“This procedure is provided for in the rules of the Organisation,” the source said, adding that “Russia sent a note to the EU Mission at the WTO and notified the WTO Secretariat thereof”.

The Russian Ministry of Economic Development said earlier it was planning to file such a lawsuit before the end of the first quarter of 2014. In late 2013, Russia filed a lawsuit against the EU over energy adjustments.

Russia’s complaints about the Third Energy Package also remain in force. “We do not remove this issue from the agenda. It’s number two on the list. As regards the Third Energy Package, we are planning to start an investigation within the WTO framework in the first quarter of 2014,” Deputy Minister of Economic Development Alexei Likhachev said in December.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev earlier disagreed with Europe's position on the Third Energy Package as it calls for a revision of existing agreements.

“As for antimonopoly structures, we are not against different procedures if they occur by law, but we think the position on the Third Energy Package is wrong,” Medvedev said.

“Even if it pursues positive goals, it has a significant impact on existing ties and means a rejection of current agreements,” Medvedev said, adding that Russia thinks thought it was a violation.

President Vladimir Putin said he was hopeful that a compromise on the EU Third Energy Package could be reached.

“I do hope very much that we will be able to find a solution to these complex problems and questions through dialogue of partners,” he said.

At the same time, he said it would be unacceptable if the provisions of “the Third Energy Package” were applied retroactively to affect current contracts between Gazprom and consumers.

“All kinds of unilateral decisions are made - ‘the Third Energy Package,’ and it gets applied retroactively in an absolutely unprecedented way, which would seem unacceptable in the modern civilised world, and yet this happens,” he said.

According to Putin, the Third Energy Package can cause damage.

However European Commission’s Directorate-General for Energy said that it was designed to ensure a higher degree of competition in the market as EU countries must not depend on any one source of energy supplies.

It confirmed that the EU had no problems with Russian companies if they played by European rules and said that Russia should ratify the Energy Charter in order to reduce risks related to trade and investments in the energy sector.

“The sides are expected to reiterate their intention to develop mutually advantageous energy cooperation for creating an integrated energy complex in Europe, while pressing for strict compliance with existing bilateral and multilateral contractual obligations,” Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said.

According to the European Commission, the Third Energy Package should promote competition in the EU energy market and push energy prices down in Europe.

One of its most controversial provisions demands that all energy transit infrastructure be handed over to autonomous operators independent from energy generating and mineral producing companies.

Russian Permanent Representative to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov said that the enforcement of this provision has “basically led to nationalisation of pipelines in some East European countries.”

As for the WTO, European Commissioner for Trade Karel De Gucht earlier accused Russia of failure to fulfill its obligations within the WTO. Among trade problems between Russia and the EU, he named specifically increased duties on imported motor vehicles and a ban on the import to Russia of certain kinds of cattle from EU countries that do not meet Russia's overstated veterinary requirements.

The European Union’s Third Energy Package is a legislative package for an internal gas and electricity market in the European Union. Its purpose is to further open up the gas and electricity markets in the European Union. The package was proposed by the European Commission in September 2007, and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in July 2009. It entered into force on September 3, 2009.

Core elements of the third package include ownership unbundling, which stipulates the separation of companies’ generation and sale operations from their transmission networks, and the establishment of a National Regulatory Authority (NRA) for each member state, and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators which provides a forum for NRAs to work together.","GENEVA, April 30 /ITAR-TASS/.

We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia, said a joint statement issued by leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, plus the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission.

The announcement came as Moscow staged military drills on the joint border with Ukraine Thursday, responding to Kiev's anti-terror operation that resulted in the deaths of five pro-Moscow protesters.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday it was Kiev not implementing the agreement, and that Moscow had been eager to assist in the de-escalation of tension as agreed in last week's Geneva deal.

The minister accused the West of attempting to capture Ukraine for geopolitical ambitions, rather than the interests of the Ukrainian people.

In Friday's announcement, the G7 nations urged Russia to join efforts to seek a diplomatic resolution of the crisis, threatening broader, coordinated sanctions, including sectoral measures, in the event of further destabilizing moves from Russia.

The United States and EU had hit dozens of Russians and pro-Russia Ukrainians, including close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with travel bans and asset freezes following Moscow's annexation of Crimea last month.

However, the 28-member bloc remains divided over full trade and economic sanctions against Russia, considering the huge gas supplies from the country and their broad economic ties.

UN chief troubled by rhetoric, hardening of positions on Ukraine

UNITED NATIONS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged on Friday all parties involved in the Ukraine crisis to honor their commitments under the Geneva Statement, calling for an immediate halt of violence in Ukraine and practical steps to de- escalate the tension.

At a daily news briefing here, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said: The secretary-general is alarmed by the continued violence and loss of life in eastern Ukraine. The instability is contributing to a climate of fear and anxiety that can lead to a dangerous cycle of escalating tensions and serious miscalculations.Full story

Lukashenko urges Russia, West to calm down to stabilize situation in Ukraine

MINSK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The West and Russia should both calm down to stabilize situation in Ukraine, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday, underscoring the need for a credible leadership to further set the course for Ukraine.

People trusted no one in Ukraine as they have been cheated and betrayed many times, the president said. Today there is a need for a person, a group of people who could tell people what they are going to do, which path they are going to choose.Full story","WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations agreed Friday night to impose more sanctions on Russia over its inaction in easing the tension in eastern Ukraine.

We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia, said a joint statement issued by leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, plus the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission.

The announcement came as Moscow staged military drills on the joint border with Ukraine Thursday, responding to Kiev's anti-terror operation that resulted in the deaths of five pro-Moscow protesters.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday it was Kiev not implementing the agreement, and that Moscow had been eager to assist in the de-escalation of tension as agreed in last week's Geneva deal.

The minister accused the West of attempting to capture Ukraine for geopolitical ambitions, rather than the interests of the Ukrainian people.

In Friday's announcement, the G7 nations urged Russia to join efforts to seek a diplomatic resolution of the crisis, threatening broader, coordinated sanctions, including sectoral measures, in the event of further destabilizing moves from Russia.

The United States and EU had hit dozens of Russians and pro-Russia Ukrainians, including close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with travel bans and asset freezes following Moscow's annexation of Crimea last month.

However, the 28-member bloc remains divided over full trade and economic sanctions against Russia, considering the huge gas supplies from the country and their broad economic ties.

New round of Western sanction against Russia will target seven individuals and 17 companies. They are meant to affect Moscow’s stance over the ongoing Ukrainian crisis.


  The individuals listed by the US Department of Treasury on Monday
  include Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, chair of the
  parliamentary commission on Foreign Affairs, Aleksey Pushkov,
  chief of presidential office, Vyacheslav Volodin, and Igor
  Sechin, the head of Rosneft oil company.
  
  The list of sanctioned companies, which Washington believes to be
  “linked to Putin’s inner circle,” includes several banks,
  construction and transport companies.
  
  The Volga Group, an investment vehicle that manages assets on
  behalf of the businessman, Gennady Timchenko, and SMP Bank, whose
  main shareholders were affected by the previous set of US
  sanctions, are among those to face restrictive measures.
  
  Oil and gas engineering company, Stroytransgaz, and one of
  Russia’s biggest rail transporters of oil, Transoil, are also
  among the companies affected by the sanctions.
  
  The US Department of Commerce has introduced additional
  restrictions on 13 of those companies by imposing a license
  requirement with a presumption of denial for the export,
  re-export or other foreign transfer of US-originating items to
  the companies.
  
  Later in the day, Washington announced a tightened policy to deny
  export license applications for any high-technology items that
  could contribute to Russia’s military capabilities.
  
  But the US may move even further and impose sanctions against
  specific branches of the Russian economy if Moscow begins a
  military operation in Ukraine, Jay Carney, White House spokesman,
  said.



  The announcement of a new round of US sanctions against Russia is
  “revolting” as they go against the way civilized states should
  communicate, Sergey Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister,
  said.
  
  “We will respond, although it is not our choice,” Ryabkov is
  cited as saying by Itar-Tass news agency. “But we can’t leave
  this situation without reaction, without practical reaction,
  without reaction by means of our own decisions. US behavior in
  the field is becoming provocative.”
  According to the deputy FM, the American decision stems from a
  “distorted and groundless” assumption on the state of
  affairs in Ukraine.



  Obama said the US and its allies would keep broader sanctions
  “in reserve” in the event of further escalation on the
  ground in Ukraine. He admitted that he was uncertain whether the
  latest round of measures would be effective.


“The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally; the goal
  is to change his calculus, to encourage him to walk the walk, not
  just talk the talk on diplomacy to resolve the crisis,
  Obama said in Manila during a trip to Asia.

  As the US pushes for more sanctions against Russia, EU members
  have preliminary agreed to also impose asset freezes and visa
  bans on 15 more people. The names of those to be added to the
  list will not be made public until they are published in the EU's
  Official Journal on Tuesday, Reuters reported citing an unnamed
  diplomat source. However, Many Europeans opposed anti-Russian
  sanctions, which would target the economy as opposed to
  individuals close to the Russian leadership, since economic
  sanctions would hurt European economies as well as that of
  Russia. The US, being economically tied with Russia to a much
  lesser degree than Europe, says it would not impose economic
  sanctions unilaterally.


“I would be very surprised if all European countries found a
  common position on economic sanctions,” Thierry Mariani, a
  member of the French National Assembly, told RT. “When one
  country says ‘we don’t speak about finance’… and some other
  country says ‘we don’t speak about energy,’ then we don’t speak
  about anything. That’s why we arrive unfortunately [at] personal
  sanctions, which are completely nonsense.”


  Canada has also imposed sanctions on two Russian banks and nine
  individuals, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement
  announcing the measures on Monday. Harper's office did not
  immediately provide names.



  The Russian leadership has thus far brushed off the threat of
  sanctions as ineffectual, arguing they might in fact buoy the
  Russian economy in the long term.


“Overreliance can lead to a loss of sovereignty,”
  Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a media forum in St
  Petersburg on Thursday.



  Western-led sanctions have several advantages for Russia, Putin
  said.



  Putin said the threat of real economic sanctions is already
  bolstering domestic businesses, bringing more offshore funds back
  to Russia, and giving policymakers the push they need to
  establish a domestic payment system.



  His comments echo sentiments made by Russian Prime
  Minister Dmitry Medvedev last week, who similarly argued that
  further sanctions would only make Russia stronger.


“Thanks to Western sanctions, Russia has been given the
  incentive to reduce its dependence on outside and instead
  regional economies are being more self-sufficient, Medvedev
  said April 22.



  Medvedev said any restrictions on Russian goods to the EU or US
  would serve to redirect Russian exports to Asian markets, which
  are more robust.","Obama rolls out new sanctions on Russia, Moscow says it won't hurt

Chinese authorities have introduced amendments to the country’s Environmental Protection Law imposing tougher penalties on polluters, legislation that comes amid a growing environmental crisis that is choking the country.


  The amendments passed by the Standing Committee of China's
  National People's Congress (NPC), the country's top legislature,
  will come into effect in January 2015.



  It is the first change to the legislation in 25 years. The
  country’s Environmental Protection Law was introduced in 1989.



  The changes come in the wake of public concern over the high
  level of pollution in the country as well as a two-year debate
  among scholars, the government and state-owned enterprises over
  changes to environmental protection policies.



  Tightening the screws



  According to Xin Chunying, deputy director of the Standing
  Committee’s Legislative Affairs Commission, the legislation would
  deliver a blow ... to our country's harsh environmental
  realities, Reuters reported.



  It will enable the Environmental Protection Ministry to take
  stronger punitive action toward polluters, including shutting
  down and confiscating their assets. The amendments will also make
  public the information on environmental monitoring and introduce
  a daily-based fine system to punish offenders.



  The law says that those responsible for environmental pollution
  will face up to 15 days under arrest if their enterprise produces
  or uses forbidden pesticides and refuses to suspend production
  after being issued a ban.



  Chinese legislators also introduced an “ecological red
  line that will declare certain regions off-limits for
  polluting industries. The law also contains special articles and
  provisions on tackling smog as well as making citizens more aware
  of environmental protection.



  Local officials may be demoted or sacked, if they are guilty of
  covering up environment-related wrongdoing, falsifying data or if
  they don’t give closure orders to enterprises which illegally
  discharge pollutants, the amendments say.



  June 5 has also been declared Environment Day in the country.



  China’s environmental tragedy


The biggest breakthrough is ... that [the ministry] have
  used a professional document to talk about the disclosure of
  environmental information and public participation,” said Ma
  Jun, head of the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs,
  an independent environmental group. “This, in fact,
  establishes some of the public's basic environmental
  rights.


  The Chinese government has been trying to introduce policies to
  clean up the environment, including “cloud seeding” –
  artificial rain – to disperse the smog that affects the majority
  of the country’s cities.



  The smog has become so thick it is impeding photosynthesis,
  potentially disrupting China’s food supply. According to an
  associate professor at China Agricultural University, He
  Dongxian, if air pollution continues at the same rate, China will
  experience something akin to a “nuclear winter.”


  According to China’s deputy minister of environmental protection,
  71 out of 74 cities monitored in China for pollution in 2013 fail
  to meet Beijing-set standards.



  The deteriorating quality of drinking water is considered one of
  the country’s major problems. According to an annual report by
  China’s Ministry of Land and Resources, at least 60 percent of underground water is polluted
  in the country.



  The enormous rate of the water pollution in the country sparked
  new concerns in April after cancer-inducing benzene was found in water supply in the city of
  Lanzhou, which is considered one of the most polluted in the
  country.



  The soil is also massively polluted across the country. According
  to a report released earlier in April on the website of the
  Ministry of Environmental Protection, one-fifth of Chinese
  farmland is polluted as a result of the country’s dramatic
  industrialization, overuse of farm chemicals and minimal
  environmental protection.","Choking crisis: China imposes stricter penalties against polluters

The move to ban visas and freeze assets of the likes of Putin's friend Igor Sechin, head of oil giant Rosneft, also drew fire from President Barack Obama's domestic critics, who called it a slap on the wrist.

EU states added 15 more Russians and Ukrainians to their blacklist and will reveal them on Tuesday.

The new round of U.S. sanctions, following those imposed last month when Russia annexed Crimea, barely registered in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow rebels were holding a group of German and other OSCE military observers for a fourth day.

Despite a Ukrainian military operation to contain them, the militants extended their grip by seizing key public buildings in another town in the Donetsk region. In the regional capital, Donetsk, club-wielding pro-Russian activists broke up a rally by supporters of the Western-backed government in Kiev.

The high-profile mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, was badly wounded by a gunman, raising fears of further unrest in a Russian-speaking region that has seen less trouble of late than the neighboring provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.

U.S. sanctions were aimed, Washington officials said, at cronies of Putin. Seven men, including Sechin, were targeted by visa bans and freezing of any U.S. assets, and 17 companies were also named.

The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally, Obama said. The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.

Washington will also deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities and revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions, the White House said.

In addition to Sechin, the Russians sanctioned by the United States included another Putin ally, Sergei Chemezov, head of Rostec, a Russian state-owned high-tech products company.

The others named were Oleg Belavencev, Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea, Dmitry Kozak, deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, Evgeniy Murov, director of Russia's federal protective service, Aleksei Pushkov, a state Duma deputy, and Vyacheslav Volodin, a Putin adviser.

Not included was Gazprom chief Alexei Miller, a close ally of Putin who had been seen as a possible target.

Obama is under pressure from opposition Republicans at home to move faster on sanctions. But in taking what he described as calibrated steps, he has emphasized a need to act in concert with European countries, which have more at stake economically and a more cumbersome process for taking decisions.

There was little prospect of a change in the calculus for Putin, who critics say is stirring up fear among ethnic Russians in order to redraw post-Soviet borders and rebuild Moscow's empire.

Washington is in effect reviving ... an old method of restricting normal cooperation, from Cold War times, essentially chasing itself into a dark, dusty closet of a bygone era, said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, describing the sanctions as illegitimate, uncivilized and in breach of international law.

In an hour-long phone call with U.S. Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu voiced concern about an unprecedented increase in U.S. and NATO activity near Russia's borders and urged Hagel to help turn down the rhetoric over Ukraine, Moscow's Defense Ministry said.

RALLY ATTACKED

Both sides continue to offer diametrically mirror-image versions of events in Ukraine. The West sees the pro-Western leaders who took power after Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovich fled to Russia in February as legitimate and believes Putin is trying to undermine their efforts to hold an election.

For Moscow, they are fascists and putschists, anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalists against whom the Russian speakers of Crimea and the east have risen up in self-defence - a view it broadcasts into Ukraine on state-run Russian media.

Opinion polls show substantial but still only minority support in the depressed, industrial east of Ukraine for it to follow Crimea into union with Russia.

Several people were injured on Monday after dozens of men in military fatigues, carrying baseball bats and throwing firecrackers, tried to break up a demonstration in Donetsk.

A crowd of about 2,000 waved Ukrainian flags and chanted: Donetsk is Ukraine and Putin, no, but they dispersed after the assault, in which Reuters journalists saw at least 10 people treated for head injuries.

Earlier in the same region, armed men in camouflage who refused to identify themselves seized the police station and town hall in Kostyantynivka. Reuters journalists saw about 20 well-organized gunmen controlling the administration building. They erected a barricade of tires, sandbags and concrete blocks.

Soviet songs played over loudspeakers, and women gathered signatures in support of an uprising against rule from Kiev.

Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, a colorful and well-known figure nationwide, was shot in the back while out exercising, and doctors are battling to save his life. Kernes, 54, is a member of the party through which Yanukovich and fellow easterners had dominated a Ukrainian system widely seen as deeply corrupt.

Among the most prominent Jewish politicians in the country who earned his wealth from business dealings in the crime-ridden 1990s, Kernes had called for Kharkiv to quit Ukraine after Yanukovich fell, but had lately clamped down on separatists. The government said police were looking into whether the assassination attempt was linked to the arrest of pro-Russian separatists on Sunday.

GERMAN HOSTAGES

Although Russia signed a deal with Ukraine and Kiev's U.S. and EU allies at Geneva 10 days ago under which militants should surrender to OSCE monitors, it flatly denies Ukrainian and Western assertions it is controlling the militants' activities and that it has special forces orchestrating events on the ground.

Russia's involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable, a White House statement said.

After an appeal from Germany, long Moscow's firmest advocate in the West, for Russia to intervene to secure the release of the seven European monitors, four of whom are German, Moscow's ambassador to the OSCE said it would be good if they were freed.

But he also condemned the OSCE, of which Russia is a member, for being extremely irresponsible in sending them to eastern Ukraine. Moscow has condemned the Kiev authorities for failing to provide security in the industrial and heavily populated east, close to the Russian border.

In the face of Western and Ukrainian calls for it to pull back troops massed on Ukraine's frontier, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday it had deep concern about forces Kiev has sent to the region, suggesting that Ukrainian troops might be preparing for the destruction of entire cities.

In the separatist military stronghold at Slaviansk, the self-declared mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said he had given OSCE mediators a list of detainees his movement wanted freed by Kiev in return for the OSCE observers he is holding.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said the jailed leader of an earlier separatist protest in Donetsk was on hunger strike to protest against his torture. It also cited reports that Ukraine was building detention centers very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps for dissenting citizens in the east.

The Moscow stock market shrugged off the sanctions, rising almost 1 percent when they failed to penalize more companies.

Although its chief executive, Sechin, was hit by a visa ban, few expected Rosneft or its international partners to suffer much, though its shares lost 1.7 percent on the day.

Western countries say sanctions are already having an effect on Russia by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The central bank has raised interest rates to support the ruble, and Russian firms are finding it harder to raise funds.

U.S. sanctions were aimed, Washington officials said, at cronies of Putin. Seven men, including Sechin, were targeted by visa bans and freezing of any U.S. assets, and 17 companies were also named.

The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally, Obama said. The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.

Washington will also deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities and revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions, the White House said.

In addition to Sechin, the Russians sanctioned by the United States included another Putin ally, Sergei Chemezov, head of Rostec, a Russian state-owned high-tech products company.

The others named were Oleg Belavencev, Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea, Dmitry Kozak, deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, Evgeniy Murov, director of Russia's federal protective service, Aleksei Pushkov, a state Duma deputy, and Vyacheslav Volodin, a Putin adviser.

Not included was Gazprom chief Alexei Miller, a close ally of Putin who had been seen as a possible target.

Obama is under pressure from opposition Republicans at home to move faster on sanctions. But in taking what he described as calibrated steps, he has emphasized a need to act in concert with European countries, which have more at stake economically and a more cumbersome process for taking decisions.

There was little prospect of a change in the calculus for Putin, who critics say is stirring up fear among ethnic Russians in order to redraw post-Soviet borders and rebuild Moscow's empire.

Washington is in effect reviving ... an old method of restricting normal cooperation, from Cold War times, essentially chasing itself into a dark, dusty closet of a bygone era, said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, describing the sanctions as illegitimate, uncivilized and in breach of international law.

In an hour-long phone call with U.S. Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu voiced concern about an unprecedented increase in U.S. and NATO activity near Russia's borders and urged Hagel to help turn down the rhetoric over Ukraine, Moscow's Defense Ministry said.

RALLY ATTACKED

Both sides continue to offer diametrically mirror-image versions of events in Ukraine. The West sees the pro-Western leaders who took power after Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovich fled to Russia in February as legitimate and believes Putin is trying to undermine their efforts to hold an election.

For Moscow, they are fascists and putschists, anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalists against whom the Russian speakers of Crimea and the east have risen up in self-defence - a view it broadcasts into Ukraine on state-run Russian media.

Opinion polls show substantial but still only minority support in the depressed, industrial east of Ukraine for it to follow Crimea into union with Russia.

Several people were injured on Monday after dozens of men in military fatigues, carrying baseball bats and throwing firecrackers, tried to break up a demonstration in Donetsk.

A crowd of about 2,000 waved Ukrainian flags and chanted: Donetsk is Ukraine and Putin, no, but they dispersed after the assault, in which Reuters journalists saw at least 10 people treated for head injuries.

Earlier in the same region, armed men in camouflage who refused to identify themselves seized the police station and town hall in Kostyantynivka. Reuters journalists saw about 20 well-organized gunmen controlling the administration building. They erected a barricade of tires, sandbags and concrete blocks.

Soviet songs played over loudspeakers, and women gathered signatures in support of an uprising against rule from Kiev.

Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, a colorful and well-known figure nationwide, was shot in the back while out exercising, and doctors are battling to save his life. Kernes, 54, is a member of the party through which Yanukovich and fellow easterners had dominated a Ukrainian system widely seen as deeply corrupt.

Among the most prominent Jewish politicians in the country who earned his wealth from business dealings in the crime-ridden 1990s, Kernes had called for Kharkiv to quit Ukraine after Yanukovich fell, but had lately clamped down on separatists. The government said police were looking into whether the assassination attempt was linked to the arrest of pro-Russian separatists on Sunday.

GERMAN HOSTAGES

Although Russia signed a deal with Ukraine and Kiev's U.S. and EU allies at Geneva 10 days ago under which militants should surrender to OSCE monitors, it flatly denies Ukrainian and Western assertions it is controlling the militants' activities and that it has special forces orchestrating events on the ground.

Russia's involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable, a White House statement said.

After an appeal from Germany, long Moscow's firmest advocate in the West, for Russia to intervene to secure the release of the seven European monitors, four of whom are German, Moscow's ambassador to the OSCE said it would be good if they were freed.

But he also condemned the OSCE, of which Russia is a member, for being extremely irresponsible in sending them to eastern Ukraine. Moscow has condemned the Kiev authorities for failing to provide security in the industrial and heavily populated east, close to the Russian border.

In the face of Western and Ukrainian calls for it to pull back troops massed on Ukraine's frontier, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday it had deep concern about forces Kiev has sent to the region, suggesting that Ukrainian troops might be preparing for the destruction of entire cities.

In the separatist military stronghold at Slaviansk, the self-declared mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said he had given OSCE mediators a list of detainees his movement wanted freed by Kiev in return for the OSCE observers he is holding.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said the jailed leader of an earlier separatist protest in Donetsk was on hunger strike to protest against his torture. It also cited reports that Ukraine was building detention centers very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps for dissenting citizens in the east.

The Moscow stock market shrugged off the sanctions, rising almost 1 percent when they failed to penalize more companies.

Although its chief executive, Sechin, was hit by a visa ban, few expected Rosneft or its international partners to suffer much, though its shares lost 1.7 percent on the day.

Western countries say sanctions are already having an effect on Russia by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The central bank has raised interest rates to support the ruble, and Russian firms are finding it harder to raise funds.

U.S. President Barack Obama called for the United States and Europe to join forces to impose stronger measures to restrain Moscow. The White House said it will add names on Monday of people close to President Vladimir Putin and firms they control to a list of Russians hit by sanctions over Ukraine, and also impose new restrictions on high tech exports.

The European Union is expected to follow suit by adding to its own list of targeted Russian people and firms, but Washington and Brussels have yet to reach agreement on wider measures designed to hurt the Russian economy more broadly.

In Donetsk, where pro-Russian rebels have proclaimed an independent people's republic, armed fighters seized the headquarters of regional television and ordered it to start broadcasting a Russian state TV channel.

Speaking during a visit to Malaysia, Obama said restraining Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions in Ukraine would depend on the United States and its allies finding a unified position on tighter sanctions.

We're going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified and the United States and Europe is unified rather than this is just a U.S.-Russian conflict, Obama told reporters.

White House deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the new U.S. measures would be imposed on Monday, mostly focused on adding to a list of those barred from travel to the United States and hit by asset freezes.

We will be looking to designate people who are in (Putin's) inner circle, who have a significant impact on the Russian economy. We'll be looking to designate companies that they and other inner circle people control, Blinken told CBS television.

We'll be looking at taking steps, as well, with regard to high-technology exports to their defense industry. All of this together is going to have an impact.

The stand-off over Ukraine, an ex-Soviet republic of about 45 million people, has dragged relations between Russia and the West to their lowest level since the end of the Cold War.

After Ukrainians overthrew a pro-Russian president, Putin overturned decades of international diplomacy last month by announcing the right to use military force on his neighbor's territory. He has seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and massed tens of thousands of troops on the frontier.

Heavily armed pro-Russian gunmen have seized buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Kiev and its Western allies say the uprising is directed by Russian agents. Moscow denies it is involved and says the uprising is a spontaneous reaction to oppression of Russian speakers by Kiev.

An international agreement reached this month calls on rebels to vacate occupied buildings, but Obama said Russia had not lifted a finger to push its allies to comply.

In fact, there's strong evidence that they've been encouraging the activities in eastern and southern Ukraine.

PRISONERS

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has sent unarmed monitors to try to encourage compliance with the peace deal. The pro-Russian rebels seized eight European monitors three days ago and have been holding them at their most heavily-fortified redoubt in the town of Slaviansk.

One, a Swede, was permitted to leave on Sunday after OSCE negotiators arrived to discuss their release. A separatist spokeswoman said the prisoner had been let go on medical grounds, but there were no plans to free the rest.

The captives, from Germany, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland and Sweden, were paraded before reporters on Sunday and said they were in good health.

We have no indication when we will be sent home to our countries, the group's leader, German Colonel Axel Schneider, told reporters as armed men in camouflage fatigues and balaclavas looked on. We wish from the bottom of our hearts to go back to our nations as soon and as quickly as possible.

Germany denounced the appearance and said Moscow must press their captors to free the prisoners.

The public parading of the OSCE observers and Ukrainian security forces as prisoners is revolting and blatantly hurts the dignity of the victims, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement.

It is an infringement of every rule of behavior and standards that are made for tense situations like this. Russia has a duty to influence the separatists so that the detained members of the OSCE mission are freed as soon as possible.

The OSCE, a European security body, includes Russia. Its main Ukraine mission was approved by Moscow, although the Europeans held in Slaviansk were on a separate OSCE-authorized mission that did not require Russia's consent.

Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the rebel leader who has declared himself mayor of Slaviansk, has described them as prisoners of war and said the separatists were prepared to exchange them for fellow rebels in Ukrainian custody.

Washington is more hawkish on further sanctions than some of its European allies, which has caused a degree of impatience among some U.S. officials. Many European countries are worried about the risks of imposing tougher sanctions - the EU has more than 10 times as much trade with Russia as the United States and imports about a quarter of its natural gas from Russia.

RUSSIA! RUSSIA!

At the Donetsk television headquarters, about 400 pro-Russian demonstrators chanted Russia! Russia! and Referendum! - a call for a vote like one in Crimea that preceded its annexation by Russia last month. Four separatists in masks controlled access at the entrance, and more masked gunmen in camouflage fatigues could be seen inside.

Oleg Dzholos, the station's director, who came outside to speak to reporters, said the people who seized the building had ordered him to change the programming.

They used force to push back the gates, he said. There were no threats. There were not many of my people. What can a few people do? The leaders of this movement just gave me an ultimatum that one of the Russian channels has to be broadcast.

Ponomaryov, the rebel leader in Slaviansk, said his men had captured three officers with Ukraine's state security service who, he said, had been mounting an operation against separatists in the nearby town of Horlivka.

The Russian television station Rossiya 24 showed footage it said was of a colonel, a major and a captain. They were shown seated, with their hands behind their backs, blindfolded, and wearing no trousers. At least two had bruises on their faces.

Ukraine's State Security Service said the three had been part of a unit which went to Horlivka to arrest a suspect in the murder of Volodymyr Rybak, a pro-Kiev councillor whose body was found last week in a river near Slaviansk.

Here are the key words, phrases, people and places involved.

We've added Donbass, Donetsk People's Republic, green men,Novorossiya, Transnistria and Dmytro Yarosh, as well as edited throughout. (What else should we add? E-mail!)

Anti-protest laws: Measures Viktor Yanukovych passed Jan. 16 designed to limit protests. Dubbed the Dictatorship Laws by protesters, they led to a new level of violence in the Euromaidan protests and were repealed by parliament two weeks later.

Berkut: Descended from an elite force in Soviet times, the Berkut were Ukrainian riot police who operated under the Interior Ministry. At the center of much of the violence with Euromaidan protesters, they were disbanded Feb. 26. There were reports in March that Russia is givin out passports to ex-Berkut officers.

Black Sea Fleet: A Russian naval unit that has been based in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. It’s not a particularly powerful force. It consists of an aging guided-missile cruiser, the Moskva; a large, dated anti-submarine-warfare cruiser; a destroyer; two frigates; landing ships; and a diesel-powered attack submarine. Viktor Yanukovych and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev reached a deal to extend the lease on facilities in Crimea until 2042 in exchange for a discounted deal for natural gas.

The Budapest Memorandum: An agreement in 1994 that saw Russia, the United States and Great Britain agree to recognize the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine in exchange for it giving up its stockpile of nuclear weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that this agreement is void, as Ukraine is no longer the same state it was in 1994.

Crimea: A peninsula jutting into the northern tip of the Black Sea. This strategically located region has been fought over many times over the course of its complicated history. Long a part of Russia, it was given to Ukraine in 1954, though it enjoyed a good dose of autonomy. Residents of Crimea, the majority of whom are ethnically Russian, voted March 16 to leave Ukraine and join Russia.

Crimean War: A three-year war that started in 1853 and ended up with Russia keeping Crimea even though it lost the war. Russia fought an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia over disputes involving the Middle East and religion. It's widely considered the beginning of modern warfare.

Crimean Tatars: A Sunni Muslim, Turkic ethnic group that has been in Crimea since before it became part of Russia. Notably, the entire population was deported to Central Asia as punishment for collaboration with German forces during World War II. Since 1991, they have been coming back in droves: By Ukraine's last census in 2001, they were said to make up 12 percent of the population. As you might imagine, they are said to be anti-Russian and largely supportive of the Euromaidan protests. NB: It's Tatar, not Tartar.

The demographic split: To put this very simply, thanks to a complicated history, Ukraine can broadly be split between a Ukrainian-speaking West and a Russian-speaking East. Some have argued that this is an oversimplification (most things are), but it does still seem to hold weight.

Donbass: A region of eastern Ukraine with an unofficial capital of Donetsk. Pro-Russian separatists are operating in parts of this region.

Donetsk People's Republic: A self-declared breakaway region of Ukraine in the eastern region of Donetsk, the the pro-Russian Donetsk People's Republic seeks a break from Kiev. The region is not recognized by outside states and there have been some questions about its legitimacy. In mid-April, a number of masked men carrying a Russian flag reportedly handed out leaflets demanding that Jews register. The leaflet bore the logo of the Donetsk People's Republic, though temporary leader Denis Pushilin denied any involvement.

Euromaidan: The name given to the anti-government protests that began Nov. 21, 2013, and eventually led to the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych. The name comes from the hopes of further European integration many had, and the name of their central Kiev location, Maidan Nezalezhnosti.

The family: The name given to Viktor Yanukovych's immediate family and other associates who are said to have enriched themselves through corruption and nepotism.

Fascists: Both Russia's foreign ministry and Viktor Yanukovych have linked fascist elements to the Euromaidan protests. There is some truth to this – far-right Ukrainian nationalist groups, such as Svoboda or Pravy Sektor, have been a part of the protests. Maidan supporters, however, dispute the idea that the protests are at all dominated by these groups, and critics have accused the Kremlin of playing political football with (the very real threat) of anti-Semitism in Ukraine.

Gazprom:Russia's huge, state-controlled gas company. Russia says Ukraine owes it $2.2 billion for fuel and that Ukraine will have to start paying for gas in advance unless it pays down that debt. The last time Russia and Ukraine argued over prices, Gazprom turned off the gas. Also worth noting: 15 percent of Europe’s gas imports come through Ukraine, the Financial Times reports.

Green men: The euphemism used to describe the irregular or paramilitary forces deployed first in Crimea and now in Eastern Ukraine in the service of pro-Russia separatists. These troops wore uniforms with no emblem or insignia, allowing Moscow to initially dismiss claims that it was behind the separatist takeover of parts of Ukraine. But Western governments are firmly convinced that these “green men” are directly linked to the Russian military.

Kiev:Ukraine’s capital (also written as Kyiv) and the center of protests against the Yanukovych government. Its population tends to lean more to the west and Europe than east to Russia. It was also the focal point of protests in the Orange Revolution in 2004.

Klitschko, Vitali: A former professional boxer and heavyweight champion, Klitschko was perhaps one of the most prominent political leaders at the Euromaidan protests, and certainly one of the best-known internationally. In a leaked phone call, however, U.S. officials spoke disapprovingly of his chances for leadership. He is currently leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform.

Lustration: As Will Englund wrote for The Post, Maidan protesters used the phrase lustration to describe what they want from the new government. The term was first used after the fall of the Soviet Union to describe the purge of Communist officials from the government and bureaucracy in post-Soviet states. In Ukraine, however, it's being used to describe the purging of the government of those associated with Viktor Yanukovych.

Lviv: A culturally important city in Ukraine's west. Lviv apparently played a big role in the Euromaidan protests: It was reported to be sending 1,000 protesters a day to Maidan Nezalezhnosti at the height of the protests.

Magnitsky Act: A U.S. human rights law that created a blacklist of Russian officials last year. Bill Browder, a fund manager at the center of campaigning for the act, has told The Washington Post that it should be expanded in light of the Crimea crisis.

Maidan Nezalezhnosti: A square at the center of Kiev, its name quite literally means Independence Square. It was at the heart of protests against Soviet rule in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the Orange Revolution.

NATO's Article 4: Poland has requested meetings under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Here's the full text of that article: The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened. NATO meetings for Article 4 are exceptionally rare: Only Turkey has used them before, twice during the Iraq war and once during the Syrian conflict.

Novorossiya: A term referenced by Russian President Vladimir Putin that means New Russia. It's territory won from the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century that included much of what is now eastern Ukraine. The term has also been brought up by pro-Russia activists in Ukraine as they've argued against staying with Kiev.

Orange Revolution: A series of protests that began in November 2004 following the disputed election of Viktor Yanukovych as president. That vote was thrown out by the country's Supreme Court and a re-vote was held that put Viktor Yushchenko in office. Protests ended in January 2005 with Yushchenko's inauguration. Much like the Euromaidan protests, the center of the action was Maidan Nezalezhnosti — and protesters considered themselves more European than their Russia-leaning countrymen in the east.

Putin, Vladimir: A former KGB agent in East Germany, St. Petersburg native Putin had an unexpected rise through Russia's political elite during the 1990s before becoming prime minister in 1999 and president in 2000. Apart from a brief period between 2008 and 2012 when he was prime minister again (during which many suspected he was still the real power), Putin has been leading the country ever since. He believes that the new Euromaidan-linked Ukraine government is illegitimate and led by fascists.

Russia:Ukraine’s neighbor to the east. It’s big and powerful and taking a strong interest in Ukraine. You’ve probably heard of it.

Russo-Georgian war: A short war in 2008 between Russia and former Soviet republic Georgia over the separatist states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It took just five days for Russia to overwhelm Georgia's far smaller army. Some believe that the war was a blatant act of aggression by Russia, and that it set a worrying precedent for the situation happening now in Crimea.

Sanctions: The United States and the European Union have both targeted a number of Russian individuals with sanctions due to their involvement in the Ukrainian crisis. While the sanctions took aim at a number of Putin's inner circle and won plaudits from some, some on the list have mocked it as ineffective. The U.S. is said to be considering more sanctions.

Sevastopol: The deep-water port in Crimea is home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and was the headquarters of Ukraine’s navy. Sevastopol was under siege for 11 months during the Crimean War and was heavily bombed by the Germans during World War II. It’s also a popular seaside resort and looks, feels and sounds like a little corner of Russia.

Transnistria: A sliver of Moldova that split away from the country as the Soviet Union collapsed and has effectively been a Russian and Ukrainian-speaking enclave ever since. In late March, a senior NATO leader warned that Russia might try and move its troops across Ukraine to reach this area. It's home to a Russian army base and has a population of about a half a million.

Turchynov, Oleksandr: Current acting president of Ukraine and speaker of the Verkhovna Rada. According to the BBC, he has said he would seek to reopen negotiations with the European Union, but has also said he is open to dialogue with Russia. Considered an ally of Yulia Tymoshenko.

Tymoshenko, Yulia:: Tymoshenko rose to power as one of the predominant leaders of 2004's Orange Revolution and became prime minister of Ukraine in 2005. Her eventual fallout with Viktor Yushchenko lead to her star falling, however, and she lost the 2010 presidential election to Viktor Yanukovych. In her time in office, however, she helped negotiate a new gas deal with Russia that bypassed companies linked with Yanukovych but saw Ukraine pay a higher price. After Yanukovych came to power, she was charged with misuse of power and sent to jail, only to be released in February after Euromaidan.

Ukraine: A country about the size of Texas with a population of about 46 million bordered by Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Belarus and — this one is important — Russia. It got its independence when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Please note, it's not the Ukraine, just Ukraine.

Verkhovna Rada: Often just called the Rada, this is Ukraine's parliament. It's played an important role in Ukraine's crisis, pulling back Viktor Yanukovych's more drastic anti-protest laws, releasing Yulia Tymoshenko and ultimately ousting Yanukovych.

Yanukovych, Viktor:  Yanukovych was president of Ukraine from 2010 till February 2014, though he claims he is still president. Raised in eastern Ukraine, he is said to have had a rocky start in life, and ended up in jail twice (though the BBC notes that his official biography claims that the convictions were eventually overturned). He worked his way up through the post-Soviet political world to eventually run in the 2004 presidential elections but never actually took office after the Orange Revolution questioned the legitimacy of the vote and he lost the re-vote. Yanukovych's critics say he has enriched himself at his country's expense and see his lavish mansion near Kiev as evidence of that.

Yarosh, Dmytro: Yarosh is the leader of the far-right Ukrainian nationalist group Pravy Sektor and candidate for the country’s May 25 presidential elections. The former Soviet soldier’s fiery brand of politics — and belief in the usefulness of militant action — has made him an easy target of the Kremlin. Ahead of Moscow’s de facto annexation of Crimea, Russian officials warned of the danger by the creeping “fascism” of Ukrainian nationalists like Yarosh to ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. In the wake of a deadly shootout in eastern Ukraine this weekend, Russian media pinned the attack on Yarosh and Pravy Sektor. A spokesman for the group rejected the charge as “absurd.”

Yatsenyuk, Arseniy: Current prime minister of Ukraine and leader of Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland party. In a leaked phone call between Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, Nuland and Pyatt agreed that Yatsenyuk had good economic experience.","About six weeks ago, we published a glossary of key terms in the Ukraine crisis; since then, Crimea voted to become part of Russia and conflict has shifted to the eastern part of the country. Here are the key words, phrases, people and places involved.

We've added Donbass, Donetsk People's Republic, green men,Novorossiya, Transnistria and Dmytro Yarosh, as well as edited throughout. (What else should we add? E-mail!)

Anti-protest laws: Measures Viktor Yanukovych passed Jan. 16 designed to limit protests. Dubbed the Dictatorship Laws by protesters, they led to a new level of violence in the Euromaidan protests and were repealed by parliament two weeks later.

Berkut: Descended from an elite force in Soviet times, the Berkut were Ukrainian riot police who operated under the Interior Ministry. At the center of much of the violence with Euromaidan protesters, they were disbanded Feb. 26. There were reports in March that Russia is givin out passports to ex-Berkut officers.

Black Sea Fleet: A Russian naval unit that has been based in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. It’s not a particularly powerful force. It consists of an aging guided-missile cruiser, the Moskva; a large, dated anti-submarine-warfare cruiser; a destroyer; two frigates; landing ships; and a diesel-powered attack submarine. Viktor Yanukovych and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev reached a deal to extend the lease on facilities in Crimea until 2042 in exchange for a discounted deal for natural gas.

The Budapest Memorandum: An agreement in 1994 that saw Russia, the United States and Great Britain agree to recognize the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine in exchange for it giving up its stockpile of nuclear weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that this agreement is void, as Ukraine is no longer the same state it was in 1994.

Crimea: A peninsula jutting into the northern tip of the Black Sea. This strategically located region has been fought over many times over the course of its complicated history. Long a part of Russia, it was given to Ukraine in 1954, though it enjoyed a good dose of autonomy. Residents of Crimea, the majority of whom are ethnically Russian, voted March 16 to leave Ukraine and join Russia.

Crimean War: A three-year war that started in 1853 and ended up with Russia keeping Crimea even though it lost the war. Russia fought an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia over disputes involving the Middle East and religion. It's widely considered the beginning of modern warfare.

Crimean Tatars: A Sunni Muslim, Turkic ethnic group that has been in Crimea since before it became part of Russia. Notably, the entire population was deported to Central Asia as punishment for collaboration with German forces during World War II. Since 1991, they have been coming back in droves: By Ukraine's last census in 2001, they were said to make up 12 percent of the population. As you might imagine, they are said to be anti-Russian and largely supportive of the Euromaidan protests. NB: It's Tatar, not Tartar.

The demographic split: To put this very simply, thanks to a complicated history, Ukraine can broadly be split between a Ukrainian-speaking West and a Russian-speaking East. Some have argued that this is an oversimplification (most things are), but it does still seem to hold weight.

Donbass: A region of eastern Ukraine with an unofficial capital of Donetsk. Pro-Russian separatists are operating in parts of this region.

Donetsk People's Republic: A self-declared breakaway region of Ukraine in the eastern region of Donetsk, the the pro-Russian Donetsk People's Republic seeks a break from Kiev. The region is not recognized by outside states and there have been some questions about its legitimacy. In mid-April, a number of masked men carrying a Russian flag reportedly handed out leaflets demanding that Jews register. The leaflet bore the logo of the Donetsk People's Republic, though temporary leader Denis Pushilin denied any involvement.

Euromaidan: The name given to the anti-government protests that began Nov. 21, 2013, and eventually led to the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych. The name comes from the hopes of further European integration many had, and the name of their central Kiev location, Maidan Nezalezhnosti.

The family: The name given to Viktor Yanukovych's immediate family and other associates who are said to have enriched themselves through corruption and nepotism.

Fascists: Both Russia's foreign ministry and Viktor Yanukovych have linked fascist elements to the Euromaidan protests. There is some truth to this – far-right Ukrainian nationalist groups, such as Svoboda or Pravy Sektor, have been a part of the protests. Maidan supporters, however, dispute the idea that the protests are at all dominated by these groups, and critics have accused the Kremlin of playing political football with (the very real threat) of anti-Semitism in Ukraine.

Gazprom:Russia's huge, state-controlled gas company. Russia says Ukraine owes it $2.2 billion for fuel and that Ukraine will have to start paying for gas in advance unless it pays down that debt. The last time Russia and Ukraine argued over prices, Gazprom turned off the gas. Also worth noting: 15 percent of Europe’s gas imports come through Ukraine, the Financial Times reports.

Green men: The euphemism used to describe the irregular or paramilitary forces deployed first in Crimea and now in Eastern Ukraine in the service of pro-Russia separatists. These troops wore uniforms with no emblem or insignia, allowing Moscow to initially dismiss claims that it was behind the separatist takeover of parts of Ukraine. But Western governments are firmly convinced that these “green men” are directly linked to the Russian military.

Kiev:Ukraine’s capital (also written as Kyiv) and the center of protests against the Yanukovych government. Its population tends to lean more to the west and Europe than east to Russia. It was also the focal point of protests in the Orange Revolution in 2004.

Klitschko, Vitali: A former professional boxer and heavyweight champion, Klitschko was perhaps one of the most prominent political leaders at the Euromaidan protests, and certainly one of the best-known internationally. In a leaked phone call, however, U.S. officials spoke disapprovingly of his chances for leadership. He is currently leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform.

Lustration: As Will Englund wrote for The Post, Maidan protesters used the phrase lustration to describe what they want from the new government. The term was first used after the fall of the Soviet Union to describe the purge of Communist officials from the government and bureaucracy in post-Soviet states. In Ukraine, however, it's being used to describe the purging of the government of those associated with Viktor Yanukovych.

Lviv: A culturally important city in Ukraine's west. Lviv apparently played a big role in the Euromaidan protests: It was reported to be sending 1,000 protesters a day to Maidan Nezalezhnosti at the height of the protests.

Magnitsky Act: A U.S. human rights law that created a blacklist of Russian officials last year. Bill Browder, a fund manager at the center of campaigning for the act, has told The Washington Post that it should be expanded in light of the Crimea crisis.

Maidan Nezalezhnosti: A square at the center of Kiev, its name quite literally means Independence Square. It was at the heart of protests against Soviet rule in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the Orange Revolution.

NATO's Article 4: Poland has requested meetings under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Here's the full text of that article: The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened. NATO meetings for Article 4 are exceptionally rare: Only Turkey has used them before, twice during the Iraq war and once during the Syrian conflict.

Novorossiya: A term referenced by Russian President Vladimir Putin that means New Russia. It's territory won from the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century that included much of what is now eastern Ukraine. The term has also been brought up by pro-Russia activists in Ukraine as they've argued against staying with Kiev.

Orange Revolution: A series of protests that began in November 2004 following the disputed election of Viktor Yanukovych as president. That vote was thrown out by the country's Supreme Court and a re-vote was held that put Viktor Yushchenko in office. Protests ended in January 2005 with Yushchenko's inauguration. Much like the Euromaidan protests, the center of the action was Maidan Nezalezhnosti — and protesters considered themselves more European than their Russia-leaning countrymen in the east.

Putin, Vladimir: A former KGB agent in East Germany, St. Petersburg native Putin had an unexpected rise through Russia's political elite during the 1990s before becoming prime minister in 1999 and president in 2000. Apart from a brief period between 2008 and 2012 when he was prime minister again (during which many suspected he was still the real power), Putin has been leading the country ever since. He believes that the new Euromaidan-linked Ukraine government is illegitimate and led by fascists.

Russia:Ukraine’s neighbor to the east. It’s big and powerful and taking a strong interest in Ukraine. You’ve probably heard of it.

Russo-Georgian war: A short war in 2008 between Russia and former Soviet republic Georgia over the separatist states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It took just five days for Russia to overwhelm Georgia's far smaller army. Some believe that the war was a blatant act of aggression by Russia, and that it set a worrying precedent for the situation happening now in Crimea.

Sanctions: The United States and the European Union have both targeted a number of Russian individuals with sanctions due to their involvement in the Ukrainian crisis. While the sanctions took aim at a number of Putin's inner circle and won plaudits from some, some on the list have mocked it as ineffective. The U.S. is said to be considering more sanctions.

Sevastopol: The deep-water port in Crimea is home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and was the headquarters of Ukraine’s navy. Sevastopol was under siege for 11 months during the Crimean War and was heavily bombed by the Germans during World War II. It’s also a popular seaside resort and looks, feels and sounds like a little corner of Russia.

Transnistria: A sliver of Moldova that split away from the country as the Soviet Union collapsed and has effectively been a Russian and Ukrainian-speaking enclave ever since. In late March, a senior NATO leader warned that Russia might try and move its troops across Ukraine to reach this area. It's home to a Russian army base and has a population of about a half a million.

Turchynov, Oleksandr: Current acting president of Ukraine and speaker of the Verkhovna Rada. According to the BBC, he has said he would seek to reopen negotiations with the European Union, but has also said he is open to dialogue with Russia. Considered an ally of Yulia Tymoshenko.

Tymoshenko, Yulia:: Tymoshenko rose to power as one of the predominant leaders of 2004's Orange Revolution and became prime minister of Ukraine in 2005. Her eventual fallout with Viktor Yushchenko lead to her star falling, however, and she lost the 2010 presidential election to Viktor Yanukovych. In her time in office, however, she helped negotiate a new gas deal with Russia that bypassed companies linked with Yanukovych but saw Ukraine pay a higher price. After Yanukovych came to power, she was charged with misuse of power and sent to jail, only to be released in February after Euromaidan.

Ukraine: A country about the size of Texas with a population of about 46 million bordered by Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Belarus and — this one is important — Russia. It got its independence when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Please note, it's not the Ukraine, just Ukraine.

Verkhovna Rada: Often just called the Rada, this is Ukraine's parliament. It's played an important role in Ukraine's crisis, pulling back Viktor Yanukovych's more drastic anti-protest laws, releasing Yulia Tymoshenko and ultimately ousting Yanukovych.

Yanukovych, Viktor:  Yanukovych was president of Ukraine from 2010 till February 2014, though he claims he is still president. Raised in eastern Ukraine, he is said to have had a rocky start in life, and ended up in jail twice (though the BBC notes that his official biography claims that the convictions were eventually overturned). He worked his way up through the post-Soviet political world to eventually run in the 2004 presidential elections but never actually took office after the Orange Revolution questioned the legitimacy of the vote and he lost the re-vote. Yanukovych's critics say he has enriched himself at his country's expense and see his lavish mansion near Kiev as evidence of that.

Yarosh, Dmytro: Yarosh is the leader of the far-right Ukrainian nationalist group Pravy Sektor and candidate for the country’s May 25 presidential elections. The former Soviet soldier’s fiery brand of politics — and belief in the usefulness of militant action — has made him an easy target of the Kremlin. Ahead of Moscow’s de facto annexation of Crimea, Russian officials warned of the danger by the creeping “fascism” of Ukrainian nationalists like Yarosh to ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. In the wake of a deadly shootout in eastern Ukraine this weekend, Russian media pinned the attack on Yarosh and Pravy Sektor. A spokesman for the group rejected the charge as “absurd.”

Yatsenyuk, Arseniy: Current prime minister of Ukraine and leader of Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland party. In a leaked phone call between Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, Nuland and Pyatt agreed that Yatsenyuk had good economic experience.",2602

“Vladimir Putin is the most impressive leader in the world today,” Galloway said. “He has rallied the peoples of the Russian Federation behind a project of national re-building of the economy, the dignity and the prestige once universally recognized and often admired.”

In an interview in the forthcoming issue of GQ magazine, Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond revealed admiration for “certain aspects” of President Vladimir Putin and praised the way Russia’s national pride has been restored.

“He’s restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing,” Salmond said. “There are aspects of Russian constitutionality and the inter-mesh with business and politics that are obviously difficult to admire,” he added.

“After the national disaster of the Yeltsin era, when Russia's national wealth was looted and often shipped abroad and an oligarchy and mafia-driven state disintegration was gathering pace, Putin has stopped this in its tracks and begun to reverse it,” George Galloway told RIA Novosti.

“I don't approve of a range of Russian actions, but I think Putin's more effective than the press he gets, I would have thought, and you can see why he carries support in Russia,” Salmond said.

Galloway noted that much remains still to be done in Russia, though it “was and is again a great power in the world.”

“It has ended the unipolar period when the US, a giant with the mind of a child, did exactly as it pleased and returned a potential equilibrium to world affairs. President Putin has been the key to these changes,” Galloway said.

Salmond made his remarks on March 14, prior to the public referendum in Crimea which saw 96 percent of the people voting to rejoin Russia.

In a telephone conversation with Swiss Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairperson in Office Didier Burkhalter on Saturday, April 26, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of politically-motivated arrests of public activists in the South-East of Ukraine and urged him to press for their speediest release.

Burkhalter told Lavrov that the OSCE had secured access to Donetsk Region people’s governor Pavel Gubarev and would publish a memo on his condition after the visit scheduled for April 26.

On Thursday, April 24, Lavrov said Moscow had sent official letters to the OSCE and the ICRC requesting immediate access to Gubarev.

“We will push for immediate access to Gubarev to make sure that he has no problems with health,” Lavrov said. “We will of course continue efforts aimed at ensuring his immediate release as a political prisoner.”

Lavrov said in an interview with the RT television channel on April 23 that despite “an agreement on amnesty for political prisoners, Donetsk Region people’s governor Pavel Gubarev is in prison. Gubarev never seized buildings, he was arrested only for calls for a referendum on federalisation. Gubarev is a political prisoner.”

A crowd of demonstrators in a square in the centre of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on March 1 proclaimed Pavel Gubarev people’s governor. The Ukrainian Security Service SBU promptly opened a criminal case against him on the suspicion of calls for changing Ukraine’s borders.

Gubarev, detained on March 6, is being held in Kiev’s pre-trial detention centre.

“Having thanked Burkhalter for these efforts, Lavrov drew his attention to other arrests of public activists in the South-East for political reasons and called on him to press for getting access to them and ultimately for their speediest release,” the Foreign Ministry said.

Burkhalter said he was hoping to get from protesters in the south-eastern regions a complete list of such persons so that he could take necessary measures.

He thanked Lavrov for Russia’s efforts to free the European military observers who had arrived in Ukraine at Kiev’s invitation under the Vienna Document of 2011 on confidence- and security-building measures and headed to south-eastern regions without properly notifying the public bodies that are controlling the situation in the region.

On Friday, April 25, supporters of federalisation in Slavyansk, a city in the south-East of Ukraine, detained a bus with passengers, with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities.

The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures.

Yevgeny Gorbik, a spokesperson for the supporters of federalisation, told reporters that the detained military observers had been engaged in intelligence activities.

“The humanitarian group of the [OSCE] mission has denied any relation to them… They [observers] had intelligence agents, cryptograms, and notebooks with secret notes”, Gorbik said. “A Bulgarian officer had a notebook with notes in Russian which confirm his intelligence activities and speak of a meeting with agents,” he added.

“No charges have been brought against them so far. But they’ve ended up in a company that calls into question the legitimacy of their activities,” Gorbik said, adding, “The investigation is underway to find out what they were doing and where”.

Vyacheslav Ponomarev, the people’s mayor of Slavyansk, said the detained persons were not members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission but were military observers. “The military were on our territory without our permission and were detained of course,” he said.

“What we should do with them we will know after we have determined who they are and what brought them here,” Ponomarev said, adding that the detainees were being held in “normal conditions”. “One of the military officials has diabetes, but we have necessary medications and food [for him].”

Ponomarev said the supporters of federalisation were ready to exchange the detained military for their comrades being held by the Kiev authorities.

“The Kiev junta is holding our comrades. But we are ready for an exchange if there is such a chance,” he said.","MOSCOW, April 26, /ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation with Swiss Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairperson in Office Didier Burkhalter on Saturday, April 26, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of politically-motivated arrests of public activists in the South-East of Ukraine and urged him to press for their speediest release.

Burkhalter told Lavrov that the OSCE had secured access to Donetsk Region people’s governor Pavel Gubarev and would publish a memo on his condition after the visit scheduled for April 26.

On Thursday, April 24, Lavrov said Moscow had sent official letters to the OSCE and the ICRC requesting immediate access to Gubarev.

“We will push for immediate access to Gubarev to make sure that he has no problems with health,” Lavrov said. “We will of course continue efforts aimed at ensuring his immediate release as a political prisoner.”

Lavrov said in an interview with the RT television channel on April 23 that despite “an agreement on amnesty for political prisoners, Donetsk Region people’s governor Pavel Gubarev is in prison. Gubarev never seized buildings, he was arrested only for calls for a referendum on federalisation. Gubarev is a political prisoner.”

A crowd of demonstrators in a square in the centre of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on March 1 proclaimed Pavel Gubarev people’s governor. The Ukrainian Security Service SBU promptly opened a criminal case against him on the suspicion of calls for changing Ukraine’s borders.

Gubarev, detained on March 6, is being held in Kiev’s pre-trial detention centre.

“Having thanked Burkhalter for these efforts, Lavrov drew his attention to other arrests of public activists in the South-East for political reasons and called on him to press for getting access to them and ultimately for their speediest release,” the Foreign Ministry said.

Burkhalter said he was hoping to get from protesters in the south-eastern regions a complete list of such persons so that he could take necessary measures.

Members of the US House and Senate are working together to craft legislation that would reform US-government-funded broadcasting outlets like Voice of America. The bill would require the channels to “support” US “public diplomacy” and “policy objectives.”


  Reform legislation in the House would change the
  language of Voice of America’s mission to demand adherence to US
  foreign policy directives, according to a report by Foreign
  Policy magazine, calling into question how much editorial
  independence Voice of America (VOA) will have left.


It is time for broad reforms; now more than ever, U.S.
  international broadcasts must be effective, Rep. Ed Royce
  (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said
  in a statement.



  The bill has been in the works among top Republicans and
  Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs and the Senate Foreign
  Relations Committees for a year, Foreign Policy wrote. The House bill, supported by Foreign
  Affairs Committee head Eliot Engel, will get a panel vote on
  Wednesday.



  Not only does the bill aim to clarify VOA’s mission – which has
  arguably leaned away from consistently backing the official line
  in Washington in recent years – but it also reorganizes the
  federal agency that oversees US-funded media outlets, the
  Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG).



  BBG will go from having part-time board members leading the
  organization – US Secretary of State John Kerry is one current
  board member – to a full-time agency official
  directing daily operations. The bill would also consolidate Radio
  Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcasting
  Network into one “non-federal organization,” Foreign
  Policy reported. The legislation will also attempt to cut the
  number of federal contractors that work at the outlets.


This legislation makes clear that the Voice of America
  mission is to support U.S. public diplomacy efforts, a
  summary of the new bill outlines. The VOA charter states
  that VOA will provide a ‘clear and effective presentation of the
  policies of the United States...Over time, VOA has abandoned this
  mission.


  A spokesperson for BBG would not speak on the proposal. The
  agency does not comment on pending legislation, Lynne Weil
  told Foreign Policy.



  VOA, by far the most widespread of BBG’s networks, produces news
  and cultural programming in 45 languages and reaches more than
  164 million people around the world through television, radio,
  internet, and mobile platforms.



  It began as an arm of the Office of War Information in
  1942 as a way to match Nazi and Japanese propaganda. The State
  Department and the US Information Agency took it over in the
  1950s, when it turned to counter Communist countries during the
  Cold War. VOA’s global broadcasts of American jazz music were
  popular at this time. Major live VOA broadcasts include Martin
  Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” address in 1963 and
  the 1969 moon landing, which 450 million people heard on hundreds
  of stations worldwide.



  In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed into law VOA’s mission as
  an accurate, objective, and comprehensive news outlet
  as opposed to an explicit propagandistic venture.



  Since then, “employees at the TV and radio broadcaster have
  insisted on viewing themselves as objective journalists as
  opposed to instruments” of the US government’s policies
  abroad, wrote Foreign Policy. And since, on occasion, VOA has
  highlighted stories that did not reflect well on the United
  States, US officials have wondered why hundreds of millions of
  dollars is spent on a project that does not have a more
  pro-American outlook.



  News of the reform bill comes days after the Sec. of State Kerry
  accused RT of being a state-sponsored
  “propaganda bullhorn” that is “deployed to promote
  President Putin’s fantasy about what is playing out on the
  ground” amid unrest in Ukraine. Furthermore, he said RT
  spends almost all its time “propagandizing and distorting
  what is happening, or not happening, in Ukraine.”


  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denounced Kerry’s latest comments about RT as
  “uncivilized” and “prosecutorial.”

“On the one hand we are pressured by the EU and the US, they say, as a member of the EU; we must take an attitude of solidarity in aiding Ukraine. But at the same time how do we defend the national interests of Slovakia, keeping up the level of income, which is perhaps the lowest in Europe as it is? We have to think of priorities,” Bachishin said, stressing that “for Slovakia the partnership with Gazprom is the number one priority today.”

“Gazprom may as well stop the transit of gas through Slovak territory in retaliation. After all, the company is a categorical opponent of reverse and it believes the action is complete fraud. Yes, we would get the North Stream gas quota, but would lose the status of transit country, i.e. would stop the supplies to the Czech Republic and Western Europe, he said.

Thus, we would sustain significant financial losses, something Ukraine must understand. Our transit contract with Gazprom is valid until 2029. It is clear, how sensitive to the costs to the Slovak economy may be in case of damaged relations with its Russian partner,” the expert said.

Bachishin said the idea of reversing gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine is hardly anything novel, but the implementation would require the construction of a new pipe from Ve?k? Kapu?any which receives Russian fuel to the Ukrainian town of Uzhgorod. It could pump up to 20 billion cubic meters of gas, but its construction would cost 20 million euros. The cost of the project is not the only reason why Bratislava is still not final on reverse, Bachishin noted.

Last week Bratislava hosted a trilateral meeting of Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuriy Prodan, Slovak Minister of Economy Tomas Malatinski and European Commissioner for Energy Guenther Oettinger.

Kiev is actively engaged in strengthening Ukraine's energy security, and is in talks to secure natural gas supplies from the EU.

In early April, Ukraine’s state-owned Naftogaz began importing gas from Poland through a pipeline reversal after Russia canceled gas discounts for Ukraine. The annual capacity of the route, 1.5 billion cubic meters of gas, is insufficient to meet the country’s demand. To increase supplies, Ukraine is trying to negotiate a reverse gas flow through Slovakia, which according to Naftogaz could supply up to 30 billion cubic meters of gas per year.","MOSCOW, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – Slovakia will have to choose to either support its own economy or that of Ukraine in deciding the issue of reverse gas supplies to its eastern neighbor, Vladimir Bachishin, a professor at Pan-European University in Bratislava, told the Voice of Russia radio station in an interview Monday.

“As for de-offshorization, the Russian authorities are facing many important and necessary tasks to create better conditions for doing business inside the country,” he said. “This means the tax system, its stability, rates, the fight against excessive bureaucratization and corruption, and many other things.”

Putin believes that sanctions will also prod the Russian authorities into working harder and taking measures to strengthen the sovereignty of the national economy by creating a national payment system or drafting a law on enhanced sovereignty in strategic industries.

“The world is globalizing and the economy and politics are closely interdependent but excessive dependence leads to the loss of sovereignty,” Putin said with regret and cited the country’s gold and currency reserves as an example. “Some countries with large gold and currency reserves diversify them one way or another,” he added.

“We did not create our own settlement system as Japan or China did, and this makes us completely dependent on our partners,” the president said. “We have always believed that our partners, both Visa and MasterCard, are depoliticized economic entities and companies. However, as it turned out, they, too, are under strong political pressure and influence and give in to it right away,” he said.

“This is a very big business for these companies. By acting the way they are acting in Russia, they are undermining trust in themselves and therefore will certainly lose the market,” he said.

At the same time, he noted that the Russian authorities were not planning any retaliatory sanctions against MasterCard or Visa. “However not only have we thought about it but we have also started creating our own national payment system,” Putin said.

Putin said in March that Russia would create its own payment system. “These systems work successfully in such countries as Japan and China. They started off as national systems for domestic needs only but are now becoming increasingly popular,” he said.

The Japanese system now operates in 200 countries. “Why shouldn’t we do the same? We should and we will,” Putin said at a meeting with the leadership of the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament.

The Central Bank of Russia is already making plans for creating a national payment system in the country.

“We should create a system that will ensure uninterrupted domestic payments that make up about 90 percent of the total. We are preparing measures that should be realistic, easy and gradual. At the initial stage we should ensure technological compatibility between processing and operating centers of major banks so that they could switch over quickly,” Central Bank Chair Elvira Nabiullina said.

A draft law ensuring uninterrupted money transfers within Russia will go to the State Duma, lower house of parliament, shortly. It bans all participants from terminating transfers unilaterally. Clearing centers will not be allowed to provide information about money transfers outside the country or make such information accessible from other countries.

In 2011, several MPs called for creating a domestic processing centre. The relevant law was adopted but processing operations were not transferred to Russia despite the risk of losing access to international payment systems for Russian banks. This is precisely what happened on March 21, 2014 when Visa and MasterCard, both headquartered in the United States, suspended operations for several Russian banks.

The blocking of access to the SWIFT inter-bank payment system makes online payments in any currency, except the national one, impossible.

Kiev did not take any steps towards fulfilling the Geneva agreements set during four-party talks between Russia, Ukraine, the EU, and the US on April 17, Russia’s envoy to the UN Vitaly Churkin said, adding that the West did not help either.

“Nothing has been done on behalf of Kiev’s authorities to
  implement the Geneva document. Our Western colleagues, primarily
  the Americans – who now have an unprecedented influence over Kiev
  – could not or did not want to convince Kiev to fulfill its
  obligations under the Geneva agreement,” Churkin said during
  the UN Security Council meeting in New York on Tuesday.



  Addressing the meeting, US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power
  accused Russia of stirring up trouble in eastern Ukraine and
  undermining the government in Kiev.



  “Russia continues to fund, to coordinate, and to fuel the
  heavily-armed separatist movement, she said.



  Churkin denied the claims and added that if the situation in
  Ukraine deteriorates, the West should comprehend its level of
  responsibility in the matter.



  On April 17, Russia, the US, the EU, and Ukraine adopted a joint document on the de-escalation
  of the Ukraine crisis, calling for all illegal armed groups to
  lay down arms and for a wide amnesty for detained protesters.



  Churkin stated that none of the radical groups are laying down
  arms, including the far-right group Right Sector, which is
  “marching under the Nazi flags.”

“On the contrary, these groups have been granted legal
  status, and [have been] used to form the paramilitary battalions
  'Dnepr,' 'Slobozhanschina,' and ‘Donbass,'” he said.



  According to Churkin, Kiev’s Independence Square is still being
  occupied, even though that is in violation of one of the items in
  the Geneva agreements. “Nobody is vacating anything in Kiev,
  while Washington is complacently claiming that the buildings are
  being ‘legally rented out,’” he stated.



  The Russian envoy to the UN also highlighted that repressions
  against those disagreeing with Kiev’s coup-imposed authorities
  are continuing, adding that there has been no amnesty for
  arrested protesters.



  Churkin stated that the current Ukrainian regime, supported by
  the West, is pushing the country towards a catastrophe.



  He also criticized other states which have claimed that Russia is

  In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday claimed
  the US has been behind the Ukrainian crisis from the
  beginning, but was initially flying low. He added that if
  sanctions continue, Russia will have to reconsider who has access

“I think what is happening now shows us who really was

  the United States preferred to remain in the shadow,” Putin
  said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.","Kiev did nothing to fulfill Geneva agreements – Russia’s UN envoy

Kiev did not take any steps towards fulfilling the Geneva agreements set during four-party talks between Russia, Ukraine, the EU, and the US on April 17, Russia’s envoy to the UN Vitaly Churkin said, adding that the West did not help either.

“Nothing has been done on behalf of Kiev’s authorities to
  implement the Geneva document. Our Western colleagues, primarily
  the Americans – who now have an unprecedented influence over Kiev
  – could not or did not want to convince Kiev to fulfill its
  obligations under the Geneva agreement,” Churkin said during
  the UN Security Council meeting in New York on Tuesday.



  Addressing the meeting, US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power
  accused Russia of stirring up trouble in eastern Ukraine and
  undermining the government in Kiev.



  “Russia continues to fund, to coordinate, and to fuel the
  heavily-armed separatist movement, she said.



  Churkin denied the claims and added that if the situation in
  Ukraine deteriorates, the West should comprehend its level of
  responsibility in the matter.



  On April 17, Russia, the US, the EU, and Ukraine adopted a joint document on the de-escalation
  of the Ukraine crisis, calling for all illegal armed groups to
  lay down arms and for a wide amnesty for detained protesters.



  Churkin stated that none of the radical groups are laying down
  arms, including the far-right group Right Sector, which is
  “marching under the Nazi flags.”

“On the contrary, these groups have been granted legal
  status, and [have been] used to form the paramilitary battalions
  'Dnepr,' 'Slobozhanschina,' and ‘Donbass,'” he said.



  According to Churkin, Kiev’s Independence Square is still being
  occupied, even though that is in violation of one of the items in
  the Geneva agreements. “Nobody is vacating anything in Kiev,
  while Washington is complacently claiming that the buildings are
  being ‘legally rented out,’” he stated.



  The Russian envoy to the UN also highlighted that repressions
  against those disagreeing with Kiev’s coup-imposed authorities
  are continuing, adding that there has been no amnesty for
  arrested protesters.



  Churkin stated that the current Ukrainian regime, supported by
  the West, is pushing the country towards a catastrophe.



  He also criticized other states which have claimed that Russia is
  not doing its part to influence protesters in southeastern
  Ukraine. “How can you convince the militias in the east of
  the country to disarm or leave the buildings if they are
  surrounded, like in Slavyansk, by Ukrainian armed forces and the

The U.S. president's comments came against the backdrop of tensions between the Philippines and an increasingly powerful China over remote uninhabited islands in the South China Sea.

Our commitment to defend the Philippines is ironclad and the United States will keep that commitment because allies never stand alone, Obama said.

Sweating profusely in an unairconditioned gymnasium packed with U.S. and Filipino soldiers, veterans and their families, the president said joint U.S.-Filipino rescue efforts after November's Typhoon Yolanda were the modern-day version of the bravery shown by both country's troops during World War Two.

The military agreement between the two countries was the centerpiece of Obama's first visit to the Philippines, the United States' oldest ally in the region.

The deal, which will have an initial 10-year term, sets the framework for a beefed-up rotation of U.S. troops, ships and warplanes through the Philippines.

Obama said the accord and his visit - part of a four-nation swing through Asia - demonstrated the U.S. commitment to a rebalancing of resources and diplomacy towards the fast-growing region.

That commitment has been in doubt as the United States has focused on conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan.

Deepening our alliance is part of our broader vision for the Asia Pacific, Obama said.

The U.S. president further stressed solidarity with the Philippines as Manila seeks international arbitration over disputed islands in a tense standoff with Beijing.

International law must be upheld. Freedom of navigation must be preserved, Obama said. Disputes must be resolved peacefully and not by intimidation or by force.

China claims most of the South China Sea, but the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims to parts of those waters.

Earlier this month, a small Philippine government ship needed to evade a blockade of Chinese coastguard vessels to deliver food, water and fresh troops to a disputed shoal in the Spratly Islands.

The Philippines is seeking United Nations arbitration challenging China's nine-dash-line that stretches deep into the South China Sea and the maritime heart of Southeast Asia.

In the sweltering Fort Bonifacio gymnasium on Tuesday, the U.S. president peeled off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves to speak, apologizing to the assembled uniform-clad troops for doing so but promising to make his remarks brief.

Afterwards, he shook hands with troops and veterans, posing for a selfie photo with the family of one of the Filipino veterans.

The president later toured and laid a wreath at the U.S. military cemetery in Manila, where both U.S. and Filipino soldiers are buried. The cemetery contains more than 17,000 graves of U.S. service members who died during World War Two, the largest such cemetery anywhere in the world.

Ukraine irreparably severs Geneva accord – Kremlin

By unleashing a ‘punitive operation’ in eastern Ukraine, Kiev has destroyed the last vestige of hope for implementing the Geneva agreement on de-escalating the Ukrainian crisis, Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.


  While Russia is making efforts to de-escalate and resolve
  the conflict, the Kiev regime has chosen military aviation
  strikes on peaceful residential areas and started a punitive
  operation, literally destroying the last hope for the viability
  of the Geneva accords,” Dmitry Peskov said.



  Peskov said the Russian president was closely following the
  events in eastern Ukraine. He gave a reminder that Putin had
  earlier described the possibility of any such operation as a
  “criminal action.”



  “Unfortunately, the latest developments prove the assessment
  was right,” Peskov said.



  Later, speaking on Rossiya-24 TV, Putin’s spokesman said Moscow
  was waiting for Western countries to react to the military
  operation in Slavyansk.



  “We are calling on the European capitals, the United States
  of America to give an assessment of the current events and are of
  course calling on those carrying out airstrikes on residential
  areas to change their mind.”



  Russia’s Foreign Ministry demanded Ukraine “to immediately
  end the punitive operation and any violence against its own
  people, to release political prisoners and to ensure journalists
  can carry out their work freely.” The Ministry’s statement,
  released on Friday, also urges foreign countries to refrain from
  interfering in events in Ukraine.



  Putin’s special representative, Vladimir Lukin, was earlier sent
  to eastern Ukraine to help conduct negotiations on the release of
  the foreign observers held hostage by anti-government protesters.



  “Following the start of the punitive operation, the Russian
  side has lost all contact with Lukin,” Putin’s spokesman
  said.



  RIA Novosti later managed to get through to Lukin’s assistant
  Natalia Mirze, who reassured that everything was fine with the
  special representative.



  Peskov said Kremlin was also “extremely worried” by the
  fact that Russian and foreign journalists were in the “zone
  of the punitive operation.”



  We, of course, demand measures to be taken for ensuring
  their security,” Peskov added.



  Online media outlet, Donbass News, has announced that contact was
  lost with SkyNews and CBS crew, working in eastern Ukraine. The
  news website has given the names of the currently missing
  journalists: Clarissa Ward, Erin Lyall, Andy Srevenson and Geoff
  Mabberley.



  Also on Friday, there was news of contact being lost with a
  Buzzfeed journalist, Mike Giglio and his interpreter. One of the
  messages from Giglio read, “We were captured at the
  checkpoint.” Later, Donbass News reported that Giglio and
  his interpreter were freed.



  The Ukrainian army began a special operation against
  anti-government activists in the eastern town of Slavyansk on
  Friday morning. The city was blockaded by the Ukrainian military,
  with 20 helicopters reportedly deployed to crack down on
  self-defense forces.



  The military operation has resulted in three casualties. Two
  Ukrainian pilots died, after their helicopters were shot down,
  according to the Defense Ministry.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the overture on Sunday, saying Abbas's Palestinian power-sharing deal with Hamas, which led Israel to suspend the negotiations on Thursday, put him in partnership with an Islamist group that denies the Holocaust and seeks the Jewish state's destruction.

What I say to him very simply is this: President Abbas, tear up your pact with Hamas, Netanyahu said on the CBS news program Face the Nation.

Abbas's message, published in Arabic and English by the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, coincided with Israel's annual remembrance day for the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, and included an expression of sympathy for the families of the victims.

What happened to the Jews in the Holocaust is the most heinous crime to have occurred against humanity in the modern era, WAFA quoted Abbas as saying at a meeting a week ago with an American rabbi.

By speaking in superlative terms, Abbas could risk a backlash from Palestinians who draw comparisons between their suffering at the hands of Israeli occupiers and that of Jews under Hitler's Third Reich.

Abbas has condemned the mass killings of Jews in World War Two before and challenged allegations, stemming from a 1983 book he authored, that he is a Holocaust denier.

But the timing of the publication of his latest comments gave them extra significance, a day after he signaled he remained committed to the peace talks and said a future Palestinian unity government would recognize Israel.

SHOCKED

On CBS, Netanyahu said he and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry were both shocked to learn last Wednesday of the reconciliation agreement between Hamas and Abbas's Palestine Liberation Organization.

The peace negotiations, championed by Kerry, were facing an April 29 deadline, with little public sign the two sides were making progress toward a U.S.-mediated deal to extend the talks.

Netanyahu said in the TV interview, however, that he had negotiated in earnest for nine months, working closely with Kerry, and we made some significant progress.

Palestinian officials have blamed Netanyahu for the peace impasse, noting he failed to carry out a pledged release of Palestinian prisoners and citing Israeli announcements of further construction in settlements in the occupied West Bank.

Netanyahu has said Abbas's refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state blocked progress in talks aimed at ending decades of conflict and creating a Palestinian state.

The Palestinian unity accord followed seven years of failed reconciliation attempts after Hamas seized the Gaza Strip from forces loyal to Abbas in 2007.

The agreement envisages the formation of a Palestinian government of non-political technocrats within five months and new elections six months later.

On CBS, Netanyahu said Abbas cannot embrace Hamas and say that he wants peace with Israel. In a separate interview with CNN, Netanyahu reiterated he would never negotiate with a Palestinian government backed by Hamas, a group that both Israel and the United States regard as a terrorist organization.

Hamas officials were not immediately available to comment on Netanyahu's Holocaust-denial accusations.

But in an open letter to a senior U.N. official in 2009, Hamas branded the Holocaust a lie invented by the Zionists. Hamas was protesting U.N. plans at the time to start Holocaust studies for children in Gaza.

Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial, gave a guarded welcome to Abbas's statement on Sunday.

Holocaust denial and revisionism are sadly prevalent in the Arab world, including among Palestinians, Yad Vashem said. Thus the statement, that the Holocaust is the most heinous crime to have occurred against humanity in the modern era, coming from Abbas, might signal a change.

Obama's visit to Malaysia follows his swing through Japan, where he failed to clinch a trade deal key to the U.S. rebalancing back to Asia. Such a deal would have injected momentum into the delayed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact.

Najib's ambition to bring Malaysia into Obama's flagship trade plan has been undercut by the resurgent influence of traditionalists within his own ruling party following a weak election showing last year.

Early this month, a Malaysian cabinet minister was reported as saying the country was a long way from being able to sign a TPP deal and that the priority should be on economic integration within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc.

Najib said Malaysia was committed to free trade and denied that Washington was bullying the Southeast Asian nation into joining the controversial pact.

We are working around the sensitivities and challenges which I alluded to in my discussions with President Obama, Najib told a joint news conference with the U.S. leader in the administrative capital of Putrajaya.

He fully understands our domestic sensitivities and we will sit down and try to iron this out with the intention of trying to work out a deal in the near future.

Obama said that domestic opposition to trade deals wasn't surprising and that the United States was willing to be flexible on particularly sensitive areas, such as prices of life-saving medicines that critics say will jump in countries like Malaysia under the TPP.

There's never been a trade deal in which somebody's not going to at some point object because they're fearful of the future or they're invested in the status quo, Obama said.

Protesters briefly disrupted Obama's talk later in the day at a town hall-style meeting with young Malaysians at a university, holding up anti-TPP signs before being ushered away by security.

PEACEFUL RISE FOR CHINA

The challenge for Obama during his week-long, four-nation regional tour is to convince Asian partners that Washington is serious about its promised strategic pivot to increase U.S. influence in Asia, without harming U.S. ties with China, the world's second-biggest economy and a growing maritime power.

In his town hall speech, the Hawaiian-born president who lived in Indonesia as a boy told his audience that the United States has long had connections across the Pacific as well as the Atlantic.

He told students he plans to meet every year with the leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and would work through the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) to build trade ties.

We want to work with old allies and worthy partners and with China, he said. We want to see a peaceful rise to China.

Najib announced that he had agreed with Obama to upgrade the two countries' ties to a comprehensive partnership, mirroring a step that Malaysia took with China last year when President Xi Jinping made a state visit.

This marks a new phase in our relationship, with greater collaboration in economy, security, education, science, technology and more, Najib said.

Human rights groups and members of Malaysia's opposition alliance have urged Obama to speak out on what they say has been a sharp deterioration in religious and political freedoms since the ruling coalition suffered its election setback last May.

Since then, the government has reinstated detention without trial as part of a package of tougher crime laws and renewed what critics call a campaign of judicial persecution against opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.

In March, a court convicted Anwar on a charge of sodomy and sentenced him to five years in prison. The verdict came days before he was to stand in an election seen as paving the way for him to take charge of Malaysia's richest state.

Asked why he would not be meeting Anwar on his three-day visit to Malaysia, Obama said it was not indicative of a lack of concern and that Malaysia had work to do on allowing more freedoms. Obama was due to meet civil society leaders later on Sunday.

Najib said he was committed to the rule of law and civil liberties, but that he had to take account complex racial sensitivities in the multi-ethnic nation of 29 million people, where majority ethnic Malays enjoy special rights.

We have to manage that and that's exactly what Malaysia has done and because of that we are a relatively peaceful, harmonious nation, Najib said.

Russia, Ukraine, and the European Union failed to reach an agreement on gas supply issues during three-party talks in Warsaw on Friday. Kiev vowed to fulfill its gas transit obligations, but did not say when it plans to repay debt to Russia’s Gazprom.


  According to EU energy commissioner Guenther Oettinger, the sides
  have agreed to hold two more rounds of consultations, in two and
  four weeks. During their next meeting in mid-May, the sides will
  focus on gas prices for Ukraine, Oettinger told journalists on
  Friday.



  Moscow, Kiev, and Brussels gathered in Warsaw to search for a
  solution to the “crisis situation” around Ukraine's
  payments for Russian gas, the Russian Energy Ministry said
  earlier.



  Ukraine's debt to Russian energy giant Gazprom has already
  reached US$3.5 billion, but the sides have so far failed to come
  to a compromise over the price that Ukraine should pay for the
  natural gas supplies.



  “Our Ukrainian colleagues did not say anything about when
  they would pay for the gas they already received and they will
  receive later,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak told
  journalists after the Warsaw talks.



  “Today, we took a decision that Gazprom will not demand
  advance payment in April,” he said, as quoted by Itar-Tass.
  “May 16 is the date when a bill for gas supplies in June will
  be issued. They will have a time span until May 31 to pay it. If
  the bill is not paid by that date, Gazprom will have a
  possibility to limit gas supplies or to supply as much gas as is
  paid for until May 31.”



  The head of the Russian delegation also noted that Ukraine has
  received $3.2 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
  as part of a $17 billion loan package and could use the money to
  pay its debt.



  Ukraine’s energy minister, Yury Prodan, argued that the IMF loan
  will “switch on” the country’s economy and help it to grow.



  “Then gas consumption will increase and the ability to pay
  for the gas will grow,” Prodan said. State-owned energy
  company Naftogaz will get “balanced financing, and there will
  be very possibility to pay for gas that Ukraine receives from
  external sources,” he added.



  At the same time, Kiev is set to seek a reduction of price for
  Russian gas since it is not able to pay the current rate.



  “We are unable to pay almost $500 per 1,000 cubic
  meters,” Prodan said. The Ukrainian side has repeatedly
  asked the Russian side to return to the price of $268 per 1,000
  cubic meters. Ukraine has agreed to repay its debts at this
  price.”



  If an agreement on the matter is not reached at three-party
  consultations, Kiev will take the case to court, the Ukrainian
  energy official stated. He assured, though, that his country will
  fulfill its liabilities regarding the transit of Russian gas
  through Ukrainian territory to European countries.



  Prodan observed, however, that there is no guarantee of stable
  payments from Kiev even at a price of $268, since “Ukraine
  has not paid a single dollar” toward its March payment, when
  the lower price was still valid.



  Novak believes the issue should be solved in “a civilized way” –
  either based on mutual agreement or through a court.



  EU official Oettinger said there are no doubts that Ukraine does
  have gas debts. However, the total of that debt is subject to
  discussion. He added that the European Commission intends to give
  financial support to Naftogaz and act as a mediator in
  Russia-Ukraine gas price talks.



  Europe wants uniform gas price



  All European Union member states should pay the same price for
  imported Russian natural gas, while common European gas
  infrastructure should also include Ukraine, Georgia, and the
  western Balkans, Oettinger said ahead of Friday's three-party
  talks.



  “We want a uniform gas price in the European common
  market,” Oettinger said, as quoted by Reuters. “The game
  of [divide and rule], or a game of this type proposed by Moscow
  cannot be and will not be accepted by EU member states,” he
  said following a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk,
  who promotes the idea of an EU energy union and joint purchase of
  Russian gas.



  Currently, EU members buy Russian gas based on bilateral
  contracts, and prices vary.



  “We have very big differences in terms of gas prices. The
  higher the share of Russian gas in purchases and the bigger
  monopoly Russia has in supplies, the higher the prices are,”
  Oettinger said.



  Ukraine welcomed the idea of introducing a single price, Prodan
  said.



  From April, the price for Russian gas to Ukraine has jumped to
  $485 per cubic meter. That followed the cancellation of two
  discounts it previously received. The first one followed a
  December deal, when Moscow offered Ukraine’s Yanukovich-led
  government a $15 billion loan and a 33 percent discount on
  natural gas – a lifeline to help its faltering economy. The
  natural gas discount was subject to review each financial
  quarter.



  The other discount was based on a 2010 agreement, under which
  Russia guaranteed its neighbor a $100 per 1,000 cubic meter gas
  discount in return for using the Sevastopol port to host its
  Black Sea Fleet. The discount was canceled after the agreement
  was denounced.



  In the winters of 2006 and 2009, Moscow cut off gas transit
  through Ukraine to Europe over unpaid bills to Gazprom, which
  left parts of Europe without heat. Russia claims Ukraine
  illegally siphoned off supplies intended for Europe during that
  time. Ukraine denies the accusation.","Russia, EU, Ukraine fail to reach agreement at gas talks

Thousands of trade unionists marched with Russian flags and those of Putin's ruling United Russia party onto the giant square beneath the Kremlin walls, past the red granite mausoleum of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin.

Many banners displayed traditional slogans for the annual workers' holiday, such as Peace, Labour, May. But others were more directly political, alluding to the crisis in Ukraine where Russia's annexation of Crimea in March precipitated the biggest confrontation with the West since the Cold War.

I am proud of my country, read one banner. Putin is right, said another.

In eastern Ukraine, where a number of government buildings have been seized by armed groups seeking union with Russia, the security situation deteriorated further.

Separatists stormed the prosecutor's office in the city of Donetsk, throwing rocks, firecrackers and teargas at riot police defending officials they accused of working for the Western-backed government in Kiev.

Rebels in the city, capital of a province of about 4 million people, have declared a People's Republic of Donetsk and called a referendum on secession for May 11, undercutting a planned presidential election in Ukraine two weeks later.

Ukraine's leaders - who came to power in February when the previous Moscow-backed president was toppled after months of protests - conceded on Wednesday they were helpless to counter the fall of government buildings and police stations in the Donbass coal and steel belt, source of around a third of the country's industrial output.

The International Monetary Fund warned that if Ukraine lost territory in the east it would have to redesign a $17 billion bailout of the country, probably requiring additional financing.

Having seized buildings in the capital of the easternmost province, Luhansk, on Tuesday, gunmen took control at dawn on Wednesday in the nearby towns of Horlivka and Alchevsk.

DIPLOMAT EXPELLED

Citing the situation in the east, acting Ukrainian President Oleksander Turchinov signed a decree reinstating compulsory military service for men aged between 18 and 25.

The Kiev government, along with its Western allies, accuses Moscow of orchestrating the uprising. The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and involvement in eastern Ukraine.

Russia denies having any part in the rebellion, but has warned it reserves the right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians and has massed tens of thousands of troops on its western frontier with Ukraine.

The U.S. and EU sanctions, while not hitting Russian industry directly, have hurt the economy by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The IMF cut its outlook for Russian economic growth this year to just 0.2 percent on Wednesday and said Russia was already experiencing recession.

U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa said its Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld had canceled plans to attend Putin's St. Petersburg International Economic Forum later this month. A company spokesman confirmed that U.S. officials had urged Alcoa not to send its top executive.

Kiev ordered the expulsion of Russia's military attach?© on Thursday, saying it had caught him red-handed receiving classified information from a colonel in Ukraine's armed forces on the country's cooperation with NATO.

A spokeswoman for Ukraine's security service, the SBU, said the attach?© had been handed over to the Russian embassy and ordered to leave, though she was not sure if he had left yet.

In Moscow, Putin, unlike Soviet-era leaders, did not personally preside at the parade from atop Lenin's mausoleum. But he carried out another tradition from those days by awarding Hero of Labour medals to five workers at a ceremony in the Kremlin. He revived the Stalin-era award a year ago.

Putin has described the break-up of the Soviet Union as a tragedy and overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy in March by declaring Moscow's right to intervene in former Soviet republics to protect Russian speakers.

NATO said on Thursday it was looking at ways to bring former Soviet state Georgia, which Russia invaded in 2008, even closer to the military alliance. Russian forces defend two breakaway Georgian regions, comprising a fifth of its territory.

James Appathurai, NATO Special Representative for the Caucasus, said he would not let Russia's words or actions influence the final decision on whether to make Georgia a full member. Moscow strongly opposes Georgia joining NATO.

Last week France and Germany assured Georgia that a deal bringing it closer to the EU would be sealed soon.

Romania, a former member of the Soviet bloc that now belongs to NATO, called on Thursday for the United States and the Western alliance to boost their military presence in the country. This would promote stability in the Black Sea region and deter any other destabilizing initiatives, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

PATRIOTIC UPLIFT

Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Rossiya 24 TV that more than 100,000 people had marched through Red Square. This is not by chance, because there is a patriotic uplift and a good mood in the country, he said from the square.

Russian television also showed footage of a May Day parade in Crimea's capital Simferopol, with Russian flags and banners reading Crimea is Russia. Welcome home.

We are sure that the current patriotic uplift in Crimea will spill over into the whole Russian Federation, Interfax news agency quoted Crimea's pro-Moscow leader Sergei Aksyonov as telling journalists.

The intervention in Ukraine has been enormously popular in Russia. One opinion poll on Wednesday showed 82 percent support for Putin, his highest rating since 2010.

Western sanctions won't affect us. Crimea was historically part of Russia, and it's only right that we've become whole again, said Tatyana Ivanova, a worker from Moscow Housebuilding Factory No. 1 celebrating May Day with four colleagues.

Putin has also revived the Soviet-era practice of staging massive displays of military firepower on Red Square to mark May 9, the anniversary of the allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two and one of the most important days in the Soviet and Russian calendars.

Central Moscow streets have been partially closed in recent days as tanks and mobile rocket launchers rehearse for that parade next week.

James Appathurai, NATO Special Representative for the Caucasus, said he would not let Russia's words or actions influence the final decision on whether to make Georgia a full member. Moscow strongly opposes Georgia joining NATO.

Last week France and Germany assured Georgia that a deal bringing it closer to the EU would be sealed soon.

Romania, a former member of the Soviet bloc that now belongs to NATO, called on Thursday for the United States and the Western alliance to boost their military presence in the country. This would promote stability in the Black Sea region and deter any other destabilizing initiatives, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

PATRIOTIC UPLIFT

Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Rossiya 24 TV that more than 100,000 people had marched through Red Square. This is not by chance, because there is a patriotic uplift and a good mood in the country, he said from the square.

Russian television also showed footage of a May Day parade in Crimea's capital Simferopol, with Russian flags and banners reading Crimea is Russia. Welcome home.

We are sure that the current patriotic uplift in Crimea will spill over into the whole Russian Federation, Interfax news agency quoted Crimea's pro-Moscow leader Sergei Aksyonov as telling journalists.

The intervention in Ukraine has been enormously popular in Russia. One opinion poll on Wednesday showed 82 percent support for Putin, his highest rating since 2010.

Western sanctions won't affect us. Crimea was historically part of Russia, and it's only right that we've become whole again, said Tatyana Ivanova, a worker from Moscow Housebuilding Factory No. 1 celebrating May Day with four colleagues.

Putin has also revived the Soviet-era practice of staging massive displays of military firepower on Red Square to mark May 9, the anniversary of the allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two and one of the most important days in the Soviet and Russian calendars.

Central Moscow streets have been partially closed in recent days as tanks and mobile rocket launchers rehearse for that parade next week.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will discuss on Tuesday with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko issues of bilateral trade and economic cooperation as well as the current developments in Ukraine, Putin’s presidential aide Yury Ushakov said.

President Putin is paying a visit to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, on Tuesday to take part in a session of the High Eurasian Economic Council at a level of the leaders of member states and will hold a bilateral meeting with Lukashenko after the session.

“Putin and Lukashenko are set to discuss key international issues, which include the current situation in Ukraine, as well as the joint work on the future development of the CIS [the Commonwealth of Independent States] considering Minsk’s chairmanship in this organization for the second year’s run,” Ushakov said.

The situation in Ukraine is far from stable after a coup in February, which brought to power new people amid deadly riots as President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave the country citing security concerns.

After Crimea's accession to Russia, which Kiev and Western countries do not accept despite Russia’s repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law, protests against the new Kiev leaders erupted in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking south-eastern regions. Demonstrators, who are demanding referendums on the country’s federalization, took control of some government buildings.

Ushakov also said that during the meeting, “the presidents will particularly focus on important issues concerning the bilateral trade and economic cooperation.”

Belarus is in the fifth place of Russia’s world trade partners and is in the first place among the CIS member states. Last year bilateral trade reached $39.7 billion, while this figure stood at $43.8 billion and $38.6 in 2012 and 2011 respectively.

Both countries are also actively cooperating with the frames of the Customs Union, which besides Russia and Belarus also enlists Kazakhstan as a member state in this organization, as well as within the frames of the Common Economic Space.

This will be Putin’s fourth meeting with Lukashenko starting this year.

The EU is responsible for “the mess” in Ukraine, Geert Wilders, Holland's Party for Freedom leader,  told RT.  Wilders wonders why the bloc has got involved in a country where half the population is against joining Europe.

Watch the full interview here


  Wilders, who was speaking exclusively on RT’s SophieCo, believes
  the EU should have kept out of the conflict and only made things
  worse by giving the country hopes of a pre-accession treaty to
  the union, when the people of Ukraine were not in unison about
  joining the organization.


“It was a very delicate balance in Ukraine with 50 percent
  looking eastwards, towards Russia, and 50 percent of the
  population looking westwards, towards the European Union. So I
  think it was very irresponsible what the EU did; they should have
  kept out of it,” Wilders said.



  The leader of the right-wing Party for Freedom criticized politicians
  from Europe, the US and from his home country for appearing in
  Kiev and giving the impression that Ukraine had the complete
  support of the West while completely ignoring the fact that
  Ukraine remains a very complex situation.


“I believe Europe was more thinking about itself and
  expanding it and its territory than really thinking about the
  whole of Ukraine, let alone the stability in that region.”


  Wilders admits he understands the gripes of those living in the
  east of the country, who were unhappy when the coup-appointed
  government took power in Kiev. “The best thing to do is to
  de-escalate by taking the Russian minority in eastern Ukraine
  seriously; give them rights and make them really feel as
  important as the other half of Ukraine,” the 50 year-old
  Eurosceptic continued.



  The Dutch politician says Russia is also partly to blame and that
  retaining the territorial integrity of Ukraine is of the utmost
  importance.


“I’m not only blaming the EU, I’m blaming both Russia and the
  EU. But I have to be honest, the European Union made a terrible
  move in the beginning of November last year, and they at least
  partially started a lot of the troubles, and that analysis is
  shared by more parties in the EU for sure,” said the leader
  of the Party for Freedom.



  The US and the EU recently introduced more economic sanctions
  against Russia as they believe the country is having a
  destabilizing effect on Ukraine. However, Wilders says this will
  help neither the Russians nor the EU and cannot have a
  “positive effect.”


  Wilders has achieved success in his native Netherlands on a
  ticket of euro skepticism and is adamant that his
  country should leave the EU. “We can deal better economically
  when we are in charge of our country, again, when it comes to
  national sovereignty – so, yes, we would like to leave the EU and
  be stronger as a national country,” the Dutchman said.



  Wilders cites the example of Switzerland, as a model that his
  country could follow, with the Alpine nation being one of the
  richest on the continent, despite never having joined the EU.


“We lost our identity; we lost our national sovereignty to
  the EU, an institution that really a lot of people in the West
  don’t like so much anymore. I have nothing against Europe, but I
  have a lot against the EU as an organization,” Wilders
  concluded.

Right now, that problem appears especially acute: Sanctions seem to be the main, if not only, Western weapon for dealing with Russian aggression in Ukraine. Just Monday, the United States announced sanctions on those individuals close to President Vladimir Putin, part of a broader campaign of targeted visa bans and asset freezes on the Russian elite over Russia's actions in Ukraine. However, the success of the sanctions already in place is proving hard to ascertain: As Russia’s deputy prime minister said of the last round of U.S. efforts: Send me your teeth ground in impotent rage.

So when have economic sanctions actually worked? One of the best known investigations of that question is Economic Sanctions Reconsidered, first published in 1985, by Gary Clyde Hufbauer, Jeffrey J. Schott, Kimberly Ann Elliott. That book, now on its third edition (from 2009), attempts to access the aims and success of every economic sanction for which it can find data.

According to the latest edition, the sanctions listed below are the only instances from 1914 to 2008 in which not only was the stated goal of the measures reached, but the sanctions themselves were instrumental in achieving that goal – thus receiving a full rating of 16 out of 16.

It isn't a long list, and many of the entries are a little obscure. Where possible, the cost to the nation targeted has been included:

1921: the League of Nations vs. Yugoslavia

In 1921, the League of Nations threatened economic sanctions against Yugoslavia if it attempted to seize land from Albania. Yugoslavia backed down.

1925: the League of Nations vs. Greece

Four years later, the League of Nations threatened sanctions against Greece unless it withdrew from Bulgaria's border territory. Greece withdrew.

1948-1949: the United States vs. Netherlands

As the Dutch East Indies struggled to become an independent Indonesia after World War II, the United States suspended the Marshall Plan aid to authorities in the region after the Dutch arrested Indonesian leaders. After threats of sanctions, the Dutch agreed to Indonesian independence in 1949. The sanctions cost 1.1% of the Dutch gross national product.

1958-1959: the U.S.S.R. vs. Finland

During the Night Frost Crisis of 1958 and 1959, Finnish-Soviet relations were fraught after the Communists were excluded from government and Karl-August Fagerholm, viewed as unfavorable to the Soviets, was appointed as prime minister. The U.S.S.R. used economic sanctions to force Fagerholm's resignation. The sanctions cost 1.1.% of the Finnish GNP.

1961-1965: the United States vs. Ceylon (Sri Lanka)

Between 1961 and 1965, the United States applied sanctions against the Dominion of Ceylon (what is now Sri Lanka) after the socialist government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike was accused of expropriating the assets of U.S. and British oil companies. The government fell in 1965, largely because of the economic effects of these sanctions, which cost 0.6% of the the country's GNP.

1965-1967: the United States vs. India

In 1965, the United States canceled food and military aid to India in a bid to force it to change its agricultural policies and to voice displeasure over its war with Pakistan earlier that year. In 1966, Indira Gandhi's government proposed new agricultural policies, and U.S. aid resumed the next year. The economic cost was 0.08% of the Indian GNP.

1975-1976: the United States vs. South Korea

In 1975, the United States used the threat of sanctions to discourage South Korea from buying a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant from France, which the U.S. thought might be secretly used to help make nuclear bombs. South Korea never bought the plant.

1976-1977: the United States vs. Taiwan

In 1976, the United States learned that Taiwan was secretly developing nuclear weapons, so the United States delayed its export of nuclear material to the country. Taiwan later announced that it was abandoning its plans. The estimated economic cost was 0.1% of Taiwan's GNP.

1982-1986: South Africa vs. Lesotho

South Africa applied economic pressure on Lesotho to make it return South African refugees with links to the African National Congress. After a military coup in Lesotho, South Africa lifted a blockade on the landlocked nation, and 60 ANC members were deported back home. The cost was estimated to be 5.1% of Lesotho's GNP.

1987-1988: the United States vs. El Salvador

In 1988, the United States used economic sanctions to block El Salvador from releasing those accused of killing U.S. citizens.

1992-1993: the United States vs. Malawi

The United States (and other nations) significantly cut aid in 1992 in a bid to improve the democratic standards and human rights situation in Malawi. Malawi was largely reliant on aid (the sanctions were estimated to cost 6.6% of its GNP) and swiftly adopted more open policies. After a referendum, multi-party democracy was introduced in 1993, and aid was soon resumed.

1993: the United States vs. Guatemala

In 1993, after President Jorge Serrano dissolved Congress and said he would rule by decree, the United States and European nations threatened sanctions. Business owners, scared of the economic effects, helped force Serrano out of power and installed a new president, Ramiro de Leon Carpio. The economic cost was said to be 1.3% of Guatemala's GDP.

1994-1995: Greece vs. Albania

Greece suspended European Union aid to Albania in 1994 after five members of an ethnic Greek group in the country were given prison terms. After this economic pressure (said to have cost Albania 2.9% of its GNP), Albania reduced the sentences and released two, and Greece resumed aid.

The authors of Economic Sanctions Reconsidered looked at more than 200 sets of sanctions, so this is not the most reassuring batting average. And it appears that many of the best-known sanctions, such as those against South Africa during apartheid, were probably not home runs. Some experts, such as the University of Chicago's Robert A. Pape, have argued that the definition of sanction used in the study is too broad, further weakening the success rate of such economic penalties.

There are some factors in the report's favor, however: There were other sanctions that appeared to work, of course (any sanction rated above 9 means that at least some aspect of the sanctioner's goals were achieved), plus we should remember that the list ends in 2008.

There's another confusing factor: Targeted sanctions, such as those used against Putin's allies, are a relatively new form of economic sanctions. They only emerged after the broader sanctions that we saw before the 1990s fell out of favor when the worrying humanitarian effects on Iraq were revealed.

The jury is still out on whether sanctions actually work. The early assessments of these targeted sanctions is that they are quite useful in signaling displeasure and as tangible signs of support for international norms, Kimberly Ann Elliott, one of the authors of Economic Sanctions Reconsidered, told me in an e-mail. Their utility in changing objectionable behavior is more questionable.

Fifty-five US colleges and universities are currently under investigation in connection with allegations that they mishandled or ignored sexual assault and sexual harassment complaints, the US Department of Education announced Thursday.


  A variety of schools – small, large, private, and public – are
  named on the list. Ohio State University, the University of
  California Berkeley, and Arizona State University are all
  included, listed alongside prestigious institutions like
  Princeton University, Dartmouth College, and Harvard University
  Law School.



  Women and advocates of sexual assault prevention have long
  criticized the Department of Education (DOE) for failing to
  adequately investigate what some have called an epidemic of
  sexual abuse on American campuses. Before Thursday’s announcement
  the department would only confirm if a school was under review
  upon request.



  The announcement comes days after the Obama administration issued
  recommendations on how to best curb the problem from a federal
  standpoint.



  The DOE announcement made it clear that authorities are
  investigating whether the 55 schools have violated Title IX of a
  1972 law which prohibits discrimination based on gender in all
  education programs and extracurricular activities that receive
  federal aid.



  “We are making this list available in an effort to bring more
  transparency to our enforcement work and to foster better public
  awareness of civil rights,” Assistant Secretary for Civil
  Rights Catherine E. Lhamon said in a statement to the Huffington Post. “We hope this increased
  transparency will spur community dialogue about this important
  issue. I also want to make it clear that a college or
  university’s appearance on this list and being the subject of a
  Title IX investigation in no way indicates at this stage that the
  college or university is violating or has violated the law.”



  Student activists throughout the country have repeatedly failed
  to convince the DOE to offer such a list, with a group called Ed
  Act Now denied in their request to have a complete list of
  schools under investigation in December. The pressure increased
  in January of this year, with a bipartisan group of 39
  congressional lawmakers co-signing a letter to the DOE to give
  the public more insight.



  “It shouldn’t be a guessing game if the Department of
  education has found a history of colleges and universities
  failing to respond to sexual violence,” wrote Representative
  Jackie Speier (D-California). “American families have a right
  to know when that history is present, and institutions should be
  held accountable for commitments they make to the federal
  government to stem the violence on their campuses.”



  The Title IX protection has a variety of applications; it is the
  same law that prohibits schools from gender discrimination in
  sports. Now, victims of sexual assault are using the law to try
  to compel schools to provide adequate protection.



  Little information is known about specific instances, although
  ESPN reported that the University of Michigan
  in Ann Arbor was accused of dropping the ball when investigating
  a student athlete. The school reportedly received complaints
  about Brendan Gibbons, a former kicker on Michigan’s football
  team, although it was a full year before Gibbons was expelled.



  University officials failed to explain the reasoning for the
  year-long lapse, according to ESPN, although spokesman Rick
  Fitzgerald said Michigan has been “fully cooperating”
  with the DOE probe.



  The White House, citing previous research studies, has said that
  approximately one in five female university students are
  assaulted, not accounting for students who never report being
  attacked.



  President Obama recently appointed a task force of Cabinet
  members charged with coming up with new ways for victims to
  report an assault without fear of retaliation. Recommendations
  included identifying confidential victims’ advocates and
  employing better surveys to examine the circumstances where
  sexual assault could be more likely.



  Activists say the biggest issue, though, is the DOE pulling the
  shroud away from what investigations were being conducted.



  “It’s a huge deal,” Caroline Heldman – chair of
  Occidental College’s politics department, who helped file
  complaints against the campus over its handling of sexual assault
  cases – told the Los Angeles Times. “It will inspire more
  survivor activists to file complaints when they see schools of
  every stripe in every part of the country have this
  problem.”



  If a school is deemed to have not complied with the law, the
  department could withhold federal funding, although it has yet to
  do so.","55 colleges under investigation for mishandling sexual assault

His comments drew a swift response from China, which said the disputed islets were Chinese territory.

Obama also urged Japan to take bold steps to clinch a two-way trade pact seen as crucial to a broad regional agreement that is a central part of the U.S. leader's pivot of military, diplomatic and economic resources towards Asia and the Pacific.

U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators failed to resolve differences in time for Obama and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to shake hands on a deal at the summit.

The leaders reported progress, but Japan's economics minister, Akira Amari, said later that remaining sticking points could not be resolved quickly.

Obama, on the start of a four-nation tour, is being treated to a display of pomp and ceremony meant to show that the U.S.-Japan alliance, the main pillar of America's security strategy in Asia, is solid at a time of rising tensions over growing Chinese assertiveness and North Korean nuclear threats.

We don't take a position on final sovereignty determinations with respect to Senkaku, but historically they have been administered by Japan and we do not believe that they should be subject to change unilaterally and what is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by Japan, Obama said.

This is not a new position, this is a consistent one, he told a joint news conference after his summit with Abe, using the Japanese name for the islands that China, which also claims sovereignty over them, calls the Diaoyu.

In our discussions, I emphasized with Prime Minister Abe the importance of resolving this issue peacefully, Obama added.

Whilst his comments amounted to a restatement of longstanding U.S. policy, there was symbolism in the commitment being stated explicitly by a U.S. president in Japan.

Responding to Obama's remarks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a daily press briefing in Beijing that the islands belonged to China.

The so-called U.S.-Japan security treaty is a product of the Cold War era and it cannot be aimed at a third party and ought not to harm China's territorial sovereignty, he said.

No matter what anyone says or does, it cannot change the basic reality that the Diaoyu Islands are China's inherent territory and cannot shake the resolve and determination of the Chinese government and people to protect (our) sovereignty and maritime rights.

INTERNATIONAL RULES

Obama also said there were opportunities to work with China - which complains that his real aim is to contain its rise - but called on the Asian power to stick to international rules.

What we've also emphasized, and I will continue to emphasize throughout this trip, is that all of us have responsibilities to help maintain basic rules of the world and international order, so that large countries, small countries, all have to abide by what is considered just and fair, he said.

Some of China's neighbors with territorial disputes with Beijing worry that Obama's apparent inability to rein in Russia, which annexed Crimea last month, could send a message of weakness to China.

Obama told the news conference that additional sanctions were teed up against Russia if it does not deliver on promises in an agreement reached in Geneva last week to ease tensions in Ukraine.

Obama and Abe also agreed that their top trade aides, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Amari, would keep trying to narrow gaps in their trade talks.

This is not something we can reach a conclusion (on) in a short period of time, Amari told reporters after meeting Froman again after the leaders' summit.

Abe has touted the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as key to the Third Arrow of his economic program to reinvigorate the world's third-biggest economy, along with hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending.

Both sides have also stressed that the TPP would have strategic implications by creating a framework for business that could entice China to play by global rules.

But the talks have been stymied by Japan's efforts to protect politically powerful agriculture sectors such as beef, and disputes over both countries' auto markets.

Pointing to restrictions on access to Japan's farm and auto sectors, Obama said: Those are all issues that people are all familiar with and at some point have to be resolved. I believe that point is now.

Experts had said failure to reach a final deal could cast doubts on Abe's commitment to economic reform and take the wind out of the sails of a drive for a broader TPP agreement.

If they don't show progress ... it will be harder to use TPP as a spur to reforms, said Robert Feldman, a managing director at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities in Tokyo. It gives the anti-reform forces aid and comfort.

DIPLOMATIC CHALLENGE

The diplomatic challenge for Obama during his week-long, four-nation regional tour is to convince Asian partners that Washington is serious about its promised strategic pivot, while at the same time not harming U.S. ties with China, the world's second-biggest economy.

Obama will also travel to South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Abe - who repeatedly referred to the U.S. president as Barack during their news conference - and Obama were keen to send a message of solidarity after U.S-Japan ties were strained by Abe's December visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, seen by critics as a symbol of Japan's past militarism.

Japan lobbied hard to get the White House to agree to an official state visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton in 1996.

Abe is trying to soothe U.S. concerns that his conservative push to recast Japan's war record with a less apologetic tone is overshadowing pragmatic policies on the economy and security.

Seventy years ago, when the war ended, Japan gave grave damage and pain to many people, particularly people in Asia. Japan started taking post-war steps by reflecting on this. Japan and Japanese people have continued to take the path of peace for the past 70 years, Abe told the joint news conference.

Japan has strived to create a free and democratic country after the war. We have been building a country that respects human rights and the rule of law, he said.

Gunmen who turned up at dawn took control of official buildings in Horlivka, a town of almost 300,000 people, said a Reuters photographer. They refused to be photographed.

The heavily armed men wore the same military uniforms without insignia as other unidentified green men who have joined pro-Russian protesters with clubs and chains in seizing control of towns across Ukraine's Donbass coal and steel belt.

Some 30 pro-Russian separatists also seized a city council building in Alchevsk, further east in Luhansk region, Interfax-Ukraine news agency said. They took down the Ukrainian flag and flew a city banner before allowing workers to leave.

Attempts to contain the insurgency by the government in Kiev have proved largely unsuccessful, with security forces repeatedly outmaneuvered by the separatists. The West and the new Ukrainian government accuse Russia of being behind the unrest, a charge Moscow denies.

Daniel Baer, the U.S. ambassador to the OSCE, a European security watchdog which has monitors in the region, told reporters in Vienna: I think it's very clear that what is happening would not be happening without Russian involvement.

A police official in Donetsk, the provincial capital where separatists have declared a People's Republic of Donetsk, said separatists were also in control of the Horlivka police station, having seized the regional police headquarters earlier in April.

The murder of a town councilor from Horlivka who opposed the separatists was cited by Kiev last week among reasons for launching new efforts to regain control of the region.

Wednesday's takeovers followed the fall of the main government buildings on Tuesday further east in Luhansk, capital of Ukraine's easternmost province, driving home just how far control over the densely populated region has slipped from the central government in Kiev.

They've taken them. The government administration and police, the police official said of Horlivka.

The town sits just north of Donetsk, unofficial capital of the whole Donbass area, where mainly Russian-speaking separatists have called a referendum on secession for May 11.

Many hope to follow Crimea's break from Ukraine in March and subsequent annexation by Russia, following the overthrow of Ukraine's Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in late February in a tug-of-war between the West and Russia over the strategic direction of the former Soviet republic.

The Donbass region is home to giant steel smelters and heavy plants that produce up to a third of Ukraine's industrial output. An armed uprising began there in early April, with Kiev almost powerless to respond for fear of provoking an invasion by tens of thousands of Russian troops massed on the border.

Many Russian-speaking business oligarchs from the Donbass backed Yanukovich and exercise great influence over the region.

On Wednesday, the most powerful of these, Ukraine's richest man Rinat Akhmetov issued a formal statement saying he remained committed to his investments in the Donbass and to keeping the region as part of Ukraine.

Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk warned his ministers their jobs were on the line if the east remained out of reach - The country demands action, he said.

Oleksander Turchinov, Ukraine's acting president until after an election on May 25, reiterated on Wednesday that police were incapable of reasserting control in the region and said the armed forces were on full alert for a Russian invasion.

That prompted a return volley from Moscow, where the Foreign Ministry demanded that Kiev immediately ceases the bellicose rhetoric, which is aimed at intimidating its own population.

There were, however, more conciliatory noises elsewhere.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not do stupid things in response to Western sanctions.

Describing a phone call between President Vladimir Putin and British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Kremlin said they agreed that only peaceful means could resolve the conflict - although Putin has shown little sign of backing down to sanctions.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she ruled out any military solution to the conflict over Ukraine, which is sandwiched between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO bloc:

Would we have learned anything 100 years after the start of World War One and 75 years after the start of World War Two if we resorted to the same methods? No, said Merkel, who will visit U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday. We will not resolve our conflicts in Europe with military means.

Military solutions can be excluded.

SANCTIONS COST

There were further signs on Monday that Russia is paying an economic price for its involvement in Ukraine. The International Monetary Fund said international sanctions imposed on Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine were hurting the economy.

The IMF cut its 2014 growth forecast for Russia to 0.2 percent from 1.3 percent and forecast capital outflows of $100 billion this year.

The IMF mission chief to Russia, Antonio Spilimbergo, also told reporters that Russia was experiencing recession and that a resolution of the Ukraine crisis would significantly reduce Russia's own economic uncertainties.

If you understand by recession two quarters of negative economic growth then Russia is experiencing recession now, Spilimbergo said.

Ukraine is also suffering from the turmoil, with economic output falling 1.1 percent year-on-year in the first three months of 2014, according to government figures released on Wednesday. Gazprom said Ukraine's unpaid bill for gas supplied by the Russian energy giant was now $3.5 billion.

However, the European Union said it was ready to provide economic aid to Ukraine along with the IMF, which on Wednesday approved a $17-billion aid package, including an immediate disbursement of $3.2 billion.

Gunmen who turned up at dawn took control of official buildings in Horlivka, a town of almost 300,000 people, said a Reuters photographer. They refused to be photographed.

The heavily armed men wore the same military uniforms without insignia as other unidentified green men who have joined pro-Russian protesters with clubs and chains in seizing control of towns across Ukraine's Donbass coal and steel belt.

Some 30 pro-Russian separatists also seized a city council building in Alchevsk, further east in Luhansk region, Interfax-Ukraine news agency said. They took down the Ukrainian flag and flew a city banner before allowing workers to leave.

Attempts to contain the insurgency by the government in Kiev have proved largely unsuccessful, with security forces repeatedly outmaneuvered by the separatists. The West and the new Ukrainian government accuse Russia of being behind the unrest, a charge Moscow denies.

Daniel Baer, the U.S. ambassador to the OSCE, a European security watchdog which has monitors in the region, told reporters in Vienna: I think it's very clear that what is happening would not be happening without Russian involvement.

A police official in Donetsk, the provincial capital where separatists have declared a People's Republic of Donetsk, said separatists were also in control of the Horlivka police station, having seized the regional police headquarters earlier in April.

The murder of a town councilor from Horlivka who opposed the separatists was cited by Kiev last week among reasons for launching new efforts to regain control of the region.

Wednesday's takeovers followed the fall of the main government buildings on Tuesday further east in Luhansk, capital of Ukraine's easternmost province, driving home just how far control over the densely populated region has slipped from the central government in Kiev.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was no logic in the West’s readiness to recognize elections in Ukraine without constitutional reform, while refusing to do the same in Syria.

“The Geneva communiqu? says that a transitional governing body should be created [in Syria], which will develop the constitutional reform as the basis for general elections. The same sequence of actions was stated in the agreement on Ukraine of February 21: at first a government of national unity, then constitutional reform and only then, after a new constitution, elections,” he said.

“The people who have come to power [in Ukraine] and declared themselves a government did not speak about constitutional reform at all in the beginning and said that presidential elections would be held on May 25. When we reminded them that constitutional reform was their obligation as well and that until they carry it out the east and the south would not recognize the legitimacy of what they were doing, they remembered their obligation but said they would do it later,” Lavrov said.

“The West believes that all this is absolutely legitimate. Those who said that the Syrian presidential elections would not be legitimate without constitutional reform have already practically recognized the legitimacy of the elections in Ukraine slated for May 25 without constitutional reform,” the minister said.

“Announcing elections before a consensus is reached with the east and south of Ukraine would be destructive for the country. They [the authorities] must prove with actions and do what they promised to do. They said constitutional reform would be carried out and the status of the Russian language would be discussed as the south-east is demanding, and they must start the process that will guarantee that all Ukrainian regions feel comfortable and know that they are heard and engaged in this process as equal parties,” Lavrov said.

Once this process is over, when the reform is ready, it must be submitted to a referendum, he said. “It makes no difference what it is called — federalization or decentralization,” the minister said, recalling US Secretary of State John Kerry’s remarks at a press conference in Geneva that Ukrainian regions would get autonomy.

“We want to be confident that the interests of the regions are taken into account, that they decide their own fate within the state that respects their interests regarding the language, culture, history, traditions, heroes and their right to interact with their foreign neighbors,” Lavrov said, noting that there were “very many inter-regional ties between Russia and Ukraine”.

Officials have vowed more punitive international actions targeting Russia's economy if Moscow, in their view, continues to aggravate the situation. Key Putin allies, high-profile Russian oligarchs and possibly Russian institutions and companies, will be targeted, CNN has been told.

Obama, at a news conference Friday in South Korea, said he would be talking to other European leaders about sanctions against Russia as the Ukraine crisis worsens.

The West has already introduced sanctions, imposing financial and visa restrictions on around 30 Russian and Ukrainian officials -- but stopping short of measures that would hit trade.

However, the uncertainty has fed capital flight, prompting Standard & Poor's to cut Russia's credit rating to one notch above junk. Hours later Russia raised its interest rates to limit the damage.

Ukraine hiked its bank rates on April in an attempts to protect its economy against the turmoil triggered by violent protests and Russia's military intervention in Crimea.

Russia is deeply integrated in the global economy, and links with the EU are particularly strong. Here's the background to Russia's relationship with the West.

How important is Russia's economy?

Russia is the eight biggest economy in the world, with GDP of more than $2 trillion. Its economy -- which is heavily reliant on commodities, particularly oil and gas -- is expected to grow only slightly in 2014 to around $2.4 trillion. Hopes it would be one of the decade's powerhouse economies have faded, with its GDP growing just 1.3% last year compared to 2012, one of the sharpest slowdowns in the emerging markets.

Russia boomed in the late 1990s and early 2000s as energy prices rose, then stumbled as demand for commodities contracted. But its energy supplies remain vitally important for the European Union, to which it supplies a third of its natural gas. Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia.

With the Ukraine crisis taking its toll, Russia's economy may not grow at all in 2014, some analysts have warned.

What is Russia's economic relationship with the U.S?

The economic relationship between Russia and the U.S. is unbalanced. Russia is the 20th largest trading partner for the U.S., with $27 billion worth of trade exported across the Atlantic. On the flip-side, the U.S. is Russia's fifth largest partner, with just $11 billion worth of trade.

According to Russian Foundation chair David Clark, trade is a relatively unimportant component of relations. Energy links are also weakening as the U.S. looks to shale gas for its energy supplies and heads towards self-sufficiency.

However, in March the U.S. State Department took its first step on sanctions, imposing a visa ban on Russian and Ukrainian officials and individuals responsible for, or complicit in threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. An expansion of the sanctions has been threatened.

What is Russia's economic relationship with the EU?

The EU is Russia's largest trading partner, and there are deep economic links between the two. Almost half of Russia's exports -- $292 billion worth -- end up in EU countries. Russia, in turn, is the third biggest trading partner for the EU, with $169 billion in imports.

The EU initially stepped more cautiously than the U.S. on sanctions. However, earlier this month, the EU said it would reinforce sanctions and target an additional four people in its sanctions. This will bring the total number of people subject to EU asset freezes to 22.

Members of the G8 have also said they will not attend a planned summit in Sochi this June, instead meeting in Brussels without Russia.

Meanwhile, the West has offered $16 billion in aid for Ukraine, helping the country prop up its ailing finances. The International Monetary Fund has also said Ukraine has $14 billion to $18 billion credit available if required.

Why did the U.S. and EU approach Russia differently?

The eurozone has only just emerged from its own crisis, and commentators say it could be wary of rapidly cutting ties with such a powerful economic partner. Its reliance on gas out of Russia would also feed caution. In contrast, the U.S. is weaning itself off Russia's energy supplies and its trade relationship is much less intertwined.

The first two waves of US troops have arrived in Poland and Latvia to begin military drills “promoting peace and stability” across Eastern Europe. Tensions continue to mount in the region, as Ukraine teeters on the brink of a civil war.


  A contingent of 150 American soldiers arrived in the Polish town
  of Swidwin on Thursday. Later in the evening another 150 US
  troops arrived in Riga, Latvian defence ministry confirmed. The
  two groups will be shortly joined by another 300 troops.



  The soldiers will participate in military exercises in Lithuania,
  Latvia and Estonia over the next three months, with a view to
  reassuring NATO allies in the region.



  Earlier the US embassy in Riga explained that a
  “company-sized contingent” of paratroopers from the U.S.
  Army Europe’s 173rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team is to take
  “part of a series of expanded US land force training
  activities in the Baltic region and Poland that are scheduled to
  take place for the next few months and beyond.”

“Through the troop deployment to Latvia the United States
  continues to demonstrate its commitment to NATO and to our
  collective defense responsibilities, by conducting additional
  military exercises, and enhancing security cooperation with its
  allies and partners in the Baltic and expanded region,” the
  embassy said.



  The US embassy in Latvia also claimed that US forces are prepared
  to use all of their capabilities “to reassure our Allies that
  we are prepared for any contingency to meet our Article 5
  obligations,” claiming that the brigade will stay in Latvia
  till the end of the year.



  Defense Department spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby, who
  announced the drills Tuesday, said they sent a clear message to
  Moscow.


If there's a message to Moscow, it is the same exact message
  that we take our obligations very, very seriously on the
  continent of Europe, Kirby told reporters. Washington has
  accused Russia of meddling in the affairs of neighboring Ukraine,
  which is currently embroiled in a crisis that shows no signs of
  de-escalation.



  Moscow categorically denies the accusations and says that
  Washington has orchestrated the unrest in Ukraine to further its
  geopolitical ambitions in the region. Russian Foreign Minister
  Sergey Lavrov told RT on Wednesday that “the Americans are
  running the show” and he denied claims of a Russian military
  presence in Ukraine.



  In addition, he said that the Russian troops massed along the
  Ukrainian border had been deployed for routine drills, something
  that has been verified by international inspectors.


“Ukraine is just one manifestation of the American
  unwillingness to yield in the geopolitical fight. Americans are
  not ready to admit that they cannot run the show in each and
  every part of the globe from Washington alone,” Lavrov said.



  In Ukraine, the coup-appointed government in Kiev re-launched an
  “anti-terror operation” in the east of the country after
  pledging to cease all violence at four-sided talks between the
  EU, the US, Russia and Ukraine in Geneva last week.



  Government tanks besieged the eastern city of Slavyansk on

The first two waves of US troops have arrived in Poland and Latvia to begin military drills “promoting peace and stability” across Eastern Europe. Tensions continue to mount in the region, as Ukraine teeters on the brink of a civil war.


  A contingent of 150 American soldiers arrived in the Polish town
  of Swidwin on Thursday. Later in the evening another 150 US
  troops arrived in Riga, Latvian defence ministry confirmed. The
  two groups will be shortly joined by another 300 troops.



  The soldiers will participate in military exercises in Lithuania,
  Latvia and Estonia over the next three months, with a view to
  reassuring NATO allies in the region.



  Earlier the US embassy in Riga explained that a
  “company-sized contingent” of paratroopers from the U.S.
  Army Europe’s 173rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team is to take
  “part of a series of expanded US land force training
  activities in the Baltic region and Poland that are scheduled to
  take place for the next few months and beyond.”

“Through the troop deployment to Latvia the United States
  continues to demonstrate its commitment to NATO and to our
  collective defense responsibilities, by conducting additional
  military exercises, and enhancing security cooperation with its
  allies and partners in the Baltic and expanded region,” the
  embassy said.



  The US embassy in Latvia also claimed that US forces are prepared
  to use all of their capabilities “to reassure our Allies that
  we are prepared for any contingency to meet our Article 5
  obligations,” claiming that the brigade will stay in Latvia
  till the end of the year.



  Defense Department spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby, who
  announced the drills Tuesday, said they sent a clear message to
  Moscow.


If there's a message to Moscow, it is the same exact message
  that we take our obligations very, very seriously on the
  continent of Europe, Kirby told reporters. Washington has
  accused Russia of meddling in the affairs of neighboring Ukraine,
  which is currently embroiled in a crisis that shows no signs of
  de-escalation.



  Moscow categorically denies the accusations and says that
  Washington has orchestrated the unrest in Ukraine to further its
  geopolitical ambitions in the region. Russian Foreign Minister
  Sergey Lavrov told RT on Wednesday that “the Americans are
  running the show” and he denied claims of a Russian military
  presence in Ukraine.



  In addition, he said that the Russian troops massed along the
  Ukrainian border had been deployed for routine drills, something
  that has been verified by international inspectors.


“Ukraine is just one manifestation of the American
  unwillingness to yield in the geopolitical fight. Americans are
  not ready to admit that they cannot run the show in each and
  every part of the globe from Washington alone,” Lavrov said.



  In Ukraine, the coup-appointed government in Kiev re-launched an
  “anti-terror operation” in the east of the country after
  pledging to cease all violence at four-sided talks between the
  EU, the US, Russia and Ukraine in Geneva last week.



  Government tanks besieged the eastern city of Slavyansk on
  Thursday, killing five people as part of a self-proclaimed
  “anti-terror operation.” Pro-Russian activists have
  taken control of government buildings in the area to protest the
  coup-appointed government in Kiev, which they view as

Kiev has no legal grounds for halting water supply to Crimea, its First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev told ITAR-TASS on Saturday, April 26.

“The Kiev junta has once again shown its real face,” he said.

“There is no and will be no shortage of drinking water in Crimea. But there will certainly be losses in agriculture. We can’t say that the agricultural season has been wrecked, but there will certainly be losses,” Temirgaliyev said.

He said work was underway to draft a drip irrigation programme to save water. “We hope it will be implemented by the next agricultural year,” he added.

Restrictions on the supply of water to Crimea are an act of sabotage on the part of Ukraine, Crimean Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov told the CrimeaInform news agency.

“Ukraine’s act of sabotage to limit the supply of water to the republic through the North Crimean Canal is nothing but a deliberate action against Crimeans,” he said.

Aksyonov said “negotiations are underway with Ukraine at the federal level” to resolve the issue. “There are backup plans. In any case, Crimea will not be left without water. As for drinking water, there are no problems with it,” he said.

The prime minister said that the Crimean authorities were engaged in negotiations with all agricultural producers who have been cut off from water supply from the North Crimean Canal. “The rice situation … is the worst. Crimea is redrawing the map of crop areas in regions where irrigation may not be available,” he said, adding that alternative areas were being offered to agricultural producers.

“The federal budget is ready to compensate agricultural producers for possible losses,” Aksyonov said. He recalled that this issue had been discussed with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak. “Special conditions have been created for Crimea. No one will be left without help,” the prime minister said.

“We are also considering an alternative plan for drilling wells and we are working on this day and night,” he added.

Aksyonov stressed that “the persons who have seized power in Ukraine, including former residents of Crimea, Senchenko and Kunitsyn, are acting like enemies trying to cause their former fellow citizens harm. But they will get a proper assessment from the people of Crimea and will always be persona non-grata in the republic. Usually, those who mischief hatch, mischief catch,” he said.

The State Duma lower house of Russia’s parliament in autumn will return to the consideration of amendments to legislation that are aimed at cost saving for retailers, RF First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview to the Rossiya 24 news television channel.

“We promised to the retail store networks that we will help them, for example, to write off the networks’ costs related to theft.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu gave reassurances to his US counterpart Chuck Hagel that Russia had no plans of bringing its troops to Ukraine, a spokesman for Pentagon said.

Shoigu and Secretary of Defense Hagel held a telephone conversation on Monday discussing the tense situation in Ukraine.

Following the conversation Pentagon Press Secretary Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement that Shoigu reiterated his assurance that Russian forces would not invade [Ukraine].

Kirby also said in the statement that Hagel repeated his call for an end to Russia's destabilizing influence inside Ukraine and warned that continued aggression would further isolate Russia and result in more diplomatic and economic pressure.

On Monday the United States introduced a third set of sanctions against Russia. The new US measures envisioned sanctions against seven Russian officials as well as 17 country’s companies. Canada and the European Union also announced new sanctions against Russia on Monday.

Following the talks between Shoigu and Hagel, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the military officials “had a frank one-hour conversation and exchanged concerns about tensions in Ukraine.”

Some western media allegations about Moscow’s intentions to invade Ukraine emerged after Russia launched military drills last week in the country’s regions bordering on Ukraine.

Shoigu told Hagel that under the pretext of “fighting terrorism” the Kiev regime had amassed about 80 tanks, over 130 armored personnel carriers and fighting vehicles, at least 60 artillery systems and mortars in the southeast of Ukraine. Combat aircraft and helicopters are engaged on a regular basis. The overall number of Ukrainian troops has reached 15,000 personnel, and “all this against the peaceful population of their own country”, the minister said.

“The possibility of forceful actions against peaceful people prompted Russia to launch large-scale maneuvers on the national territory in regions bordering on Ukraine. This decision was made public,” he said. “However, as soon as the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had no intention to use regular military units against unarmed people, the Russian units were ordered back to their bases.”

Shoigu also flatly denied “unfounded assertions” about the presence of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in Ukraine where they are allegedly destabilizing the situation in southeastern regions of the country.

The situation in Ukraine is far from stable after a coup in February, which brought to power new people amid deadly riots as President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave the country citing security concerns.

After Crimea's accession to Russia, which Kiev and Western countries do not accept despite Russia’s repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law, protests against the new Kiev leaders erupted in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeastern regions. Demonstrators, who are demanding referendums on the country’s federalization, took control of some government buildings.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu gave reassurances to his US counterpart Chuck Hagel that Russia had no plans of bringing its troops to Ukraine, a spokesman for Pentagon said.

Shoigu and Secretary of Defense Hagel held a telephone conversation on Monday discussing the tense situation in Ukraine.

Following the conversation Pentagon Press Secretary Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement that Shoigu reiterated his assurance that Russian forces would not invade [Ukraine].

Kirby also said in the statement that Hagel repeated his call for an end to Russia's destabilizing influence inside Ukraine and warned that continued aggression would further isolate Russia and result in more diplomatic and economic pressure.

On Monday the United States introduced a third set of sanctions against Russia. The new US measures envisioned sanctions against seven Russian officials as well as 17 country’s companies. Canada and the European Union also announced new sanctions against Russia on Monday.

Following the talks between Shoigu and Hagel, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the military officials “had a frank one-hour conversation and exchanged concerns about tensions in Ukraine.”

Some western media allegations about Moscow’s intentions to invade Ukraine emerged after Russia launched military drills last week in the country’s regions bordering on Ukraine.

Shoigu told Hagel that under the pretext of “fighting terrorism” the Kiev regime had amassed about 80 tanks, over 130 armored personnel carriers and fighting vehicles, at least 60 artillery systems and mortars in the southeast of Ukraine. Combat aircraft and helicopters are engaged on a regular basis. The overall number of Ukrainian troops has reached 15,000 personnel, and “all this against the peaceful population of their own country”, the minister said.

“The possibility of forceful actions against peaceful people prompted Russia to launch large-scale maneuvers on the national territory in regions bordering on Ukraine. This decision was made public,” he said. “However, as soon as the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had no intention to use regular military units against unarmed people, the Russian units were ordered back to their bases.”

The agreement, which will have an initial 10-year term, was touted as the highlight of Obama's first visit to the Philippines, the United States' oldest ally in the region.

It sets the framework for a beefed-up rotation of U.S. troops, ships and warplanes through the Philippines, part of a rebalancing of U.S. resources towards fast-growing Asia and the Pacific.

But China interprets the move as an attempt to contain its increasing military capability and embolden Manila in a decades-long territorial dispute with Beijing.

The goal for this agreement is to build Philippine capacity to engage in training, engage in coordination, not simply to deal with issues of maritime security, but also to enhance our capabilities so that if there is a natural disaster that takes place we can respond quickly, Obama told a joint news conference in Manila after talks with President Benigno Aquino.

Our goal is not to counter China, our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make sure that international rules and norms are respected, and that includes the area of maritime disputes.

He reiterated Washington's support for Manila's move to seek international arbitration over conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea, an important shipping route that is believed to be rich in energy resources.

REGIONAL TENSIONS

The Philippines is the last stop on a week-long tour of Asia partly aimed at reassuring U.S. allies that Washington remains committed to its strategic pivot to the region.

Obama said all four countries he has visited, including Japan, which has its own dispute with China over tiny islands in the East China Sea, were committed to seeking a peaceful resolution of territorial issues.

China claims about 90 percent of the South China Sea, a claim that overlaps with those of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.

China has rejected international arbitration, preferring a bilateral route to solving the jurisdictional disputes.

Rising regional tensions were highlighted by a commentary from China's state news agency Xinhua criticizing the pact.

Given that the Philippines is at a bitter territorial row with China, the move is particularly disturbing as it may embolden Manila in dealing with Beijing, the commentary said.

A more assertive or even reckless Manila would stoke regional tensions and in turn upset Obama's policy of rebalancing.

Aquino said China shouldn't be concerned about the new agreement, which is aimed at increasing joint military training, especially for disaster relief operations.

The United States and the Philippines will hold joint exercises next week in areas mostly north of the capital.

We are not a threat militarily to any country, we don't even have ... presently a single fighter aircraft in our inventory, Aquino said, adding his country had legitimate needs to protect its 36,000 km (22,370 miles) coastline.

NO NEW BASES

The United States was not seeking to rebuild old military bases or construct new ones under the agreement, said Obama, who was greeted with a 21-gun salute upon his arrival at the presidential palace in the former U.S. colony.

Dozens of anti-U.S. protesters shouted slogans and waved banners to protest against his visit outside the palace.

The United States had maintained two military bases northwest of Manila, including Subic Bay, which was once its biggest overseas naval base, until the Philippine Senate ordered U.S. troops to leave in 1991.

Eight years later, the Senate approved an agreement providing for temporary visits by U.S. forces, allowing the staging of joint military exercises.

Officials said the new security accord did not specify the number of U.S. troops and equipment to be deployed in the country, with those details to be discussed separately by the two governments.

They can do construction and upgrade of infrastructure, they can store or preposition defense equipment, supplies and material, as well as hard equipment and supplies, said Lourdes Yparraguirre, Philippine ambassador to Austria and a member of the negotiating panel that worked on the deal for eight months.

China was never discussed in the negotiations, she told reporters on the sidelines of a signing ceremony hours before Obama's arrival.

We don't aim to contain or confront anyone. I hope that our neighbors in the region would also view this agreement as a positive contribution to peace, stability, security and prosperity in the region.

The third round of US sanctions do not heavily target Russia's key industries, but include asset freezes against 17 companies and 7 individuals, including Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin.


  All companies on the fresh round of sanctions are owned by Gennady
  Timchenko, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, or Bank Rossiya, which were targets of the
  second round, the US Treasury Department said in a statement on their website on Monday, April
  28.


Companies have been designated on the Entity List based on a
  determination they are involved, or pose a significant risk of
  becoming involved, in activities contrary to the national
  security and foreign policy interests of the United States,
  the US Office of Congressional and Public Affairs said in a press
  release.



  The banks sanctioned are SMP Bank, Russia's 36th largest by
  assets, Sobinbank, the country's 90th largest bank, and
  Investkapitalbank, number 197.



  Arkady Rotenberg's bank, SMP, was ready for the
  sanctions, according to a bank spokesperson, who said the lending
  institution had already taken a number of precautions to minimize
  any sanction-related damage to customers.



  Following the announcement of sanctions, US-based payment system
  MasterCard suspended its services to two Russian banks, targeted
  SMP and Investcapitalbank. This brings the number of Russian
  banks that the system has stopped working with to four. In March,
  MasterCard suspended work with Sobinbank and Bank Rossiya, but
  then resumed services shortly. International
  payment systems Visa and MasterCard already halted services with
  both SMP and Investcapitalbank in March.



  No publicly-listed Russian companies were included on the new
  sanction list, but Obama said that the US and its allies would
  keep broader sanctions “in reserve” in the event of
  further escalation on the ground in Ukraine. Before, US
  politicians called for sanctions against Russia's finance and
  energy sectors.



  Sechin, Sanctioned



  Igor Sechin, the head of Russia’s biggest oil company Rosneft, is
  a prominent Russian businessman singled out by the US. Former
  Board of Director, Sergey Chemezov, was also placed under
  sanctioned. Chemezov is the current CEO of state-owned hi-tech
  holding company Rostec.



  Sanctions, however, do not affect Russia’s state-owned Rosneft.



  Commenting on the newly imposed sanctions, Sechin linked the
  measure to Rosneft’s activity and considered it as “an
  appreciation” of the company’s “efficiency”.

“We understand that the American administration noticed the
  company’s active actions aimed at minimizing the risks, linked
  with the unilateral orientation of hydrocarbons exports to
  concrete regional markets, Rosneft's press office cited
  Sechin as saying in a statement. I take the last steps by
  Washington as an appreciation of the efficiency of our
  work.


  He assured Rosneft’s shareholders that the US measures against
  him would not affect the company’s effectiveness and stressed
  that the oil producer will continue cooperation with American
  partners.



  Despite the sanctions, US oil giant ExxonMobil and Rosneft will

  spokesperson said
  the move was stupid and would sabotage the
  West, which has very tight-knit relations with 'Big Oil'
  companies based in the UK and US.



  Rosneft is the world’s largest-listed oil company, and British
  Petroleum (BP) has a 19.75 percent stake, making it the biggest

We are considering today's announcement to see specifically
  what this may mean for BP, a spokesman for BP in London
  said, adding the company would comply with any
  relevant sanctions.


We are committed to our investment in Rosneft, and we intend
  to remain a successful, long term investor in Russia, the
  spokesman said.



  Other individuals on the list are politicians, including Deputy
  Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak and Aleksey Pushkov, Chairman of the
  State Duma Committee on International Affairs.



  Individuals on the new list will have their assets frozen and be
  denied visas to travel to the US.



  America's 'Cold War Mentality'



  Previously, the EU and
  US
  blacklisted dozens of Russian politicians and businessmen,
  freezing assets and issuing travel bans. The US also imposed
  sanctions on Russia’s 14th largest lender, Bank Rossiya.



  The US Treasury Department's statement said the new sanctions
  were motivated by Russia's failure to deescalate violence in
  neighboring Ukraine.



  Moscow maintains that further economic sanctions against Russia
  simply fuel the revival of a Cold War mentality and are
  counter-productive. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said
  that Western efforts to disrupt Russia's influence over the world
  energy market will backfire and hurt the US.



  The EU has so far not introduced a third stage of sanctions
  against Russia over Ukraine, as there is little consensus among
  member states.



  On April 17, leaders from Russia, Ukraine, EU, and the US
  agreed a peace plan for Ukraine in Geneva,
  Switzerland.","US sanctions won't undermine Russian economy

The third round of US sanctions do not heavily target Russia's key industries, but include asset freezes against 17 companies and 7 individuals, including Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin.


  All companies on the fresh round of sanctions are owned by Gennady
  Timchenko, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, or Bank Rossiya, which were targets of the
  second round, the US Treasury Department said in a statement on their website on Monday, April
  28.


Companies have been designated on the Entity List based on a
  determination they are involved, or pose a significant risk of
  becoming involved, in activities contrary to the national
  security and foreign policy interests of the United States,
  the US Office of Congressional and Public Affairs said in a press
  release.



  The banks sanctioned are SMP Bank, Russia's 36th largest by
  assets, Sobinbank, the country's 90th largest bank, and
  Investkapitalbank, number 197.



  Arkady Rotenberg's bank, SMP, was ready for the
  sanctions, according to a bank spokesperson, who said the lending
  institution had already taken a number of precautions to minimize
  any sanction-related damage to customers.



  Following the announcement of sanctions, US-based payment system
  MasterCard suspended its services to two Russian banks, targeted
  SMP and Investcapitalbank. This brings the number of Russian
  banks that the system has stopped working with to four. In March,
  MasterCard suspended work with Sobinbank and Bank Rossiya, but
  then resumed services shortly. International
  payment systems Visa and MasterCard already halted services with
  both SMP and Investcapitalbank in March.



  No publicly-listed Russian companies were included on the new
  sanction list, but Obama said that the US and its allies would
  keep broader sanctions “in reserve” in the event of
  further escalation on the ground in Ukraine. Before, US
  politicians called for sanctions against Russia's finance and
  energy sectors.



  Sechin, Sanctioned



  Igor Sechin, the head of Russia’s biggest oil company Rosneft, is
  a prominent Russian businessman singled out by the US. Former
  Board of Director, Sergey Chemezov, was also placed under
  sanctioned. Chemezov is the current CEO of state-owned hi-tech
  holding company Rostec.



  Sanctions, however, do not affect Russia’s state-owned Rosneft.



  Commenting on the newly imposed sanctions, Sechin linked the
  measure to Rosneft’s activity and considered it as “an
  appreciation” of the company’s “efficiency”.

“We understand that the American administration noticed the
  company’s active actions aimed at minimizing the risks, linked
  with the unilateral orientation of hydrocarbons exports to
  concrete regional markets, Rosneft's press office cited
  Sechin as saying in a statement. I take the last steps by
  Washington as an appreciation of the efficiency of our
  work.


  He assured Rosneft’s shareholders that the US measures against
  him would not affect the company’s effectiveness and stressed
  that the oil producer will continue cooperation with American
  partners.



  Despite the sanctions, US oil giant ExxonMobil and Rosneft will
  continue to develop hydrocarbon reserves in the arctic waters of
  Russia. On Monday, Rosneft approved the development of two oil
  fields jointly with ExxonMobil at a board meeting, the company
  said in a statement.



  Rosneft shares in Moscow fell 1.56 percent at 18:30 local Moscow

The new round of sanctions against Russia, which the EU and the US plan to unveil Monday, will not target the Russian economy. Washington said it won’t use economic sanctions without the EU also signing up to them.


  G7 members agreed Friday to roll out a third round of
  anti-Russian sanctions over the Ukrainian crisis. But those would
  be an extension of the previous two rounds of sanctions, which
  targeted 33 individuals in Russia and Ukraine and a Russian bank,
  which the Western government deemed responsible for the crisis in
  Ukraine or close enough to President Vladimir Putin to have
  leverage on him.


What we will hear about in the coming days, what we will
  agree ... is an expansion of existing sanctions, measures against
  individuals or entities in Russia, UK Foreign Secretary
  William Hague told Sky News on Sunday.



  The new round will slap travel bans and asset freezes on 15 more
  people, according to numerous insider reports. But it’s unlikely
  that they would have any greater effect on Russian policies than
  the sanctions already in effect. If anything, so far sanctions
  against the officials have only resulted in mocking calls from
  Russian MPs, politicians and ordinary citizens to add their names
  on the blacklists.



  Imposing sanctions on some sectors of the Russian economy, which
  could actually hurt the country, remains an elusive goal for
  Washington. At the same time America, whose economic ties with
  Russia are mediocre at best compared to Europe’s, is unwilling to
  act alone. Otherwise, it would appear that there is conflict
  between Russia and the US, not Russia and the world, a narrative
  that Washington is struggling to promote.


We're going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin
  when he sees that the world is unified and the United States and
  Europe is unified rather than this is just a US-Russian
  conflict, US President Barack Obama told reporters on
  Sunday.



  But Europe has much to lose from imposing economic sanctions on
  Russia, and Obama said he sees how US-only sanctions won’t work.


“If we, for example, say that we are not going to allow
  certain arms sales to Russia, but every European defense
  contractor backfills what we do, then it’s not very
  effective,” he said.



  With Russia being a major supplier of raw materials and buyer of
  European goods, the EU governments are far from being eager to
  shoot themselves in the foot with economic sanctions.


“At the moment there is no consensus among the EU members on
  which economic measures against Russia would be acceptable, or
  even if they are needed at all,” a European diplomatic
  source told Itar-Tass.



  The diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said only
  an open military invasion of Ukraine or irrefutable proof of
  Russian clandestine military presence in Ukraine would tip EU’s
  stance toward economic sanctions. So far every piece of evidence
  that Kiev and Washington made public of alleged involvement of
  Russian agents in Ukraine was either inconclusive or simply
  false.



  The US and the EU are accusing Russia of stirring up
  anti-government protest in eastern Ukraine and failing to fulfill
  its obligations under last week’s Geneva statement. They want
  Moscow to publicly denounce the protesters holding governmental
  buildings in Ukraine in defiance of a military crackdown launched
  by Kiev.



  Russia insists that it is the post-coup Ukrainian government,
  which is not making necessary steps to deescalate the violence.

Kim led a meeting of the Central Military Commission and set forth important tasks for further developing the Korean People's Army and ways to do so, KCNA news agency said.

He stressed the need to enhance the function and role of the political organs of the army if it is to preserve the proud history and tradition of being the army of the party, win one victory after another in the confrontation with the U.S. and creditably perform the mission as a shock force and standard-bearer in building a thriving nation.

Obama said on Saturday on a visit to Seoul, where the U.S. army has a large presence, that the United States did not use its military might to impose things on others, but that it would use that might if necessary to defend South Korea from any attack by the reclusive North.

North and South Korea are still technically at war after their 1950-53 civil conflict ended in a mere truce.

The impoverished North, which routinely threatens the United States and the South with destruction, warned last month it would not rule out a new form of atomic test after the U.N. Security Council condemned Pyongyang's launch of a mid-range ballistic missile into the sea east of the Korean peninsula.

North Korea is already subject to U.N. sanctions over its previous three atomic tests.

Recent satellite data shows continued work at the nuclear test site in North Korea, although experts analyzing the data say that preparations do not appear to have progressed far enough for an imminent test.

We don't use our military might to impose these things on others, but we will not hesitate to use our military might to defend our allies and our way of life, Obama told U.S. forces at the Yongsan garrison.

So like all nations on Earth, North Korea and its people have a choice. They can choose to continue down a lonely road of isolation, or they can choose to join the rest of the world and seek a future of greater opportunity, and greater security, and greater respect - a future that already exists for the citizens on the southern end of the Korean peninsula.

The impoverished North, which routinely threatens the United States and the South with destruction, warned last month it would not rule out a new form of atomic test after the U.N. Security Council condemned Pyongyang's launch of a mid-range ballistic missile into the sea east of the Korean peninsula.

North Korea is already subject to U.N. sanctions over its previous three atomic tests.

Recent satellite data shows continued work at the nuclear test site in North Korea, although experts analyzing the data say that preparations do not appear to have progressed far enough for an imminent test.

We don't use our military might to impose these things on others, but we will not hesitate to use our military might to defend our allies and our way of life, Obama told U.S. forces at the Yongsan garrison.

So like all nations on Earth, North Korea and its people have a choice. They can choose to continue down a lonely road of isolation, or they can choose to join the rest of the world and seek a future of greater opportunity, and greater security, and greater respect - a future that already exists for the citizens on the southern end of the Korean peninsula.

U.S. is about to introduce new sanctions “to punish Russia” and in particular to target a range of individuals and corporations, as well as the Russian defense industry, U.S. deputy national security advisor Tony Blinken said Sunday on a CBS program.

Russia’s punishment is pursuant to its alleged failure to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine’s breadwinning eastern regions where the protesters from among the mostly Russian-speaking population, whom Washington invariably labels as “pro-Russian separatists”, are demanding a referendum on the future status of the area and the transformation of the country into a federation.

We're going to save a little news for Monday but what I can tell you is this, Blinken said.

We will be looking to designate people who are in his (Russian President Vladimir Putin’s - Itar-Tass) inner circle, who have a significant impact on the Russian economy,” he said. We'll be looking to designate companies that they and other inner circle people control.”

“We'll be looking at taking steps, as well, with regard to high-technology exports to their (Russian) defense industry,” Blinken indicated. “All of this together is going to have an impact.”

Blinken claimed that the sanction introduced by Washington and Brussels after the mid-March referendum in Crimea on reunification with Russia had had a tarnishing effect on the Russian economy.

We've already seen a significant impact of the pressure we've exerted on Russia over the last several weeks,” he said adding specifically that the Russian financial markets were down 22% since the beginning of the year and “the ruble is at the lowest level ever.

Vladimir Putin said during a major annual question-time televised show April 17 that the West might be seeking to turn him into a major object of sanctions. “Quite possibly, they’re making an attempt of this kind.

When he was asked about Western sanctions against businessmen Gennady Timchenko, Arkady Rotenberg and Boris Rotenberg, he said: “They are good acquaintances of mine, actually friends, and they earned their capitals before we got to know each other.”

“For instance, Mr. Timchenko has been engaged in business since the beginning of the 1990’s,” Putin said. “Speaking seriously, they just don’t have anything to do with the events in Crimea”.

He said they had learned about the Crimean events from TV reports, like most people in Russia. “But they listened to the reports from there literally with tears welling in their eyes and if that’s the reason for punishing them, then they really have something to be punished for.”

Putin added in this connection that he had no shame for his friends’ conduct.","WASHINGTON, April 27. /ITAR-TASS/.

NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow now says that the allied group has been compelled to treat Russia “as more of an enemy than a partner,” according to an Associated Press report published Thursday.


  The 61-year-old former United States ambassador to Russia
  reportedly told journalists this week that Moscow’s role in the
  ongoing crisis in Ukraine has forced NATO to reconsider the
  alliance’s opinion on Russia, and that additional troops may soon
  be mobilized to the region as tensions worsen.



  AP journalist Robert Burns wrote on Thursday that Vershbow said the
  Kremlin’s perceived part in the recent events in Ukraine
  “marks a turning point in decades of effort by NATO to draw
  Moscow closer.”



  NATO’s second-in-command reportedly told journalists that the
  alliance is now considering new measures meant to counter any
  future acts of aggression on the part of Russia aimed at partner
  nations, and soon could deploy a larger number of combat forces
  to Eastern Europe.



  Journalists reporting for Civil.Ge wrote on Thursday that Vershbow told the
  audience at a panel discussion in Washington, DC one day earlier
  that NATO should deploy “defensive assets to the
  region.”


“We need to step up our support for defense reforms and
  military modernization of Russia’s neighbors, and not just of
  Ukraine, but also Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,”
  Vershbow said, according to the Civil Georgia site.



  NATO should think about “upgrading” joint exercises
  among partner nations, the site quoted Vershbow as saying during
  the event, while acknowledging that deploying forces to Georgia
  would be a “controversial” maneuver.


“It is also important for the United States to show
  leadership… to make sure that next steps that NATO will make, for
  example at the summit in September, will be adequate response to
  what’s happening in Ukraine,” the Georgian Defense Minister
  Irakli Alasania said during the discussion.


“The West should now seize the opportunity and create the
  reality on the ground by accepting membership of aspirant
  countries, by putting purely defensive assets in aspirant
  countries and predominantly in Georgia,” Alasania added.
  “What is important now is to put some deterrent capabilities
  on the ground like air defense and anti-armor capabilities that
  will give us a chance to defend our freedom, because we know that
  if things go wrong at this point no one is coming to save us;
  we’ve seen that in 2008.”


  Earlier this week, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said
  the builduip of NATO troops near Russia’s border was “unprecedented.” Weeks earlier, the US Air
  Force commander in charge of NATO’s military presence in Europe
  said that US troops may soon be deployed to the region as tensions continue to
  worsen near the border between Ukraine and Russia.



  For weeks now, officials in Washington and Kiev have claimed that
  the recent separation of Crimea from Ukraine and the rash of
  uprisings in the country’s eastern part are the direct result of
  destabilization efforts spearheaded by Moscow, and both the US
  and European Union have introduced several rounds of sanctions
  against Russia as a result. The Kremlin has refuted these claims
  and rebuffed the sanctions, however, and earlier this week
  Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin accused the White House of orchestrating the
  Ukrainian crisis.


“I think what is happening now shows us who really was
  mastering the process from the beginning. But in the beginning,
  the United States preferred to remain in the shadow,” Putin

Earlier, the official journal of the European Union has published the names of 10 Russian officials and five representatives of Ukraine’s south-east resistance, against whom have been applied sanctions constituting in ban of entry in EU territory and assets freezing (if any) in member states.

On March 17, the European Union published the initial sanctions list for Russia and Crimea that included 21 names. Then the European “black list” included eight representatives of the Crimean leadership.",163

Hagel met with Estonian Defense Minister Sven Mikser at the Pentagon on Tuesday morning, and he will meet with Czech Defense Minister Martin Stropnicky later in the day, U.S. Defense Department's Press Secretary John Kirby said.

The Estonian leader thanked the secretary for the United States response for events in Ukraine, including sending soldiers to Estonia for bilateral training and exercises, Kirby said at a news conference.

Hagel told Mikser that the United States will look for other ways to maintain a U.S. presence in the region, Kirby said, adding that the two men spoke about two upcoming exercises, which will involve the participation of a dozen NATO nations.

What we're looking at trying to do is ways in which we can make these preset exercises more robust, using additional assets that are already in Europe, perhaps more aircraft, maybe more ships, Kirby said.

No decisions have been made yet, but the secretary expressed to the Estonian minister this morning that he's interested in ways we can make those two exercises more robust than they already are. And they're already pretty good-sized NATO exercises, he said.

The United States has sent jets to Poland, and to the Baltic Air Policing effort. It has also sent company sized units to Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to exercise with those nations as response to tensions in Ukraine.

Moscow has accused the United States and NATO of staging unprecedented military activity near its borders. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, in a phone call with Hagel, said the Western military activity had been growing substantially, and was accompanied by provocative statements.

Kirby shed more light on Hagel's Monday phone call with Shoigu.

The spokesman described the 45-minute conversation as substantive, noting that the Russian defense chief said twice Russian forces would not cross the border into Ukraine.

To date, there has been no indication that large numbers of Russian troops have stepped away from the border, as indicated by Shoigu, Kirby said.

Tensions are continuing unabated in eastern Ukraine, where pro- Russia militants are engaged in conflicts with government troops and detained eight military observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Slovyansk, Ukraine, Friday before freeing one of them Sunday. Mayor Gennady Kernes of Kharkiv, also in Ukraine, was shot and seriously wounded Monday.

The White House on Monday announced fresh sanctions against Russia, targeting seven government officials and 17 companies linked to the inner circle of President Vladimir Putin.

The European Union is also expected to move against Russia as the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations and the bloc issued a joint statement Friday saying they had agreed to  move swiftly to impose more sanctions on Russia in response to its inaction in helping to ease growing tension in eastern Ukraine.","WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has stepped up consultations with Eastern European allies on the Ukraine situation amid Russia's activities along its border, a Pentagon spokesman said on Tuesday.

Former Prime Minister and Batkivshchina (Fatherland) party leader Yulia Timoshenko said Ukraine “must be a member of NATO” even though a large part of people has many times spoken against this.

In an interview with The Associated Press, excerpts from which were published on Saturday, April 26, Timoshenko, who is running for presidency in Ukraine, spoke of a “fundamental change” in public thinking following the latest events in the east of the country and Russia’s actions.

She believes that the mentality of Ukrainians has changed as has the strategic course of the country. “NATO is the best choice for Ukraine,” she said.

The Associated Press said Timoshenko had previously not supported the idea of Ukraine’s membership in NATO.

Timoshenko is confident that no Third World War will start over the events in Ukraine and believes that “the world will not allow World War III”.

She also welcomed a new round of sanctions on Russia.

Also Timoshenko has urged her competitor Pyotr Poroshenko to revoke his proposal for talks with Russia.

“I want to stress once again that Pyotr Poroshenko’s proposal to the Russian Federation that Russia should determine the place and time of the talks is unacceptable. The negotiation process being conducted in the EU-US-Ukraine-Russia format may not be broken,” Timoshenko said in a statement published on her party’s official website on Saturday, April 26.

“If any of the politicians breaks the negotiation process now and breaks the tough sanctions imposed upon Russia, this will practically legalise the occupation of Crimea and acceptance of Russia’s ultimatums,” she said, adding, “This will basically mean capitulation.”

Timoshenko urged Poroshenko “not to break the negotiation process” and “to withdraw the proposal for a transition to such unclear bilateral negotiations”.

On Friday, April 25, Poroshenko, speaking at the “Ukraine-Russia: Dialogue” congress, asked Moscow “to name the place and time” for talks, while accusing Russia of being unwilling to implement the Geneva accord of April 17 which calls for de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine.

Tycoon Pyotr Poroshenko is enjoying the biggest support among the constituencies, according to public opinion polls published this week. They indicate that 32.9% of respondents are ready to vote for him in the upcoming presidential elections slated for May 25. Timoshenko is second and trailing far behind with 9.5%, followed by MP Sergei Tigipko.

In early April, Poroshenko, replying to a question whether Kiev wanted to join NATO urgently, said, “No, this does not depend on us; this depends on the organisation itself. We can feel that there is no consensus among its member countries on this issue. As president I would like to conduct negotiations with our neighbours about new alliances or additional security possibilities,” he said.","NEW YORK, April 26, /ITAR-TASS/.

The Friday deaths of at least 31 anti-government activists in a fire started by ultra-nationalists in Odessa is the kind of inter-ethnic violence that Russia has warned about for months, Mark Sleboda, a senior lecturer of international affairs, told RT.


  The Moscow State University instructor spoke to RT about the
  violent scene in Odessa, where anti-government protesters were
  forced into the Trade Unions House by Right Sector militias who
  were bussed in from western Ukraine. The ultra-nationalists then
  set fire to the building, leading to a horrific death for dozens.


Of those that survived – either by escaping the building or
  jumping out of the windows – some of them were then made to crawl
  on their hands and knees, despite suffering from burns, through a
  gauntlet, a corridor of shame by these ultra-nationalists, who
  were then beating them, Sleboda said, adding that there is
  video footage of the beatings.



  Sleboda also said the violence was foreseeable, most of all by
  Russia, as soon as the conflict began in February.


RT:The events we're seeing here are a
  serious escalation, aren't they?

Mark Sleboda: Yes, this is the greatest number
  of fatalities that we have seen in this crisis since the riots on
  February 20-21.


RT:Briefly take us through what happened
  today and the offense that led up to all these deaths.

MS: There has been a condition of dueling
  political militias in Odessa for several months now but there
  hadn't been any fatalities as of yet. We know that several
  hundred ultra-nationalists were bussed into Odessa. We have this
  from the local police chief and from the Right Sector themselves.
  They attacked an anti-putsch protest camp in the center of the
  city.



  The self-defense forces of the protest camps certainly fought
  back. They were using makeshift weapons, chains, bats, reportedly
  some small-arms fire, Molotov cocktails, and stones. We know that
  regular people on both sides were participating. We saw
  pensioners throwing pavement stones and hitting people with
  clubs, which is an absolute Balkan, former Yugoslavia level of
  neighbor-on-neighbor violence.



  At one point, when a firetruck came on the scene, the pro-putsch
  mob took control of the fire brigade truck, beat the driver, and
  then tried to use the truck to ram the self-defense lines of the
  anti-putsch protesters and crush them. Then the anti-putsch
  protesters eventually retreated from the onslaught inside the
  Trade Unions building. The pro-putsch protesters, the
  ultra-nationalists, they set the building on fire. At least
  30-some people died from smoke inhalation or burning. Others
  jumped out of the windows. Eight people died jumping out of the
  windows.



  Of those that survived – either by escaping the building or
  jumping out of the windows – some of them were then made to crawl
  on their hands and knees, despite suffering from burns, through a
  gauntlet, a corridor of shame by these ultra-nationalists, who
  were then beating them. We have video of this.


RT:We have an eyewitness account, someone
  who was at the building when it was attacked. We'll listen to
  what he says.

Witness Valery Kaurov, self-proclaimed head of the
  Republic of Odessa: One policeman died after being
  injured by Right Sector radicals who came today to Odessa. There
  were over a thousand of them. They wanted to hold a rally here
  for United Ukraine and march toward our tent camp. We knew
  beforehand of this provocation, so some of our brigades met them
  as they were making their way to us. That's when these radicals
  began throwing Molotov cocktails, rocks, and started to fight
  with our guys, but our teams were able to fend them off and stop
  them. Seeing all their attempts were fruitless; they opened
  gunfire. That's how one of our guys and a policeman were killed.
  These radicals were trying to get to our Orthodox outpost, where
  many people come to pray for the Berkut soldiers who lost their
  lives on Maidan. We're ready to fight to the end.


RT:Russian officials have warned that
  Ukraine is on the brink of civil war. Is this what you see?

MS: Yes, Russia has been warning about this, not
  just for the last few weeks, but for months now, when there was
  an attempt to try to force Ukraine to make a political decision
  on east-west with, first, the association agreement. Then when
  the regime took power through the mob protests on February 21-22.
  Russia has been warning that level of inter-ethnic violence was
  inevitable, and this is the result we've seen.


RT:How much control does the Kiev
  government have over the Right Sector, if any at all?

MS: Various times in the crisis, they have shown
  that they have no control over the Right Sector. There was a
  truce that was broken around February 19 or 20 by the Right
  Sector. The February 21 agreement was broken by February 22 by
  the Right Sector. And we have seen repeated riots in Kiev as
  other Right Sector and ultra-nationalists marched on the Rada,
  trying to force further and further right policies on this
  regime.


RT:Do you expect to see further violence in
  eastern and southern Ukraine?

MS: We've already gotten reports of further
  encroachments in Kramatorsk and Slavyansk, and Dmitry Yarosh, the
  leader of the Right Sector, has just announced that he will
  personally go to Slavyansk to oversee the final stages of the
  operation, as he put it.

Far from conflict hot spots in the Middle East and now Eastern Europe, the Asia-Pacific is home to some of the world's most dynamic, exciting economies. As Obama's former national security adviser Tom Donilon wrote this week in The Washington Post, the administration is keen to move beyond the wars and occupations that dominated U.S. national security policy and resources for the past decade in favor of a shift toward the region that presents the most significant opportunity for the United States.

But Asia is hardly a space free of contest. Obama's swing through Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines — four democracies with warm ties to the U.S. — is a visit to allies who are, to varying degrees, wary of the rise of budding superpower China. Though U.S. officials repeatedly disavow claims that the U.S. seeks to contain China, Beijing appears to believe it and so do many scholarly observers. Here are three ways the specter of China looms large during Obama's Asia trip.

Balance of power in the Pacific: For decades, a Pax Americana, underpinned by U.S. naval supremacy, has authored the status quo in Asia. American military dominance is still a fact, but China's aggressive military expansion over the past two decades — its defense budget grew more than 12 percent this year alone — calls into question the long-term balance of power. Last year, China commissioned 17 new warships, more than any other nation. It aims to have four aircraft carriers by 2020 and has developed a considerable fleet of nuclear submarines. In the next few decades, China's ability to project naval power will extend deep into the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. (The Obama administration, in a thinly-veiled response, has committed to an expanded military presence in Australia and will work on a new security deal with the Philippines when in Manila next week.)

China's build-up comes alongside an increasing number of diplomatic spats between China and its neighbors over disputed territories, particularly islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Tensions with the nationalist government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the Senkaku islands, known by the Chinese as the Diaoyu Islands, have flared dangerously in the past year, with Japanese and Chinese aircraft and vessels engaging in dangerously provocative maneuvers.

Calming Asia's troubled waters is no easy task, especially for an administration that wants to buttress traditional allies but remains fearful of antagonizing Beijing. Obama's mixed messaging in Tokyo was evidence of the awkward diplomatic tight rope he has to walk.

China’s global footprint: China is changing the game away from Asia as well. This year, China eclipsed the U.S. for the first time as the world’s largest trading nation. The map below, compiled by the Chinese Relations blog, shows the extent to which China has become the biggest trading partner of many countries in the developing world, particularly in Africa. (Note: It discounts the European Union as a single trading bloc for illustrative effect.)

China is the number one trading partner of all countries in red pic.twitter.com/GgX9tun7gU— Amazing Maps (@Amazing_Maps) December 21, 2013

Beyond trade, China is pouring billions of dollars into megaprojects around the world. Its state companies are building and investing in roads, mines, stadiums and dams from Papua New Guinea to Peru. The growing scope of China Inc. — driven largely by China's insatiable appetite for natural resources — raises thorny questions about the future of global politics. Is Chinese influence in developing countries harmful for democracy? How does Washington deal with its declining clout in Latin America? Should we be concerned about a new form of Chinese neo-imperialism? The Obama administration's desire to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, a massive free trade pact that would knit together a host of countries around the Pacific, is in part aimed at reasserting American influence in a part of the world where it was once the unquestioned hegemon.

Friendship with Russia: It's no secret U.S.-Russia relations are in a bad place, with the West struggling to deal with Moscow's power play in Ukraine. Sanctions on Russian officials have been imposed and new rounds threatened as the Ukraine crisis worsens. But China, Russia's frequent collaborator on the U.N. Security Council, presents Russia with something of an escape. Recent reports suggest that the two countries may be close on a long-mooted natural gas deal worth billions of dollars. It's a deal that makes sense, especially if Russia wants to thumb its nose at Europe — currently the chief importer of Russian natural gas.

Russia and China are finding more reasons to deepen their political and economic ties, expanding trade and military links. For American strategists, they present a troubling axis of illiberal, authoritarian states that has already stymied U.S. objectives over a host of issues at the U.N., including the drive for tough action on Syria. At the same time, the U.S.'s democratic allies in Asia are finding more reasons to bicker — Abe's nationalist government in Japan has riled South Korea — while India and the grouping of Southeast Asian nations, ASEAN, show little to no inclination to help the U.S. hedge against China. The American pivot to Asia may be an escape from quagmires further west, but it comes with no shortage of headaches of its own.","President Obama's ongoing tour through four Asian countries is a sign, we're told, of Washington's renewed effort to pivot or rebalance toward Asia.

The map below, compiled by the Chinese Relations blog, shows the extent to which China has become the biggest trading partner of many countries in the developing world, particularly in Africa. (Note: It discounts the European Union as a single trading bloc for illustrative effect.)

Beyond trade, China is pouring billions of dollars into megaprojects around the world. Its state companies are building and investing in roads, mines, stadiums and dams from Papua New Guinea to Peru. The growing scope of China Inc. — driven largely by China's insatiable appetite for natural resources — raises thorny questions about the future of global politics. Is Chinese influence in developing countries harmful for democracy? How does Washington deal with its declining clout in Latin America? Should we be concerned about a new form of Chinese neo-imperialism? The Obama administration's desire to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, a massive free trade pact that would knit together a host of countries around the Pacific, is in part aimed at reasserting American influence in a part of the world where it was once the unquestioned hegemon.

Friendship with Russia: It's no secret U.S.-Russia relations are in a bad place, with the West struggling to deal with Moscow's power play in Ukraine. Sanctions on Russian officials have been imposed and new rounds threatened as the Ukraine crisis worsens. But China, Russia's frequent collaborator on the U.N. Security Council, presents Russia with something of an escape. Recent reports suggest that the two countries may be close on a long-mooted natural gas deal worth billions of dollars. It's a deal that makes sense, especially if Russia wants to thumb its nose at Europe — currently the chief importer of Russian natural gas.

Russia and China are finding more reasons to deepen their political and economic ties, expanding trade and military links. For American strategists, they present a troubling axis of illiberal, authoritarian states that has already stymied U.S. objectives over a host of issues at the U.N., including the drive for tough action on Syria. At the same time, the U.S.'s democratic allies in Asia are finding more reasons to bicker — Abe's nationalist government in Japan has riled South Korea — while India and the grouping of Southeast Asian nations, ASEAN, show little to no inclination to help the U.S. hedge against China. The American pivot to Asia may be an escape from quagmires further west, but it comes with no shortage of headaches of its own.",1031

The demonstrators even burned an effigy of the American commander-in-chief. But that did nothing to thwart the inking of a landmark security deal between the two countries.

The new 10-year defense agreement is perhaps the most significant achievement of Obama's four-country tour of Asia, where the Philippines was the final destination. U.S. troops now have expanded access to Philippine facilities and will participate in an increased number of joint military exercises with the archipelago nation. There's no plan at present for a permanent American troop presence nor a clear indication that the U.S. would come to the Philippines' defense in the face of an external threat. But the pact represents something an about-face for Manila: more than two decades ago, the last U.S. naval base in the country at Subic Bay -- a legacy of nearly half a century of American colonial rule -- was shut down. (At the time, Aquino's mother, Corazon, was the country's President.)

The protesters demonstrating against Obama were angered by what they saw as the meddling return of a former imperial power. But a much larger group of Filipinos is more concerned with newer Asian realities. The Philippines has increasingly sparred with China over disputed islands in the South China Sea, a body of water that China claims almost in its entirety, despite the rival claims of a number of Southeast nations. As detailed here, China's emergence as a budding superpower has occurred parallel to a massive expansion of its naval capabilities, which has other countries in the region nervous. In the last two years, Chinese and Philippine vessels have engaged in tense standoffs over a set of shoals (see map below) just miles away from the Philippine coast.

This March, Chinese coast guard ships blocked Philippine civilian vessels from resupplying marines stationed at the Second Thomas shoal, among the countless spits of rock and reef that comprise the contested archipelagos of the South China Sea. In 2012, after the Philippine navy intercepted Chinese fishing vessels poaching protected species by the Scarborough shoal, Chinese maritime ships arrived to prevent the fishermen's arrest--an incident that almost escalated into conflict.

The spats have inflamed Philippine public opinion. According to Pew, only 48 percent of Filipinos now have a favorable view of China--compared to 85 percent for the U.S. For all the ire American foreign policy attracts elsewhere in the world, there are still countries--including many in East Asia--where the involvement of the U.S. is recognized as a guarantor of stability. The Philippines, in particular, is a nation well-disposed to the U.S., with so much of its politics and society shaped by the decades of American occupation following the Spanish-American War.

Manila's alliance with Washington has strengthened under Aquino. When I met him before his election victory in 2010, he spoke generously of China's role in the region and the Philippines' desire to have strong ties with all major players in the Pacific. But, in the intervening years, Aquino's stance perceptibly hardened and he has become perhaps the most forthright statesman in Southeast Asia when it comes to confronting perceived Chinese aggression.

Obama, meanwhile, reiterated that the new defense deal with the Philippines was not about containing China. But it's hard not to view it in the context of a larger geopolitical chess match in the Pacific. The U.S. now has greater operational flexibility when contemplating maneuvers and actions in the South China Sea. The protesters in Manila may remain apoplectic about Uncle Sam's footprint, but strategists in Beijing will have cause for pause, as well.","On Monday, thousands of protesters greeted President Obama as he held talks with his counterpart Benigno Noynoy Aquino III at the presidential palace in Manila.

Ukraine remains the center of attention of the world’s media and policy-makers. Alongside signs of a diplomatic progress, in particular the agreements reached in Geneva on 17 April, the situation on the ground remains complicated.


  At the Geneva meeting, Russia, the US, the EU and the Kiev
  authorities agreed principles that, if implemented, may lead to
  de-escalation. They include disarming unlawful armed groups,
  vacating illegally seized public buildings and spaces, an amnesty
  for all protesters, and the launch of an inclusive, transparent
  and accountable constitutional process. All parties condemned
  expressions of extremism, racism and religious intolerance,
  including anti-Semitism.



  Unfortunately, these provisions have been interpreted in Kiev and
  in Western capitals as commitments undertaken by Russia with
  regard to the situation in eastern Ukraine. It is hard to
  consider this approach as anything but a deliberate distortion of
  reality.



  First, it is wrong to portray the situation as if the main
  problem is in eastern Ukraine. Yes, people have taken up arms and
  seized public buildings. What our Western colleagues don’t want
  to see is that these actions are a reaction to what happened in
  Kiev – to the violent unconstitutional coup, to attempts to
  curtail the status of the Russian language, to calls by
  extremists for punitive operations in the east, to the inability
  of the authorities to end provocation or begin meaningful
  dialogue with Russian-speaking regions. One cannot expect people
  to go home when no steps are being taken to end the threats from
  Kiev and western Ukraine.



  Second, it is unacceptable that the situation in the east is
  described as being the result of Russian meddling. We haven’t
  seen the slightest proof of that. Kiev and Washington are unable
  to corroborate their claims by anything other than the fact that
  the activists speak Russian and hold Kalashnikovs – which is also
  the case for most Ukrainian servicemen in that area. British
  reporters on the ground overwhelmingly agree the protest movement
  has local roots and is manned by local residents. That Russia can
  order them to stop protesting is pure fantasy.



  In short, by blaming eastern activists and Russia, Kiev and their
  Western backers are trying to divert attention from the lack of
  positive steps on their part. Instead of disarming Right Sector
  extremists, the authorities in Kiev are continuing to threaten
  the east with an “anti-terrorist” operation to be
  performed with the participation of “civil society
  activists.” Those are openly recruited by the neo-Nazi Right
  Sector group in Maidan [Independence Square] in Kiev.



  The protest camp in central Kiev is still in place, and the
  authorities have announced that the Geneva agreement doesn’t
  apply to it since it is “lawful.” No amnesty law has
  been passed; on the contrary, many protesters are still in
  detention, including one of the leaders of the movement in
  Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev, who has gone on a hunger strike in
  protest. The constitutional process remains behind closed doors
  with no eastern participation, in spite of clear public proposals
  made by a number of eastern forces as well as the Party of the
  Regions. In this context, it is amazing to read about Western
  politicians praising the efforts of the Kiev government in
  “implementing” the Geneva accords and calling upon
  Russia to follow suit.



  As with many other international and domestic crises, the key
  thing that Ukraine is lacking is trust. The authorities in Kiev
  badly need to take urgent, clear and meaningful steps that will
  (if not generate confidence) at least limit the current level of
  mistrust that the east feels towards them. Time is running out,
  and not only in terms of growing frustration and determination of
  the eastern movement, but also in the light of the dire economic
  situation in Ukraine. If the current leaders continue to see the
  situation exclusively through the prism of “Russian
  aggression” instead of addressing the real problems, they
  risk plunging their country into an economic abyss. Such a
  scenario is deeply troubling for Russia and the Russian people,
  who wish their Ukrainian brothers and sisters well, but the risks
  are increasing with every day that passes.

"http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/729875?utm_medium=rss20","TASS","Mon- 28 Apr 2014 23-41-47 +0400","Shoigu denies Russian sabotage-reconnaissance groups operate in Ukraine","Shoigu denies Russian sabotage-reconnaissance groups operate in UkraineMOSCOW, April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu flatly denied “unfounded assertions” about the presence of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in Ukraine where they are allegedly destabilising the situation in south-eastern regions of the country.

In a telephone conversation on Monday, April 28, Shoigu and his U.S. counterpart Chuck Hagel “had a frank one-hour conversation and exchanged concerns about tensions in Ukraine”, the Defence Ministry press service said.

At the same time, Shoigu said that under the pretext of “fighting terrorism” the Kiev regime had amassed about 80 tanks, over 130 armoured personnel carriers and fighting vehicles, at least 60 artillery systems and mortars in the South-East of Ukraine. Combat aircraft and helicopters are engaged on a regular basis. The overall number of Ukrainian troops has reached 15,000 personnel, and “all this against the peaceful population of their own country”, the minister said.

“The possibility of forceful actions against peaceful people caused Russia to start large-scale manoeuvres on the national territory in regions bordering on Ukraine. This decision was made public,” he said. “However as soon as the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had no intention to use regular military units against unarmed people, the Russian units were ordered back to their bases.”

Shoigu said the increase in the activity of the U.S. and NATO armed forces in Eastern Europe near the Russian border was unprecedented and stressed that “these actions have been accompanied by provocative statements by the NATO Secretary-General on the need to ‘deter’ Russia,” the ministry said.

“The Russian Defence Minister also drew the attention of his American colleague to the anti-Russian hysteria unleashed lately in the Western press, which does not help to calm down passions,” the press centre said.

Hagel said these steps had been undertaken by Washington and Brussels in response to the situation in Ukraine but they were not provocative or expansionist and aimed to demonstrate the bloc unity and increased defence capabilities of the allies.

Shoigu reaffirmed his readiness to maintain contact with all sides concerned in order to de-escalate tensions in and around Ukraine.

He also “called for constructive dialogue and search for compromises on the basis of the Geneva accord of April 17”.

The minister also commented on the incidents in which two Russian Su-24 planes flew over the American destroyer Donald Cook in Black Sea on April 12 and a Russian Su-27 jet fighter escorted an American RC-135 plane over the Sea of Okhotsk on April 22.

Shoigu suggested instructing the chiefs of the Russian and American General Staff to discuss possible additional measures to avoid misinterpretation of each other’s actions in the future.

The minister and the secretary agreed to maintain “close contact”.","MOSCOW, April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu flatly denied “unfounded assertions” about the presence of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in Ukraine where they are allegedly destabilising the situation in south-eastern regions of the country.

In a telephone conversation on Monday, April 28, Shoigu and his U.S. counterpart Chuck Hagel “had a frank one-hour conversation and exchanged concerns about tensions in Ukraine”, the Defence Ministry press service said.

At the same time, Shoigu said that under the pretext of “fighting terrorism” the Kiev regime had amassed about 80 tanks, over 130 armoured personnel carriers and fighting vehicles, at least 60 artillery systems and mortars in the South-East of Ukraine. Combat aircraft and helicopters are engaged on a regular basis. The overall number of Ukrainian troops has reached 15,000 personnel, and “all this against the peaceful population of their own country”, the minister said.

“The possibility of forceful actions against peaceful people caused Russia to start large-scale manoeuvres on the national territory in regions bordering on Ukraine. This decision was made public,” he said. “However as soon as the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had no intention to use regular military units against unarmed people, the Russian units were ordered back to their bases.”

Shoigu said the increase in the activity of the U.S. and NATO armed forces in Eastern Europe near the Russian border was unprecedented and stressed that “these actions have been accompanied by provocative statements by the NATO Secretary-General on the need to ‘deter’ Russia,” the ministry said.

“The Russian Defence Minister also drew the attention of his American colleague to the anti-Russian hysteria unleashed lately in the Western press, which does not help to calm down passions,” the press centre said.

Hagel said these steps had been undertaken by Washington and Brussels in response to the situation in Ukraine but they were not provocative or expansionist and aimed to demonstrate the bloc unity and increased defence capabilities of the allies.

Shoigu reaffirmed his readiness to maintain contact with all sides concerned in order to de-escalate tensions in and around Ukraine.

He also “called for constructive dialogue and search for compromises on the basis of the Geneva accord of April 17”.

The minister also commented on the incidents in which two Russian Su-24 planes flew over the American destroyer Donald Cook in Black Sea on April 12 and a Russian Su-27 jet fighter escorted an American RC-135 plane over the Sea of Okhotsk on April 22.

American troops have arrived in Lithuania for military drills as tensions rise in the region over Ukraine. Russia has voiced its concern over the troop buildup in Eastern Europe as well as to the deployment of NATO ships in the Black Sea.


  The Lithuanian government welcomed the arrival of 150 troops at
  the Lithuanian Air Force Aviation Base in Siauliai on Saturday,
  reported Reuters. Referring to the escalating tensions in

  abating.

The European military observers detained by police in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk were not who they claimed to be and reported a false purpose of the visit, Ponomarev said earlier.

The detainees said they “have come on a sightseeing tour” but had a map marking the police’s positions, he said.

?Russia is not going to repeat “The Crimean scenario” in southeastern Ukraine, said the country’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov.

“I think what happened in Crimea turned out to be a big shock
  for Western partners. They can’t tolerate it. And they see the
  same scenario in southeastern Ukraine,” he told
  Gazeta.ru.


  According to Ryabkov, the Kiev authorities should give people
  from southeastern Ukraine a chance to participate in shaping the
  future of their own country.


“It’s a normal desire [to decide your country’s future]. It
  is the basis of any democratic process,” he added.



  Ryabkov says he doesn’t consider the protesters in Slavyansk and
  Donetsk, in Donetsk Region, as separatists.


“These are the people who insist on their rights, including
  the right to their language and access to information,” he
  said.



  According to Russian Deputy FM, the Kiev authorities and their
  “puppeteers in Washington and some European capitals”
  aren’t fulfilling the conditions of the April-17 Geneva
  agreements.


“They [Kiev and the West] claim that we [Russia] aren’t
  complying with the agreements but they haven’t shown any evidence
  that they are fulfilling them,” he said.



  He gave a reminder that the main issue surrounding these
  agreements is the disarmament of the Pravy Sektor (Right Sector)
  nationalist group and freeing seized streets and squares across
  Ukraine.



  However, Right Sector is still “running the show” in the
  streets of Ukraine, while Western countries only make claims and
  criticize anti-government protesters in the south-east, he added.



  Meanwhile, Ryabkov compared future sanctions on suspending US
  exports of high tech products to the Iron Curtain, an ideological
  conflict and physical boundary separating the Soviet Union from
  the other countries during the Cold War period.


“This [sanctions] is the revival of the system of 1949 when
  Western countries in fact drew “the iron curtain” on the import
  of high-tech products to the Soviet Union and other
  countries,” he said, “Now, in 2014 the US are trying to
  do the same.”


  However, despite all the sanctions issued by Western powers,
  Russia doesn’t want to break relations with either the EU, or the
  US.

  future of their own country.


“It’s a normal desire [to decide your country’s future]. It
  is the basis of any democratic process,” he added.



  Ryabkov says he doesn’t consider the protesters in Slavyansk and
  Donetsk, in Donetsk Region, as separatists.


“These are the people who insist on their rights, including
  the right to their language and access to information,” he
  said.



  According to Russian Deputy FM, the Kiev authorities and their
  “puppeteers in Washington and some European capitals”
  aren’t fulfilling the conditions of the April-17 Geneva
  agreements.


“They [Kiev and the West] claim that we [Russia] aren’t
  complying with the agreements but they haven’t shown any evidence
  that they are fulfilling them,” he said.



  He gave a reminder that the main issue surrounding these
  agreements is the disarmament of the Pravy Sektor (Right Sector)
  nationalist group and freeing seized streets and squares across
  Ukraine.



  However, Right Sector is still “running the show” in the
  streets of Ukraine, while Western countries only make claims and
  criticize anti-government protesters in the south-east, he added.



  Meanwhile, Ryabkov compared future sanctions on suspending US
  exports of high tech products to the Iron Curtain, an ideological
  conflict and physical boundary separating the Soviet Union from
  the other countries during the Cold War period.


“This [sanctions] is the revival of the system of 1949 when
  Western countries in fact drew “the iron curtain” on the import
  of high-tech products to the Soviet Union and other
  countries,” he said, “Now, in 2014 the US are trying to
  do the same.”


  However, despite all the sanctions issued by Western powers,
  Russia doesn’t want to break relations with either the EU, or the
  US.


“We have a lot of economic ties [with the US and EU]. People
  are working there,” he added.",455

Maj. Wilko Ter Horst said that the military learned around 3:50 p.m. (9:50 a.m. ET) that two Russian TU-95 bombers, known as Bears, had come a half-mile inside its airspace.

A pair of Dutch F-16 military jets were then dispatched to escort the Russian planes and ensure they (flew) out of our airspace, said Ter Horst, a Dutch military spokesman.

Such a sequence of events isn't uncommon, with the Netherlands military spokesman explaining this is a national procedure when aircraft infringe (on) national Dutch airspace. He estimated Dutch fighter jets scramble to check out unknown aircraft -- be they from Russia or another country -- about four or five times a year.

It is not unusual, Ter Horst added. Sometimes they cross Dutch airspace and sometimes they stay north of Dutch airspace (in the country's so-called area of responsibility).

In this case, British military aircraft took over from the Dutch in escorting the Russian planes.

A British Defense Ministry spokesman said that planes from his military left from Royal Air Force station Leuchars to determine the identity of unknown aircraft that approached the NATO Air Policing Area north of Scotland and could not be identified by other means.

These planes were later identified as the Russian military planes. The spokesman stressed that they didn't enter British airspace, nor has any Russian military plane ever done so.

The Russian military aircraft remained in international airspace at all times, as they are perfectly entitled to do, the spokesman said.

In a separate and standard event, Britain's HMS Dragon met up with the Russian ship Vice Admiral Kulakov as it was transiting past the UK, according to the military spokesman. The British naval destroyer is now keeping an eye on its transit south, he added.

There was no immediate mention of this story on the English-language versions of at least two Russian state-run media outlets, RT and RIA Novosti.

While British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said his military is always on alert to intercept any non-NATO forces, he did not portray these specific incidents as alarming.

Recent events have increased awareness of Russian military activity, Hammond said. But we have always routinely intercepted, identified and escorted Russian air and naval assets that transit international airspace and waters within the UK's 'area of interest.'

Both the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are part of NATO, which has been increasingly at odds with Russia over its activity in and around Ukraine.

The tensions ratcheted up late last year, when demonstrators pushed out Ukraine's president in part due to their anger about his moving away from an alliance with Europe and moving closer to Russia.

A pro-Western government took over in Kiev. Soon after, the Crimean peninsula seceded from Ukraine and became part of Russia.

Since then, Russia has deployed what NATO estimates to be 40,000 troops near its border with Ukraine, which has made other countries in the area nervous.

In an interview Wednesday with RT, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia would certainly respond if its interests were attacked in Ukraine.

Russian citizens being attacked is an attack against the Russian Federation, Lavrov said.

Although the NATO is to end its combat mission in Afghanistan later this year, challenges today remind the NATO members of the enduring need for the alliance and the need to strengthen it, said the Pentagon chief at an event in Washington on the NATO's future.

After more than a decade focused on counterinsurgency and stability operations, NATO must balance a new renewed emphasis on territorial defense with its unique expeditionary capabilities, because as we have seen, threats to the alliance neither start nor stop at Europe's doorstep, he said.

Hagel said Russia's actions in Ukraine have ushered in new realities and made NATO's value abundantly clear.

NATO must stand ready to visit the basic principles underlying its relationship with Russia, he added.

He called on NATO members to increase their financial contributions to the alliance, as the United States spends three times as much as the 27 other NATO members, which has been  increasingly disproportionate within the alliance.

Over time, this lopsided burden threatens NATO's integrity, cohesion, and capability -- and, ultimately, both European and transatlantic security, he said. We must see renewed financial commitments from all NATO members.

In addition to investment in militaries, Hagel said the U.S. and Europe must partner together to bolster energy security and blunt Russia's energy policies.","WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Friday renewed calls for members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to increase defense spending, following Russia's recent action in Ukraine that has reminded NATO of its founding purpose.

Like China, India too has supported Russia over the Ukraine/Crimea crisis. But there is a difference.


  As recently as the third week of April, India's top diplomat told
  the Russians to de-escalate tensions with the West over the
  Ukraine issue while conveying India's total understanding to the
  Russians on the subject.



  This was conveyed by Indian Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh to
  her Russian colleagues during an official visit to Moscow on
  April 15-17, her first independent visit to Russia since she took
  over last year. Singh co-chaired the India-Russia Foreign Office
  Consultations (FoCs) with her counterparts, Vladimir Titov, First
  Deputy Foreign Minister and Igor Morgulov, Deputy Foreign
  Minister, on April 16.



  Significantly, the Russians gave a detailed briefing to the
  Indians on the Ukraine situation and Moscow’s efforts to resolve
  the crisis. What has come out through official Indian channels
  about Singh's talks with her Russian counterparts is dense, full
  of clich?s and, therefore, needs to be decoded.



  First, the official Indian version.



  Sujatha Singh reiterated India’s position – calls on all sides to
  exercise restraint and work together constructively to find
  political and diplomatic solutions that would safeguard the
  legitimate interests of all sections of Ukraine’s population, of
  all countries in the region and promote long-term peace and
  stability in Europe and beyond. The two sides also discussed
  Russia’s then upcoming talks with Ukraine, USA and EU in Geneva
  on April 17.



  While reiterating its support for Moscow on Crimea’s merger with
  Russia, New Delhi stressed that India is for the unity and
  integrity of Ukraine, meaning while India is supportive of the
  Russian moves with regard to Crimea, New Delhi does not favor use
  of force by Russia against Ukraine. The Russian side told the
  Indians that it has no belligerent intentions against Ukraine.



  Significantly, Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the
  European Union successfully brokered an international agreement
  in Geneva on April 17. The deal envisages disarmament of armed
  groups in eastern Ukraine and a give-and-take with separatists:
  their vacation of occupied government buildings in exchange for a
  solemn assurance by the Ukraine government to grant total amnesty
  to separatists. The US too has agreed to delay another round of
  sanctions after Russia agreed not to intervene in Ukraine.



  However, on the flip side, international deals like the one in
  Geneva over Ukraine normally hang from a slender thread and many
  deal breakers may pop up any time. One such potential deal
  breaker is the continued defiance of the separatists in Donetsk
  who have taken the extreme step of declaring themselves as the
  independent Donetsk People's Republic. These
  separatists are pushing the envelope further by saying that they
  will not vacate the government buildings until the government in
  Kiev steps down.



  The Ukraine melting pot is set to make international news
  headlines in the coming days and weeks. There will be a laser
  beam focus on recently self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic
  whose leadership has declared its decision to hold a referendum
  simultaneously with east Ukraine’s Lugansk region. A total of 3.5
  million voters, living in the Donetsk Oblast, are eligible to
  take part in the referendum.



  Denis Pushilin, co-chairman of the Donetsk People’s Republic
  presidium, has gone on record as telling ITAR-TASS in an
  interview that Central and district election committees were
  already formed in Donetsk region and “printing of ballot
  papers will begin soon”.


  “A referendum will be held no later than on May 11 and it is
  highly probable that Lugansk will also hold it with us no later
  than on May 11. Lugansk just has to confirm similar wording of
  the question. Our question is as follows, “Do you support the
  independence of Donetsk People’s Republic?” Pushilin said in
  this interview.



  India to follow pragmatic diplomacy



  The Indian response to the Ukraine crisis has been pragmatic and
  will likely remain so even if Russia were to take extreme steps
  vis–?–vis Ukraine.



  For argument sake, let us consider the worst scenario: that
  Russia does bring its military forces into Ukraine. Even in such
  a scenario it is not likely that India would come up with a
  public condemnation of Russia. India would definitely come up
  with a statement, but its tone and tenor would hardly be
  hard-hitting. An Indian statement in such a scenario would only
  take the middle path, stressing the need for all stakeholders to
  resolve all issues through peaceful negotiations, and taking full
  care that India does not float an impression that it is wading
  into a Russia-West spat.



  India has far more at stake with Russia than with Ukraine. Even
  in the Russia versus the West scenario, India cannot ditch
  Russia. The Western world, led by the United States, has been
  mercurial and tried to balance India with Pakistan. The Russians
  have never done that and solidly supported India for the past
  four decades.



  In a way, India’s future response to the Ukraine developments has
  already been conveyed to Ukraine rather subtly.



  On February 28, at the peak of Russian actions in Crimea, the
  Ukraine ambassador in New Delhi, Oleksandr Shevchenko, met Dinkar
  Khullar, Secretary (West) in the Ministry of External Affairs.



  The Ukraine envoy made two requests: India’s support and the
  Indian recognition of the new government in Kiev.



  Unsurprisingly, the envoy returned empty handed. He was politely
  told that India will have to undertake internal consultations on
  the issue and formulate a stand, if required. As they say, speech
  is silver - silence golden!","India supports Russia over Crimea but stresses Ukraine integrity

Amid escalating tensions in Ukraine, the local population remains unclear who the army is ‘defending’. Latest video shows a taxi driver standing up to Ukrainian soldiers at Slavyansk checkpoint.


  A taxi driver confronted a military checkpoint in Ukraine’s
  eastern town of Slavyansk, asking the Interior Troops stationed
  there: “Who are you guarding against here?”


  In response he received a confused answer from one of the
  soldiers: “We've been doing that since December, nobody

  opposing the coup-appointed government in Kiev.



  Just last week five anti-government protesters reportedly were
  killed and one injured in Slavyansk after Kiev authorities sent

Naftogaz of Ukraine on Thursday, May 1, refused to recognise the debt of 11.4 billion U.S. dollars charged by Gazprom for taking less gas than required by the contract between the two companies.

“Gazprom’s demand contains a reference to the so-called take-or-pay clause which has not been a market practice for a long time the way the Russian gas monopoly insists. In addition, the contract between Naftogaz of Ukraine and Gazprom does not contain a mechanism for enforcing this clause,” the Naftogaz of Ukraine press service said.

Kiev’s debt has reached 2.2 billion U.S. dollars since January 2014 and will reach 3.5 billion U.S. dollars by the middle of May when the next payment is due.

Naftogaz of Ukraine’s overall debt to Gazprom for taking less gas than required under the take-or-pay contract is about 18.5 billion U.S. dollars.

Gazprom charged Naftogaz of Ukraine 11.388 billion U.S. dollars for taking less gas than had been contracted in 2013: the Ukrainian company too only 12.9 billion of the required 41.6 billion cubic metres.

Ukraine is ready to pay the price of 268 U.S. dollars per 1,000 cubic metres of Russian gas, parliament-appointed Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk said.

This is 45% below the established price of gas. If Moscow disagrees, Kiev will be prepared to contest its debt in court, he said.

Yatsenyuk told reporters that a “note” had been sent to Russia’s Gazprom, which “states the price”. If Gazprom accepts the proposed terms, Ukraine will pay the gas debt of 2.2 billion U.S. dollars immediately. If no solution is found within 30 days, the dispute will be taken to court.

“We have come to agreement on a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the EU and Russia to settle the gas conflict. But I would like to recall that Ukraine has sent a pre-arbitration claim to Gazprom. If the positions are not reconciled and Ukraine’s demands are not met within 29 days, we will meet in Stockholm’s international court of arbitration,” he said.

“The government invites Gazprom to meet on neutral ground in London and discuss all issues. We will defend the interests of Ukraine using all lawful methods and the best lawful method is the court in Stockholm,” Yatsenyuk said.","KIEV, May 01, /ITAR-TASS/.

Russia has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the EU's so-called 'Third Energy Package,' according to media reports.

“This procedure is provided for in the rules of the
  Organization,” a source said, adding that “Russia sent a note to
  the EU Mission at the WTO and notified the WTO Secretariat
  thereof,” Itar-Tass news agency reported.



  A second news agency, Interfax, stated that a “source close
  to WTO” spoke of “the start [of a] court
  examination.” The agency said it obtained confirmation from
  the director of the Ministry of Economic Development’s department
  of trade negotiations, Maksim Medvedkov.



  Signed in 2007, the Third Energy Package outlines a set of rules
  regulating the European gas and electricity market. The European
  Commission insists the Third Energy Package was aimed at
  increasing competition on the energy market, allowing other
  players to join the sector and liberalizing energy prices.



  One of the core elements prohibits a single company from both
  owning and operating a gas pipeline and contains rules on third
  party access to the natural oil transportation grid.


“These and other elements of the Third Energy Package, in the
  opinion of Russia, contradict the obligations of the EU in WTO on
  basic principles of non-discrimination and market access...the
  Third Energy Package creates serious obstacles to ensure a stable
  supply of Russian gas to the EU, including a threat to the
  construction of new transport infrastructure, for example, in the
  framework of the ‘South Stream,'” Medvedkov told Interfax.



  Moscow broke ground on the South Stream project after securing
  agreements with intergovernmental agreements with all countries
  which the pipeline would pass through: Austria, Bulgaria,
  Hungary, Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, and Croatia.



  The Third Energy regulation mandates 50 percent of the pipeline
  can be operated by Russia's Gazprom, but the other 50 percent
  must be operated by a third party, a condition Russian energy
  ministers do not accept, as Gazprom is the only company that has
  the right to export gas via pipeline.



  Russian President Vladimir Putin previously stated that the
  Third Energy Package and other documents “should not be
  backdated to the contracts that were signed before the decision
  on the Third Energy Package came into force.”



  Medvedkov has stressed that Russia has unsuccessfully tried to
  solve “emerging problems” on a bilateral level.



  Now, under WTO rules, Russia and the EU have 60 days to hold
  joint consultations. If no solution is found during this time,
  Moscow can demand the right to initiate the creation of a group
  of independent arbitrators to look into the case.



  However, Medvedkov has not ruled out the possibility of Russia
  and the EU reaching an agreement during consultations.


“We do not aim to have legal proceedings with Brussels for
  the sake of the judicial process, we want to ensure predictable
  conditions for export to the EU under WTO rules,” he said.



  The Third Energy Package is a set of regulations for an internal
  gas and electricity market in the European Union. Its purpose is
  to further expand the gas and electricity markets in the European
  Union. The package was proposed by the European Commission in
  September 2007 and adopted by the European Parliament and the
  Council of the European Union in July 2009. It entered into force

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry alleged that the presence of army units in the east of the country is solely aimed at the protection of citizens.

In a press release on Wednesday, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said it believed Russia should immediately move away its troops from the border with Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with the RT news channel on Wednesday that “we never denied that we moved additional troops on the border, just like Ukrainian authorities moved their troops closer to the Russian border because they moved them to the east and south regions.”

He also stressed that Russia had been conducting military exercises in different regions of the country on a regular basis, since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister.

“The only thing I would like to highlight at this stage is that the Russian troops are on the Russian territory, the requests for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document 2011 and under the treaty of the Open Sky, they all have been granted,” he said.

In a press release on Wednesday, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said it believed Russia should immediately move away its troops from the border with Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with the RT news channel on Wednesday that “we never denied that we moved additional troops on the border, just like Ukrainian authorities moved their troops closer to the Russian border because they moved them to the east and south regions.”

He also stressed that Russia had been conducting military exercises in different regions of the country on a regular basis, since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister.

“The only thing I would like to highlight at this stage is that the Russian troops are on the Russian territory, the requests for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document 2011 and under the treaty of the Open Sky, they all have been granted,” he said.

A letter obtained by Reuters which was sent to several U.N. Security Council members this month by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in Syria says a lack of coordination by the United Nations means assistance is not reaching some civilians in priority areas.

In other regions of the country the U.N. does not inform other aid groups when it brings aid, leading to potential duplication of deliveries, the document said.

Syria's war has killed 150,000 people and poses an enormous challenge for relief workers. Nine million people inside the country need aid and protection, industry and agriculture are failing, and 2.5 million refugees have fled abroad.

Funding shortfalls combined with restrictions imposed by Damascus and by the fighting have hampered relief efforts.

But the NGOs suggested that shortcomings in the aid operations were aggravating the situation, calling on the United Nations to demonstrate greater leadership, improve coordination and demand better access.

U.N. officials in New York, Geneva and Damascus declined to comment on the NGO report, but U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos has repeatedly said the Syrian government and rebels have not done enough to allow aid in to besieged areas.

President Bashar al-Assad's forces and to a lesser extent rebels fighting to overthrow him have been accused of preventing food and medicine from reaching a quarter of a million people in besieged areas, seeking to starve opponents into submission.

Syrian authorities also frequently dictate how aid is distributed by U.N. agencies, who are legally obliged to work with the country's authorities, resulting in more supplies going to government-controlled areas, aid workers say.

Seeking to expand the humanitarian reach, the U.N. Security Council agreed in February that all sides must allow greater access. But U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week none of Syria's warring parties was adhering to the demand.

WEAK U.N. SYSTEMS

Reuters spoke to three international aid organization that drafted the report to Security Council members. The organizations asked to remain anonymous, citing fears that public disclosure would negatively affect their work in Syria.

U.N. agencies ... need to ensure better coordination and leadership, the report said.

Coordination between aid agencies operating from neighboring countries and those present in Damascus continues to be challenging, with weak U.N. systems and insufficient capacity currently in place.

In Damascus, NGOs are often excluded from decision-making processes related to the planning of aid convoys and discussions on aid delivery mechanisms, it said.

The report said aid groups did not take part in a government and U.N. meetings during the evacuation of civilians from besieged areas of Homs city this year. That kind of exclusion means that information and analysis from a broader range of aid actors are often not taken on board, it said.

Greater U.N. action to press for diplomatic support on key access issues is needed, it added, repeating a long-standing criticism that the U.N. has not voiced concerns loud enough when Syrian authorities impede access, such as restricting aid to besieged areas.

Amos, who is due to brief the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, has appealed to the council for more than a year for help in increasing humanitarian access.

Diplomats say that it will be tough, however, for the council to take further action. Russia, supported by China, has shielded its ally Syria on the Security Council during the war. They had previously vetoed three resolutions that would have condemned Syria's government and threatened it with possible sanctions.

BORDER AREAS

A representative of an international NGO that works in Syria and neighboring countries said the U.N. should complement ongoing operations, not undermine them.

That's a concern at the moment, that a lack of coordination between the U.N. and organizations already working on the ground means they're sometimes doing more harm than good, he said.

Ban Ki-moon's recent report (on aid access) was strong, but frustratingly it barely mentioned the challenges that NGOs have faced in delivering aid cross border and cross line in Syria.

The report, dated April 16, said U.N. agencies are not directly providing critical humanitarian support to millions of Syrians across borders, one of the main demands which the Security Council resolution put to Syrian authorities.

On March 20, U.N. aid trucks crossed from Turkey into Syria for the first time. But the report said the operation allowed virtually no assistance to reach civilians in opposition-controlled areas.

It said that delays in sharing U.N. plans meant that aid during the cross-border operation was duplicated as other humanitarian groups were also distributing there.

There are eight formal border crossings between Syria and Turkey and the one used, Qamishli, is the only one where there are government forces in the area. Damascus has made clear it will not allow crossings through rebel-held border posts.

We need the help of the U.N. to really scale up that operation and meet the huge demand for help. There are 7 million people living in areas that can only really be accessed with any ease from border countries, the representative said.

The Foreign Ministry said on Thursday the diplomat had been detained a day earlier and declared persona non grata.

Ukraine's security service said he was a Russian intelligence officer who had been collecting intelligence on Ukrainian-NATO military and political cooperation.

On April 30, he was caught red-handed receiving classified material from his source, said Maryna Ostapenko, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's security service, the SBU. She described the source as a colonel in the Ukrainian armed forces.

Ukraine says Russia stands behind the fall of towns and cities over the past month in the country's industrial east to pro-Russian separatists, often involving well-organized masked gunmen in military fatigues.

Russia denies having any part in the rebellion, but has warned it reserves the right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians - following its annexation of Crimea in late March - and has massed tens of thousands of troops on its western frontier with Ukraine.

Ostapenko said the attach?© had been handed over to the Russian embassy and ordered to leave, though she was not sure if he had yet done so.

There was no immediate response from Moscow, which like Kiev was observing the May 1 holiday.

Ukraine's pro-Western leaders conceded on Wednesday they were helpless to counter the fall of government buildings and police stations to the separatists in the Donbass coal and steel belt, source of around a third of the country's industrial output.

PROVOCATIONS

Having seized key buildings in the capital of the easternmost province, Luhansk, on Tuesday, gunmen took control at dawn on Wednesday in the nearby towns of Horlivka and Alchevsk. Thursday was relatively quiet.

Following a now familiar pattern, local media reported that some 30 armed men had seized the town hall in the small town of Amvrosiivka near the border, home to around 19,000 people, and forced the mayor to sign his resignation. They hoisted the Russian tricolor.

In Donetsk, the biggest city to fall with around 1 million people, mainly Russian-speaking separatists have declared a People's Republic of Donetsk and called a referendum on secession for May 11, threatening to undercut a planned presidential election in Ukraine two weeks later.

Ukraine hopes the presidential poll will help restore order after five months of civil turmoil that saw Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich toppled after street protests and gun battles in central Kiev, and Russia's subsequent annexation of the Crimean peninsula.

Pro-Western authorities that took power with Yanukovich's overthrow accuse Russia of planning to disrupt the presidential election, create instability and frustrate the new government's hopes of Western integration.

Overnight, the state security guard, responsible for securing key government sites and officials, carried out a small drill in central Kiev. Four armored personnel carriers trundled through the streets to parliament, where several dozen troops took position as if responding to a threat.

The guard's commander, Valery Galetey, said they were training for possible provocations during the May 25 election.

The second wave of US sanctions against Russian officials and the heated rhetoric exchange between the leaders of both countries, with each side blaming the other, show without a doubt that US-Russia relations have bottomed out.


  It is time to abandon political posturing and introduce some
  rationality to the discussion. The stakes are too high to allow
  this confrontation between Washington and Moscow to continue, as
  the consequences are unpredictable.



  The violent chaos spreading in Ukraine has the potential to spark
  a much wider conflict in Europe on a scale not seen since 1945.
  The expansion of NATO military hardware and personnel along
  Russia's borders and the threats of further devastating Western
  sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy are pushing us
  towards a nightmare scenario that neither the US nor its European
  allies are prepared to face.



  A certain modicum of cynicism and hypocrisy is perhaps
  unavoidable in foreign policy, but choosing to overlook any of
  the interim Kiev government's wrongdoings, and blaming every
  instance of violence on Russian provocateurs exceeds these limits
  – or, to borrow from US President Barack Obama's parlance,
  crosses every red line.



  It is true that some opposing views occasionally penetrate the
  Western media's wall of anti-Russian consensus, but their numbers
  are as few as those of Soviet-era dissidents in a KGB-dominated
  state.



  The recent Geneva agreement was a step in the right direction,
  but it has not changed the untenable situation on the ground. The
  real question now is who is going to put it into effect?



  For example, Kiev has not followed through on its promise to
  disarm illegally armed militant groups – such as the nationalist
  Right Sector paramilitary group – which was one of the vital
  points of the Geneva deal. Nor does it show any inclination that
  it will do so any time soon.



  The greatest danger here is that Ukraine is edging closer and
  closer toward a full-scale civil war by the day. But there is an
  even greater danger of the conflict escalating into a direct
  military confrontation between US-led NATO forces and Russia, a
  scenario with the most horrific consequences for both sides.



  A NATO intervention in Ukraine, followed by a reciprocal move by
  Russia, is not a desirable outcome. Therefore, as tensions rise
  and the conditions in Ukraine continue to deteriorate,
  policymakers in Washington and Moscow need to recognize the
  extremely urgent need to find a means of extricating themselves
  from this crisis. This should be done before it transforms from a
  regional crisis to a full-blown international conflagration.



  During a recent interview, President Vladimir Putin offered
  Washington an opportunity to break this futile cycle of mutual
  accusation and ineffectual posturing. I think there is
  nothing that would hinder normalization and normal cooperation
  with the West. This does not depend on us, or rather not only on
  us. This depends on our partners, said Putin. In the same
  interview he welcomed the appointment of former Norwegian Prime
  Minister Jens Stoltenberg as the next NATO secretary-general.



  Regardless of your opinion of Putin, since first taking office 15
  years ago he has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness and
  ability to constructively cooperate with the US on major issues.
  Even today, crucial US air supplies to the NATO-backed security
  forces in Afghanistan are made easier by Russia, which provides
  secure access via its Northern Air Corridor. Both nations share
  the same security concerns with regard to the spread of nuclear
  weapons and terror threats from radical Islamists.



  To be sure, it is Washington that holds practically all the keys
  to a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. Not only has it
  helped to install the present government but, judging from the
  incessant visits of senior US officials to Kiev, it is they who
  are calling the shots.



  Kiev's actions, paired with Washington's threat of additional
  sanctions and failure to push for a compromise by implementing
  the Geneva agreement, raise the fears that we are quickly moving
  toward a situation that both sides might end up deeply
  regretting.

The second wave of US sanctions against Russian officials and the heated rhetoric exchange between the leaders of both countries, with each side blaming the other, show without a doubt that US-Russia relations have bottomed out.


  It is time to abandon political posturing and introduce some
  rationality to the discussion. The stakes are too high to allow
  this confrontation between Washington and Moscow to continue, as
  the consequences are unpredictable.



  The violent chaos spreading in Ukraine has the potential to spark
  a much wider conflict in Europe on a scale not seen since 1945.
  The expansion of NATO military hardware and personnel along
  Russia's borders and the threats of further devastating Western
  sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy are pushing us
  towards a nightmare scenario that neither the US nor its European
  allies are prepared to face.



  A certain modicum of cynicism and hypocrisy is perhaps
  unavoidable in foreign policy, but choosing to overlook any of
  the interim Kiev government's wrongdoings, and blaming every
  instance of violence on Russian provocateurs exceeds these limits
  – or, to borrow from US President Barack Obama's parlance,
  crosses every red line.



  It is true that some opposing views occasionally penetrate the
  Western media's wall of anti-Russian consensus, but their numbers
  are as few as those of Soviet-era dissidents in a KGB-dominated
  state.



  The recent Geneva agreement was a step in the right direction,
  but it has not changed the untenable situation on the ground. The
  real question now is who is going to put it into effect?



  For example, Kiev has not followed through on its promise to
  disarm illegally armed militant groups – such as the nationalist
  Right Sector paramilitary group – which was one of the vital
  points of the Geneva deal. Nor does it show any inclination that
  it will do so any time soon.



  The greatest danger here is that Ukraine is edging closer and
  closer toward a full-scale civil war by the day. But there is an
  even greater danger of the conflict escalating into a direct
  military confrontation between US-led NATO forces and Russia, a
  scenario with the most horrific consequences for both sides.



  A NATO intervention in Ukraine, followed by a reciprocal move by
  Russia, is not a desirable outcome. Therefore, as tensions rise
  and the conditions in Ukraine continue to deteriorate,
  policymakers in Washington and Moscow need to recognize the
  extremely urgent need to find a means of extricating themselves
  from this crisis. This should be done before it transforms from a
  regional crisis to a full-blown international conflagration.



  During a recent interview, President Vladimir Putin offered
  Washington an opportunity to break this futile cycle of mutual
  accusation and ineffectual posturing. I think there is
  nothing that would hinder normalization and normal cooperation
  with the West. This does not depend on us, or rather not only on
  us. This depends on our partners, said Putin. In the same
  interview he welcomed the appointment of former Norwegian Prime
  Minister Jens Stoltenberg as the next NATO secretary-general.



  Regardless of your opinion of Putin, since first taking office 15
  years ago he has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness and
  ability to constructively cooperate with the US on major issues.
  Even today, crucial US air supplies to the NATO-backed security
  forces in Afghanistan are made easier by Russia, which provides
  secure access via its Northern Air Corridor. Both nations share
  the same security concerns with regard to the spread of nuclear
  weapons and terror threats from radical Islamists.



  To be sure, it is Washington that holds practically all the keys
  to a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. Not only has it
  helped to install the present government but, judging from the
  incessant visits of senior US officials to Kiev, it is they who
  are calling the shots.



  Kiev's actions, paired with Washington's threat of additional
  sanctions and failure to push for a compromise by implementing
  the Geneva agreement, raise the fears that we are quickly moving
  toward a situation that both sides might end up deeply
  regretting.

Ukraine's parliament will make a new attempt on Thursday to coordinate the memorandum on settling the situation in the east of the country, along with the bill to amnesty participants in the protests that swept across the eastern regions.

Though the documents are not formally on the Thursday agenda, lawmakers said they would be added as soon as a consensus was reached between the opposition /the Party of Regions and the Communists/ and the coalition comprising the Batkivshchina, UDAR, and Svoboda factions and two groups of lawmakers.

On Wednesday, the heads of the factions failed to reach an accord on the bill on amnesty for protesters in the east of the country. At present, six alternative documents are offered for review in parliament. The cabinet submitted its own bill on inadmissibility of prosecution for the events during mass actions of civil confrontation that began on February 22, 2014.

The Party of Regions, in the bill of its own, called for amnestying all those who had captured administrative buildings in eastern regions, as the new authorities had amnestied the protesters on Kiev's Independence Square.

However, the coalition which called the Maidan supporters patriots denounced protesters in the east as separatists. It said it would object to exempting from punishment all the participants in the protests in the Donetsk, Lugansk and Kharkov regions.

Nor can the parliamentary factions come to terms on the memorandum on settling the situation in the east. Acting head of Batkivshchina Sergei Sobolev said that the Party of Regions and the Communists had snubbed with the document drawn by the coalition. At present, there is actually no support from the Party of Regions or the Communists for the draft of the memorandum of mutual understanding, brought forward by speaker of Verkhovnaya Rada /parliament/ and the heads of the factions of the parliamentary majority, Sobolev said.

Speaker Alexander Turchinov's document contains several provisions which the opposition flatly rejects. The document does not envision federalization, broader powers for regions, official status for other languages in certain regions and amendments to the Constitution.

Last week, the coalition tried to put Turchinov's document on the agenda, but it failed short of the required 226 votes. Lawmakers came close to the format of passing the memorandum, but had not reached a consensus yet, the speaker said in comments on the situation.

The Party of Regions drew its own version of the memorandum. Together with the Communists, it calls for fixing in the Constitution the status of Russian as the second state language. They also offered to immediately adopt the laws on reform of local self rule and regional governance. Specifically, the document proposes replacing regional and district state administrations with executive committees of regional and district councils and delegating executive powers to them.

The Party of regions also insists on direct elections of chairpersons of regional councils by regional communities in an open vote by residents, and on providing necessary funding to regions through the establishment of fair distribution of budget revenue.

Local authorities in the east of the country support these demands. For example, deputies of the Kharkov Town Council asked Ukrainian lawmakers to pass a law on local referenda to realize people's right to the expression of will. We, the legitimately elected representatives of Kharkov, support Kharkov residents' rights to the expression of their views and peaceful actions, the deputies said in a statement.

They also said they were at one with regional residents' position voiced during an opinion pool in Kharkov in 2002 on using Russian together with the state language in all spheres of public life. Kharkov Town Council also asked the parliament to take measures aimed at restoring citizens' constitutional rights to information, and ensure the resumption of broadcasting of Russian television channels.

Kiev-appointed chairman of the Donetsk region state administration /OGA/ Sergei Taruta called for all-Ukrainian referendum on the status of the Russian language and decentralisation of Ukraine.

People want the referendum and should be given the opportunity to hold it. I suggest setting the date for May 25, the day of Ukrainian presidential election, Taruta said.

He believes it is necessary to begin to formulate questions for the referendum as soon as possible, in order to secure accord between all the interested parties.

“Notably, the level of political approval to those in power, and hence the political stability, is unprecedented in the face of Western sanctions. This is sort of a gift to President Putin and it is up to him now to use it wisely,” he said, explaining that this kind of national accord was unthinkable just a little over a year ago.

Together with the new phase of sanctions, the European Commission said it is working on the next phase of stricter limitations targeting Russia’s economy. Eskin dismissed speculation on possible sanctions, focusing on those measures that are already in force.

“I wouldn’t want to speculate about possible further sanctions, but the current ones are, essentially, a ‘cure’ for Russia’s longstanding economic illness,” Eskin said.

“Russia has been lacking a mobilization factor much needed to reform the resource-driven and export-oriented economy into a system focused on manufacturing and services. The Western actions and what Ukraine is doing would be that necessary mobilization factor,” he said, stressing that history has shown countries have been able to emerge out of isolationist attacks stronger and more resilient.

Speaking on more specific consequences of the sanctions, Eskin mentioned the return of Russian capital into the country as a way to offset capital flight from risk-averse foreign investors.

“This would also make for appropriate circumstances for the return of capital to the country, as no Russian businessman is currently confident in what is to happen to their money abroad, which would re-direct capital back into Russia,” he said.

Eskin said that the wording chosen for sanctions aims to stress that those decision-makers “in charge” of Crimean reunification should be “held responsible,” although, in fact, these very people deserve a “thank you,” rather than a punishment.

“The territorial transformations associated with Crimea can only evoke gratitude to those in charge. Never has a transformation of such kind been so bloodless. The people yearned for reunification and their will was fulfilled. In this respect, it is very difficult to understand the grounds for criticism against Moscow,” he explained.

On Monday, the US imposed sanctions against 7 Russian individuals and 17 Russian companies, accusing Moscow of failing to meet its commitments under the Geneva accords and further escalating the crisis.

On Tuesday, the European Union also imposed sanctions on 15 additional Russian and Ukrainian officials. Most of those listed in the EU sanctions expand on the US list.

Later that day, Japan also announced additional sanctions against Russia over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Tokyo said it will deny visas to 23 Russian nationals, including government officials, amid Moscow’s lack of visible action to reduce tensions in Ukraine.

Gerges holds the Emirates Chair in Contemporary Middle Eastern Studies at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He is author of several books, including The New Middle East: Social Protest and Revolution in the Arab World. The views expressed in this commentary are entirely his own.

(CNN) -- As Iraqis count the votes following the first parliamentary elections since U.S. troops withdrew from the country at the end of 2011, they agree on one thing: the fierce urgency of change. Although the vote is an important milestone in Iraq's fragile state, it is unlikely to resolve the country's severe political crisis and generate a new social contract and a constitution that enshrine equal citizenship before the rule of law.

At the heart of Iraq's structural crisis lies a dysfunctional political system based on muhasasa or distribution of power along communal, ethnic and tribal lines, a system put in place after the U.S. invaded and occupied the country in 2003.

Ever since, the dominant social groups have fought over the division of political spoils, unwilling to put the interests of the nation over their own sects and tribes. Although the rules of the game influence the conduct of the political class, politicians of all colors (Shiites, Sunni Arabs and Sunni Kurds) have not transcended their narrow parochial concerns and have not risen up to the historic challenge. Iraq faces a two-pronged systemic and leadership challenge.

The ruling political class is as much responsible for Iraq's predicament as structural conditions. The structure is not destiny. Having taken ownership of the country after U.S. occupation and ouster of Saddam Hussein, the Shiite leadership has treated Sunni Arabs like second-class citizens and has equated its numerical majority with a license to monopolize power at the expense of others.

In a similar vein, the Sunni leadership has not come to terms with the new realities of post-Saddam Iraq and still entertains illusions about ruling Iraq. Kurdish leaders would not mind if Iraq burns as long as they preserve a separate Kurdistan -- a quasi-independent entity.

Of all actors, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki bears greater responsibility for the steep deterioration of the security situation and the quality of life of Iraqis, including corruption that infects all aspects of Iraqi society. After eight years in office and monopolizing power, al-Maliki has failed his countrymen and has delivered neither security nor prosperity. He was blind and deaf to the gathering storm among Sunnis Arabs who feel excluded by what they view as his sectarian-based policies.

Under his watch, al Qaeda factions -- or the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Greater Syria) known by its Arabic acronym, Daish -- has revived and found shelter among dissatisfied Sunnis. Indeed, Iraq is deeply polarized along social, ideological and communal lines, witnessing a resilient Sunni insurgency in late 2012 that has exacted a heavy human toll and has almost plunged the country to the brink of civil war.

Since last May, almost 1,000 civilians get killed each month and the insurgents, a mix of tribesmen and al Qaeda extremists, control neighborhoods of the provincial capital, Ramadi, and nearly all of the nearby city of Fallujah.

The conflict in Syria has aggravated communal tensions in Iraq and polarized the country further. It is now almost forgotten that the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham established al-Nusra Front in Syria, al Qaeda's official arm, and built a potent jihadist infrastructure in the war-torn country. The two insurgencies in Syria and Iraq feed on one another and supply the fuel that powers their deadly engines.

Yet al-Maliki, who leads the mainly Shiite State of Law Coalition, is shamelessly running on a triumphant slogan presenting himself as a strong Shiite leader who can defeat al Qaeda. Together, we defeat terrorism, one of his campaign posters declares.

Instead of pledging to form a genuine national unity government that tackles Iraq's structural problems, al-Maliki is also asking voters to give him an absolute majority to form a stronger central rule, as if he has not already accumulated too much power, blaming weak governance on political rivals who blocked his efforts.

Partnership with other political factions has hampered the government performance, al-Maliki told his supporters during a campaign rally in Babil province south of Baghdad.

It is doubtful if either al-Maliki's coalition or any other would gain an outright electoral majority because of the extent of inter- and intra-communal fragmentation. More than 9,000 candidates from nearly 280 political entities are vying for 328 seats in parliament.

Not unlike the last parliamentary vote in 2010, intra-sectarian Shiite rivalries mark this round. The prime minister's bloc is challenged by The Citizen Coalition, led by Ammar al-Hakim of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, Ammar al-Hakim, and the Ahrar Coalition, formed by followers of the Islamist populist Sadrist Movement. Although in 2010 Iran played a key role in convincing al-Hakim and al-Sadr to back al-Maliki and provide him with a majority to form a government, it might not be able to do so now given that the gulf among the three reluctant Shiite allies has widened. Sunni Arabs are as divided as the Shiites.

In a consolidated democracy, electoral division would produce a broadly-based coalition government. Not so in Iraq's case, a fragile country with deep sociological rifts, dysfunctional political system, and absence of a viable progressive non-sectarian alternative. Far from beginning the complex process of nation-building and social reconstruction, an urgent task, the vote would likely prolong the crisis of authority and legitimation.

Many Iraqis whom I speak to say they have low expectations of the vote; they are cynical about the politicians who promise deliverance but fall far too short. I have not met a single Iraqi who believes that the elections would signal either a new beginning, a different direction, or inject fresh blood in the veins of the cloaked body politic.

Rather more modestly, Iraqis hope that the new leadership will prevent the country from sliding to all-out war and putting its house in order.

Sanctions against Russia will backfire and actually benefit the economy, President Vladimir Putin has said. His comments follow US President Obama’s threat that the White House has prepared a third round of sanctions.

“Over-reliance can lead to a loss of sovereignty,” Putin
  said at a media forum in St. Petersburg on Thursday.



  Western-led sanctions have several advantages for Russia, the
  President said.



  The threat of real economic sanctions is already helping boost
  domestic businesses, bringing more offshore funds back to Russia,
  and giving policymakers the push they need to establish a
  domestic payment system. Similar to what Prime Minister Medvedev
  said last week, sanctions will only make Russia stronger.


De-offshorization
  has long been a priority of the Kremlin, and Western-led
  sanctions only help this cause.



  Russians with Western-held assets worry their funds could be
  frozen at any moment, which gives incentives to keep money
  domestically and pay taxes into the Russian budget, and not an
  offshore tax haven. An estimated $111 billion of Russian money, or 20 percent of the
  country’s exports, is lost offshore,



  Policymakers are also encouraging businesses to list their companies in Russia, and not abroad, to
  shield themselves from sanctions.



  The first wave of US sanctions prompted a mix-up with Visa and
  Mastercard, which led to unlawful blocked payment freezes at three Russian
  banks in March. Services shortly resumed, but President Putin thinks the
  disruption will lead to losses for the two giant credit card
  companies.



  According to Putin, this was a “very big mistake”.



  Putin said he believes the Visa and MasterCard payment systems
  will lose their market share in Russia -currently 90 percent-
  over any future payment disruptions.


“I’m sure they are already aware of this,” the president
  said.


“I’m not talking about some administrative steps from our
  side. We do not envision any punishment steps for our dishonest
  partners. But they are undermining our credibility in them, which
  means they are absolutely certain to be losing market
  share, the president added.



  Putin is worried that the payment systems will continue to
  “cave” under US pressure.



  Third Round of Sanctions



  On Wednesday, US President Obama said the US is ready to unleash
  a third round of sanctions against Russia, as tensions in eastern
  Ukraine haven’t deescalated, as agreed upon in last week’s Geneva
  peace plan.



  New sanctions by the United States and Europe will likely target
  specific industries- like energy and banking
  
  While sanctions against Russia have had some negative effects on
  the Russian economy, like a ratings cut and loans becoming more
  expensive, it hasn't been dramatic, Putin said.


On the whole, probably, [ratings] cause harm, because
  ratings are reviewed and loans can become more expensive,
  etc.,” Putin said.



  So far, two agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch have
  downgraded Russia's credit rating over the potential impact of US
  and EU sanctions.



  Forecasters have cut their estimates for Russian growth in 2014,
  with the best case scenario at 2.5 precent, and the worst,
  0

Sanctions against Russia will backfire and actually benefit the economy, President Vladimir Putin has said. His comments follow US President Obama’s threat that the White House has prepared a third round of sanctions.

“Over-reliance can lead to a loss of sovereignty,” Putin
  said at a media forum in St. Petersburg on Thursday.



  Western-led sanctions have several advantages for Russia, the
  President said.



  The threat of real economic sanctions is already helping boost
  domestic businesses, bringing more offshore funds back to Russia,
  and giving policymakers the push they need to establish a
  domestic payment system. Similar to what Prime Minister Medvedev
  said last week, sanctions will only make Russia stronger.


De-offshorization
  has long been a priority of the Kremlin, and Western-led
  sanctions only help this cause.



  Russians with Western-held assets worry their funds could be
  frozen at any moment, which gives incentives to keep money
  domestically and pay taxes into the Russian budget, and not an
  offshore tax haven. An estimated $111 billion of Russian money, or 20 percent of the
  country’s exports, is lost offshore,



  Policymakers are also encouraging businesses to list their companies in Russia, and not abroad, to
  shield themselves from sanctions.



  The first wave of US sanctions prompted a mix-up with Visa and
  Mastercard, which led to unlawful blocked payment freezes at three Russian
  banks in March. Services shortly resumed, but President Putin thinks the
  disruption will lead to losses for the two giant credit card
  companies.



  According to Putin, this was a “very big mistake”.



  Putin said he believes the Visa and MasterCard payment systems
  will lose their market share in Russia -currently 90 percent-
  over any future payment disruptions.


“I’m sure they are already aware of this,” the president
  said.


“I’m not talking about some administrative steps from our
  side. We do not envision any punishment steps for our dishonest
  partners. But they are undermining our credibility in them, which
  means they are absolutely certain to be losing market
  share, the president added.



  Putin is worried that the payment systems will continue to
  “cave” under US pressure.



  Third Round of Sanctions



  On Wednesday, US President Obama said the US is ready to unleash
  a third round of sanctions against Russia, as tensions in eastern
  Ukraine haven’t deescalated, as agreed upon in last week’s Geneva
  peace plan.



  New sanctions by the United States and Europe will likely target
  specific industries- like energy and banking
  
  While sanctions against Russia have had some negative effects on
  the Russian economy, like a ratings cut and loans becoming more
  expensive, it hasn't been dramatic, Putin said.


On the whole, probably, [ratings] cause harm, because
  ratings are reviewed and loans can become more expensive,
  etc.,” Putin said.



  So far, two agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch have
  downgraded Russia's credit rating over the potential impact of US
  and EU sanctions.



  Forecasters have cut their estimates for Russian growth in 2014,
  with the best case scenario at 2.5 precent, and the worst,
  0
  percent.

They should clearly understand the measure of their responsibility if the situation in Ukraine continues to aggravate,” he said.

The diplomat recalled that at the meeting in Geneva with the participation of Russia, Ukraine, the United States and European Union the parties reached an agreement on “zero tolerance to extremists” and on their disarmament. “Neither the Right Sector that is marching under Nazi banners nor other radical organisations are laying down arms,” the diplomat said. “On the contrary, they have begun to legalise these groups, forming from them the Dnepr, Slobozhanshchina and Donbass paramilitary battalions,” he said.

Churkin sharply criticised diplomats of other countries who spoke at the meeting, including the US and British, who stated that Kiev was fully complying with its obligations under the Geneva agreement. However, in the view of US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, Russia is doing nothing to influence the “separatists” in the southeast of Ukraine.

“NATO attempts to use the situation in Ukraine to resolve the old problems of the alliance,” Polikanov said.

“By referring to the Russian threat and the need to ensure collective defense, NATO tries to consolidate the trans-Atlantic link and to convince the European members to spend more on common security,” he added.

US Secretary of State John Kerry called on NATO members to increase their defense spending following the events unfolding in Ukraine, which he deemed “a wake-up call.”

“We cannot continue to allow allied defense budgets to shrink,” Kerry said Tuesday at the Atlantic Council's Conference “Toward a Europe Whole and Free.”

“Clearly, not all allies are going to meet the NATO benchmark of 2 percent of GDP overnight or even next year. But it’s time for allies who are below that level to make credible commitments to increase their spending on defense over the next five years,” he said.

“This is a decade-long song related to the desire of Washington to have more adequate burden-sharing and reduce the costs of the NATO ‘security umbrella’ in the situation of tough budgetary expenditure in the United States,” Polikanov told RIA Novosti.

“While previous attempts, such as the ‘smart defense initiative’ did not prove very persuasive for Europe, the crisis in Ukraine in the immediate vicinity of the EU nations may be a much stronger argument, especially when based on Cold War stereotypes of an aggressive Russia,” he added.

At the same time Richard Weitz, Director of the Center for Political-Military Analysis at the Hudson Institute, said Kerry was justified in calling for more NATO defense spending. “Boosting this is important for non-Russian reasons, especially to enhance cyber security and missile defense,” Weitz told RIA Novosti.

He also said that in 2010 the alliance adopted a new strategic concept aimed at revitalizing the alliance and to manage new challenges. The concept intends for NATO to be “effective in a changing world, against new threats, with new capabilities and new partners” by including non-member countries and other multinational institutions, which in turn means NATO needs to address several issues related to its defense spending and capabilities

“As noted in the January 2014 NATO Defense Ministerial and the February 2014 Munich Security Conference, NATO members have only made partial progress toward realizing these ends,” Weitz said. “In particular, the ongoing defense budget cuts adopted by many members, which follow years of underfunding the military, call into question whether the Alliance can develop and sustain the capabilities needed to meet these requirements.”

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the US accounts for over 70 percent of the total defense expenditures of NATO’s 28 member countries.","MOSCOW, April 30 (RIA Novosti), Daria Chernyshova – NATO is trying to solve its own problems using the situation in Ukraine and playing up the Russian threat, Vice President of the Russian Center for Policy Studies Dmitry Polikanov told RIA Novosti.

"http://rt.com/news/155620-eu-japan-sanctions-russia/","RT","Tue- 29 Apr 2014 12-06-28 +0000","EU ?ˆ?should be ashamed?ˆ™ after sanctions on Russia - Moscow ?ˆ” RT News","EU ?ˆ?should be ashamed?ˆ™ after sanctions on Russia - Moscow ?ˆ” RT NewsEU ‘should be ashamed’ after sanctions on Russia - Moscow

The Russian Foreign Ministry responded with a scathing statement to the EU’s new round of sanctions against Russia, saying Europe apparently has no insight into the political situation in Ukraine.

“Instead of forcing the Kiev clique to sit down with
  south-eastern Ukraine to negotiate the country’s future political
  system, our partners are toeing Washington’s line to take more
  unfriendly gestures towards Russia,” the statement declared.


“If somebody in Brussels hopes to stabilize the situation in
  Ukraine by this, it is evidence of a total lack of understanding
  of the internal political situation in that country and invites
  local neo-Nazis to continue their lawlessness and thuggery
  towards the peaceful civilians of the south-east,” the
  statement said. “Are you not ashamed?”


  The reproof comes in response to EU’s unveiling a list of 15
  names targeted by the union’s new round of sanctions against
  Russia over its stance on the Ukrainian political crisis. The
  move comes a day after a similar move by Washington, although the
  American sanctions targeted fewer people and are also aimed at
  some Russian companies.



  The EU list includes Russian officials like Deputy Prime Minister
  Dmitry Kozak, Chief of General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces
  Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s new Minister for Crimean Affairs Oleg
  Savelyev and Crimea’s new Senator Olga Kovitidi.



  It also target Ukrainian leaders of the protest movement in the
  east of the country, including Igor Strelkov, a Ukrainian militia
  commander in Slavyansk, who Kiev claims is actually a Russian
  military intelligence officer named Igor Girkin. Kiev failed to
  provide any proof of the claims, and its previous US-endorsed
  evidence of alleged Russian military presence in Ukraine proved
  to be false.



  The Tuesday move brings to 48 the number of individuals targeted
  by European asset freezes and travel bans.



  Unlike Washington, Brussels didn’t level sanctions against
  businessmen like Igor Sechin, the head of Russian energy giant
  Rosneft, who is reputed to have strong ties with President
  Vladimir Putin, but does not hold any office in the Russian
  government.



  The individuals targeted by the sanctions were calm and sarcastic
  about them, as was the case with the previous rounds of
  sanctions.


“It’s such small thing that has no effect on my life or work
  that I could only say ‘stupid, but flattering’” Savelyev
  told ITAR-TASS.



  Russian Senate Speaker Valentina Matvienko, who was targeted by a
  previous round of personal sanctions, said Russia “may thank
  the West, because with their actions they are consolidating
  further the Russian society, while Russia has enough resilience
  to respond to any possible damage from such sanctions.”


  In a separate move on Tuesday Japan issued visa bans on 23
  people, expanding its own sanctions against Russia. The Russian
  Foreign Ministry called the move “clumsy” and
  “obviously taken under foreign pressure,” adding that it
  would not go without a response.



  The US and its allies are imposing more sanctions against Russian
  and Ukrainian individuals and companies in a bid to ramp up the
  cost of Moscow’s policy towards Ukraine. The West accuses Russia
  of deliberately escalating tensions in eastern Ukraine in a bid
  to undermine the authorities in Kiev, which are considered mostly
  illegitimate by Russia, but are supported by Western countries.



  Russia sees the attitude as duplicitous, considering the support
  the US and the EU gave to anti-government protest in Kiev, which
  escalated into an armed coup that brought the current leadership
  of Ukraine into power. It also says Kiev is failing to do the
  necessary steps towards defusing the situation, namely disarming
  the nationalist militias which were the cornerstone of the coup,
  and calling off the military crackdown on the protest in the
  east.","EU ‘should be ashamed’ after sanctions on Russia - Moscow

The Russian Foreign Ministry responded with a scathing statement to the EU’s new round of sanctions against Russia, saying Europe apparently has no insight into the political situation in Ukraine.

“Instead of forcing the Kiev clique to sit down with
  south-eastern Ukraine to negotiate the country’s future political
  system, our partners are toeing Washington’s line to take more
  unfriendly gestures towards Russia,” the statement declared.


“If somebody in Brussels hopes to stabilize the situation in
  Ukraine by this, it is evidence of a total lack of understanding
  of the internal political situation in that country and invites
  local neo-Nazis to continue their lawlessness and thuggery
  towards the peaceful civilians of the south-east,” the
  statement said. “Are you not ashamed?”


  The reproof comes in response to EU’s unveiling a list of 15
  names targeted by the union’s new round of sanctions against
  Russia over its stance on the Ukrainian political crisis. The
  move comes a day after a similar move by Washington, although the
  American sanctions targeted fewer people and are also aimed at
  some Russian companies.



  The EU list includes Russian officials like Deputy Prime Minister
  Dmitry Kozak, Chief of General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces
  Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s new Minister for Crimean Affairs Oleg
  Savelyev and Crimea’s new Senator Olga Kovitidi.



  It also target Ukrainian leaders of the protest movement in the
  east of the country, including Igor Strelkov, a Ukrainian militia
  commander in Slavyansk, who Kiev claims is actually a Russian
  military intelligence officer named Igor Girkin. Kiev failed to
  provide any proof of the claims, and its previous US-endorsed
  evidence of alleged Russian military presence in Ukraine proved
  to be false.



  The Tuesday move brings to 48 the number of individuals targeted
  by European asset freezes and travel bans.



  Unlike Washington, Brussels didn’t level sanctions against
  businessmen like Igor Sechin, the head of Russian energy giant
  Rosneft, who is reputed to have strong ties with President
  Vladimir Putin, but does not hold any office in the Russian
  government.



  The individuals targeted by the sanctions were calm and sarcastic
  about them, as was the case with the previous rounds of
  sanctions.


“It’s such small thing that has no effect on my life or work
  that I could only say ‘stupid, but flattering’” Savelyev
  told ITAR-TASS.



  Russian Senate Speaker Valentina Matvienko, who was targeted by a
  previous round of personal sanctions, said Russia “may thank
  the West, because with their actions they are consolidating
  further the Russian society, while Russia has enough resilience
  to respond to any possible damage from such sanctions.”


  In a separate move on Tuesday Japan issued visa bans on 23
  people, expanding its own sanctions against Russia. The Russian
  Foreign Ministry called the move “clumsy” and
  “obviously taken under foreign pressure,” adding that it
  would not go without a response.



  The US and its allies are imposing more sanctions against Russian
  and Ukrainian individuals and companies in a bid to ramp up the
  cost of Moscow’s policy towards Ukraine. The West accuses Russia
  of deliberately escalating tensions in eastern Ukraine in a bid
  to undermine the authorities in Kiev, which are considered mostly
  illegitimate by Russia, but are supported by Western countries.



  Russia sees the attitude as duplicitous, considering the support
  the US and the EU gave to anti-government protest in Kiev, which
  escalated into an armed coup that brought the current leadership
  of Ukraine into power. It also says Kiev is failing to do the
  necessary steps towards defusing the situation, namely disarming
  the nationalist militias which were the cornerstone of the coup,
  and calling off the military crackdown on the protest in the
  east.",689

May Day celebrations in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, have turned violent as pro-autonomy activists seized the local Prosecutor’s Office. Police responded with tear gas and stun grenades but later relinquished their weapons.


  The storming of the Donetsk Region Prosecutor’s Office began as
  several dozen shield-holding protesters pelted rocks and petrol
  bombs at the building while chanting “Fascists!,” as
  they tried to break in.



  Twenty-six people sustained injuries, including gunshot wounds,
  as a result of the storm and clashes, RIA Novosti reported,
  citing Donetsk officials. Two of them have been hospitalized. The
  Interior Ministry said that one National Guard soldier was
  wounded.

  The activists demanded that law enforcers come out of the
  building and surrender, while about 200 police remained inside.
  Initially, the police hit back with tear gas and stun grenades,
  but later refrained from using force and took cover under shields
  as protesters continued to throw stones.



  “Some security forces are laying down their shields, letting
  activists take them,” RT’s correspondent in Ukraine, Paula

  Eventually, the activists entered the building as the police
  left, removed the Ukrainian national flag, burned it and replaced
  it with the flag of the self-proclaimed People’s Republic of
  Donetsk.



  The protesters formed a so-called “shame corridor” to
  let law enforcers out of the building, according to
  Interfax-Ukraine.



  After the police were defeated, the crowd cheered the victors
  with a “well done!” chant and held a demonstration in front of

  May Day celebrations in Donetsk, one of the largest cities in
  crisis-torn Ukraine, began peacefully, with up to 300 communists
  marching through the city on Thursday morning. Waving hammer and
  sickle flags, they chanted: “Fascism will not pass,” and
  sang Soviet songs.



  Later in the day, the communist march was followed by several
  thousands of anti-government protesters taking to the streets to
  demand a referendum on more autonomy from Kiev and a release of
  anti-government protesters.



  Activists staged a rally in the city center calling for a boycott
  on the upcoming presidential elections. They also demanded
  freedom for the “people’s governor” of Donetsk”, Pavel Gubarev, who has been under arrest in
  Kiev since early March.



  Thousands demonstrate for autonomy in eastern Ukraine on May Day



  May Day, also known as International Worker's Day, was marked by
  demonstrations in cities across southeastern Ukraine on Thursday.



  In Odessa, a port city on the Black Sea, about 2,000 activists –
  including supporters of the federalization of Ukraine and
  leftists – held a march to mark the holiday, which used to be one
  of the most important days during the Soviet era.



  Activists from the People’s Alternative movement set up a tent
  camp in the city center to collect signatures in support of a
  referendum that would give regions more autonomy and grant the
  Russian language status of the second official language in
  Ukraine, Itar-Tass reported.



  Protesters vowed to stay at the site until authorities fulfilled
  their demands regarding a popular vote and released all
  protesters arrested by Ukrainian security services.



  “We want to build a bright future and take all the best we
  had in the past. The people who come to our rallies have an
  ideology unlike those who have likened ideas to the contents of
  their refrigerators,” Oleg Muzyka, one of the leaders of the
  Rodina (Fatherland) party, said.



  Local media reported that several radical protesters called on
  demonstrators to storm the Odessa administration building, but
  were ousted from the crowd.



  In Kharkov – Ukraine’s second largest city – a May Day
  demonstration was held next to the monument to Lenin, the
  Bolshevik Revolution leader. Just like in neighboring regions,
  traditional Soviet slogans were accompanied by anti-government
  chants as communists were joined by autonomy supporters. Later, a
  group of activists waving flags of the so-called People’s
  Republic of Kharkov split from the main event and moved on to the
  city administration building, which was being heavily guarded by
  law enforcement. No major incidents were reported.","Tear gas in Ukraine’s Donetsk as activists seize Prosecutor’s Office (PHOTOS)

In a signal Washington would keep pressure on Iran over its nuclear program, the U.S. State Department also offered up to $5 million for information leading to businessman Li Fangwei's arrest or conviction.

Federal prosecutors also seized $6.9 million in funds that had been traced to Li.

China resolutely opposes the United States citing domestic law to unilaterally impose sanctions on Chinese companies or individuals. We believe that what the United States has done will not help resolve the issue and will harm bilateral cooperation on counter proliferation, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said.

China pays great attention to anti-proliferation export controls and will seriously deal with any violations of its laws, Qin told reporters at a regular press briefing.

China urges the United States to stop these wrong acts of putting sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals and return to the correct path of anti-proliferation cooperation, Qin said.

Li has been the target of U.S. sanctions in the past for his alleged role as a supplier to Iran's ballistic missile program.

In 2009, he was charged with selling restricted materials to Iran by the Manhattan District Attorney and Treasury banned him and his company, LIMMT, from conducting business in the United States without a license or authorization.

The latest actions further limit Li's ability to conduct business worldwide.

Contacted by Reuters on Feb 4, 2013, for an earlier story about his business, Li said he continued to get commercial inquiries from Iran but only for legitimate merchandise. Li said his metals company, LIMMT, had stopped selling to Iran once the United States began sanctioning the firm several years ago.

Reuters has been unable to contact him since.

Calls to multiple telephone numbers of LIMMT, based in the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, either went unanswered, or the person answering hung up when asked for Li.

Described as a known proliferator and a principal supplier to Iran's ballistic missile program, Li has also been accused of trying to buy materials from the United States, China and other countries that could be used by Iran to produce or deliver weapons of mass destruction.

Iran and a group of world powers reached a temporary agreement in November under which Tehran would get about $7 billion in sanctions relief in return for steps to restrain its nuclear activities.

In March, a U.S. official said Iran had pursued buying banned components for its nuclear and missile programs, even while it was striking the interim deal to limit its disputed nuclear program.

Vann Van Diepen, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for international security and non-proliferation, said Li had continued to supply such items despite U.S. pressure on China to tighten export controls.

Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia has hit $3.5 billion, according to preliminary data released on Wednesday, a Gazprom official told reporters.


  The new data includes Ukraine’s Naftogaz order as of April 30 and
  those volumes that were already supplied this month, Sergey
  Kupriyanov stated.



  Ukraine's energy minister, Yury Prodan, responded, stating that
  Ukraine does now agree with Russia’s gas debt estimate of US$3.5
  billion, UNN news agency reported. Prodan added that Ukraine
  continues to insist on the price of $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters
  for Russian gas.



  Last week, Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said that
  Ukraine’s growing gas debt may lead to the failure of the
  country’s transit obligations and the reduction of gas
  supplies to southeastern Europe.



  The debt may force a situation where not enough gas will be
  pumped into Ukrainian underground storage facilities, which may
  create the risk of non-performance by Ukraine of its transit
  obligations and of an undersupply of gas to southeastern Europe,
  the minister stated.



  In December, Russia provided Ukraine with a $3 billion loan,
  which was part of a larger $15 billion aid package agreed the
  same month. Moscow also offered a 33 percent gas price discount
  that would have saved more than $7.5 billion.



  In April, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that Russia
  cannot continue to prop up Ukraine’s faltering economy.


“The Russian Federation doesn’t recognize the legitimacy of
  the authorities in Kiev, but it keeps providing economic support
  and subsidizing the economy of Ukraine with hundreds of millions
  and billions of dollars. This situation can’t last
  indefinitely,” Putin said.

Kerry, emerging from talks about the increasingly ethnic slaughter in South Sudan with foreign ministers from neighboring Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya, said all sides agreed the killing must stop.

A legitimate force that has an ability to help make peace needs to get on the ground as rapidly as possible, Kerry said in Addis Ababa at the start of an African trip.

Addressing reporters later, Kerry said the goal was in these next days, literally, we can move more rapidly to put people on the ground who could begin to make a difference.

His Ethiopian counterpart, Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom, said all sides stressed the need for deployment of a force as soon as possible.

A spokeswoman said Kerry was referring to regional forces under the authority of the United Nations, which already has a mission in South Sudan. Kerry said he and his African counterparts agreed on the terms and timing and manner and size of such a force but declined to offer details.

The greatest single difference will be moving rapidly with U.N. Security Council imprimatur of support to get forces on the ground who could begin to separate people and provide safety and security. That's imperative, Kerry told reporters.

More than 1 million people have fled their homes and thousands of people have been killed since fighting erupted in December between troops backing President Salva Kiir and soldiers loyal to his sacked deputy, Riek Machar.

The fighting has exacerbated ethnic tensions between Kiir's Dinka people and Machar's Nuer.

Negotiations between the Kiir government and rebels loyal to Machar have failed to advance since the January 23 signing of a ceasefire that never took hold.

TROUBLING QUESTIONS

Asked about the risk of genocide, Kerry said very disturbing, leading indicators of the kind of ethnic, tribal, targeted nationalistic killings raised troubling questions.

Were they to continue in the way that they have been going (they) could really present a very serious challenge to the international community with respect to the question of genocide, he told reporters.

Delegations from both sides in South Sudan resumed face-to-face discussions in Addis Ababa on Thursday after several delays, officials said.

A senior State Department official, speaking to reporters traveling with Kerry ahead of the trip, said regional powers were losing patience with the inability of both sides in South Sudan to move forward with peace efforts.

I think both sides think that they can win this militarily, and they have certainly not participated in any committed way to finding a negotiated settlement for the conflict, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Kerry also renewed U.S. threats of sanctions and said regional partners Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia also accepted the responsibility for also doing sanctions.

U.S. lawmakers are also pushing the Obama administration to do more. A group of nine Democratic and Republican senators wrote to President Barack Obama on Thursday, urging him to impose sanctions on those responsible for human rights abuses, work to strengthen the mandate of the U.N. South Sudan mission and hold Kiir and Machar accountable for progress in peace negotiations.

Many South Sudanese own property in the three neighboring countries and regularly travel there, the State Department official said.

Obama earlier this month authorized possible targeted sanctions against those committing human rights abuses in South Sudan or undermining democracy and obstructing the peace process.

Still, Kerry held out hope that talks might sway the course of events in South Sudan and pointed to Kiir's decision last week to release four political prisoners.

We are hoping that now opens up the possibility of a mediation and dialogue that could take place anywhere in the next few days, he said.

A massive fight broke out on Kiev’s landmark Independence Square (Maidan) on Tuesday night, with shots and explosives being heard, according to Ukrainian media. There are reports of injuries.


  Eye witnesses described over 100 people, reportedly members of
  the far-right Social-National Assembly, marching with burning

  that removed former President Yanukovich from power. The marchers
  came to commemorate those killed during anti-government protests
  in December-February.

  across from the main post office, prompting a massive fight.



  The far-right radicals reportedly used firecrackers, traumatic
  guns, and tear gas. Many of them carried bats and sticks. There
  are reports of injuries, according to Ukrainian media.



  One of the tents at Maidan caught fire, and the blazes were
  swiftly extinguished. Witnesses reported ambulances arriving at

He noted that Ukraine had said nothing about when it was going to pay for Russian gas. “Our Ukrainian colleagues did not say anything about when they would pay for the gas the already received and they will receive later,” he said. “Our Ukrainian colleagues didn’t tell us what sum from this loan would be used to repay the debts to remedy the crisis situation,” he noted, adding that he thought that Ukraine should use some part of this money to repay its current debts and to pay for gas supplies.

We will not have a choice but to move forward with additional, more severe sanctions, if Russia disrupts Ukraine's presidential elections scheduled on May 25, Obama said at a joint news conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.

We are confident that we will have a package that will further impact Russia's growth and economy, Obama said, adding that the sanctions could target Russia's energy, arms and finance sectors.

Merkel said the European Union is prepared to slap a new round of sanctions on Russia with a broad range of possibilities, stressing that sanctions on Russia show that we are serious about our principles.

The two leaders met in Washington as Kiev launched a major offensive against militants that have seized government buildings across Ukraine's east. Russia slammed the operation, saying it would wipe out all hope for the viability of an agreement reached in Geneva last month.

While showing determination to impose more costs on Russia should it further destabilizes Ukraine, both leaders expressed the hope that the crisis in Ukraine will be resolved through diplomatic means.

Our preference is a diplomatic resolution to this issue, Obama said, adding our hope is that we do not have to deploy the sanctions.

Obama added that the sanctions are not aimed at punishing the Russian people, but dissuading Russian President Vladimir Putin from his current course. Merkel said she agreed with Obama that sanctions are not an end in itself.

Both the U.S. and the European Union announced fresh sanctions on more Russian officials and firms Monday, in a display of unity amid the worsening situation in Ukraine. But some European officials have expressed misgivings that the sanctions on Russia could backfire given Europe's dependence on Russia for energy.

At Friday's press conference, Obama also called on Russia to help free observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Ukraine. He said pro-Russia militants are still holding seven observers, including four Germans.

Russia needs to work to secure their immediate release, said Obama, adding that the U.S. and Germany are united in expressing outrage over the appalling treatment of the OSCE observers.

Full story","WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that the U.S. and Germany are prepared to impose broader sanctions on Russia if it continues to destabilize Ukraine.

We will not have a choice but to move forward with additional, more severe sanctions, if Russia disrupts Ukraine's presidential elections scheduled on May 25, Obama said at a joint news conference with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.

We are confident that we will have a package that will further impact Russia's growth and economy, Obama said, adding that the sanctions could target Russia's energy, arms and finance sectors.

Merkel said the European Union is prepared to slap a new round of sanctions on Russia with a broad range of possibilities, stressing that sanctions on Russia show that we are serious about our principles.

The two leaders met in Washington as Kiev launched a major offensive against militants that have seized government buildings across Ukraine's east. Russia slammed the operation, saying it would wipe out all hope for the viability of an agreement reached in Geneva last month.

While showing determination to impose more costs on Russia should it further destabilizes Ukraine, both leaders expressed the hope that the crisis in Ukraine will be resolved through diplomatic means.

Our preference is a diplomatic resolution to this issue, Obama said, adding our hope is that we do not have to deploy the sanctions.

Obama added that the sanctions are not aimed at punishing the Russian people, but dissuading Russian President Vladimir Putin from his current course. Merkel said she agreed with Obama that sanctions are not an end in itself.

Both the U.S. and the European Union announced fresh sanctions on more Russian officials and firms Monday, in a display of unity amid the worsening situation in Ukraine. But some European officials have expressed misgivings that the sanctions on Russia could backfire given Europe's dependence on Russia for energy.

At Friday's press conference, Obama also called on Russia to help free observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Ukraine. He said pro-Russia militants are still holding seven observers, including four Germans.

Russia needs to work to secure their immediate release, said Obama, adding that the U.S. and Germany are united in expressing outrage over the appalling treatment of the OSCE observers.

Naftogaz of Ukraine had imported 2.250 billion cubic metres of gas worth $1.09 billion by April 26. The request for import in the remaining days of April is 110 million cubic meters per day. The overall amount of gas to be imported by Ukraine in April will be 2.7 billion cubic metres. With the price of $ 485.5 per 1,000 cubic metres, Ukraine’s debt will increase by $ 1.3 billion by May 1 to reach $ 3.5 billion.

 

Aid from the EU

The agreement on reverse-flow gas supplies assigned with Slovakia will not allow Ukraine to meet its needs without Russian gas. Ukraine consumes 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually and produces 20 billion cubic metres (including Crimea). Reverse-flow supplies will amount to 3.2 billion cubic metres from Slovakia and to 1.5 billion cubic metres from Poland. Hungary may supply 5 billion cubic metres. This will allow Ukraine to make up for one-third of imports from Russia.

Gas price

Ukraine is ready to pay its debt to Russia’s Gazprom for gas supplies at a price of $268.5 per 1,000 cubic metres, Prodan said.

“Ukraine is ready to pay the debt. But we cannot pay the price Gazprom set from April 1. It is unjustifiably high and is about $500. We are ready to pay under our obligations,” the minister said.

According to Prodan, reverse-flow supplies can reach 8 billion cubic metres by September 1, 2014, not by 2015. Gas will be supplied by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline, not the transit pipeline.

EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said such supplies would not require the Russian company’s agreement and would give Ukraine up to 10 billion cubic metres of a gas a year but stressed that reverse-flow gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine by the trunk pipeline would be impossible without Gazprom’s consent as it would run counter to the Slovak company Eustream’s contractual obligations.

Oettinger believes that diversification of supplies will help to solve Ukraine’s gas problem in part. However reverse-flow supplies from Poland and Hungary by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline will not be enough for Ukraine get through the coming winter comfortably.

He also said that the European Union was providing support to Kiev on the repayment of its gas debt to Russia.

The throughput capacity of the Ukrainian gas transportation is 288 billion cubic metres system at the entrance and 178.5 billion cubic meters at the exit, including 142.5 billion cubic metres to European countries and 3.5 billion cubic metres to Moldova. Natural gas transit through Ukraine to Europe and CIS countries in 2011 increased by 5.7% from 2010 to 104,197,067,000 cubic metres, including to Western Europe by 5.9% to 101,098,013,000 cubic metres, but decreased by 2.4% to 3,099,054,000 cubic metres to CIS countries.

Ukraine’s gas transportation system consists of 72 compressor stations, 110 production shops and 1,451 gas distribution stations. The overall length of gas pipelines operated by the company is 38,600 kilometres, including 22,200 kilometres of trunk pipelines and 16,400 kilometres of extensions.","“Ukraine’s overall debt for Russian gas, according to preliminary estimates, will be $3.492 billion, ñonsidering Naftogaz of Ukraine’s request for April 30 and the volumes we have already delivered this month, ” he said.

In a telephone conversation on Saturday, April 26, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that 92% of chemical material had been removed from Syria up to date.

The Joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has confirmed delivery of a further shipment of chemical weapons material, which has brought the total of chemical material removed and destroyed in country to 92.5%

“I welcome the significant progress of the last three weeks, and I strongly encourage the Syrian authorities to conclude the removal operations as part of their efforts to achieve the 30 June 2014 deadline. Particular thanks goes to Member States for their steadfast support,” U.N./OPCW Joint Mission Special Coordinator Sigrid Kaag.

In addition to the removal operations, the Syrian authorities have destroyed buildings, equipment and empty mustard gas containers, and decontaminated other containers in a number of chemical weapons storage and production sites. A majority of these sites are now closed.

Kaag said on April 22 that the removal of chemicals from Syria would be completed within the next few days. This will contribute to meeting the deadlines set by the OPCW Executive Council, including the June 30, 2014 target date for completing the destruction of Syria’s entire chemical weapons programme.

“The renewed pace in movements is positive and necessary to ensure progress towards a tight deadline,” she said.

According to the OPCW, no chemical weapons will be left in Syria by April 27. They will be destroyed by Britain, Germany, the United States, and Finland.

When all of the Syrian chemicals from all storage sites have been loaded aboard the Danish and Norwegian cargo ships, they will be transported to various locations for destruction under the verification of OPCW inspectors.

The majority of Priority 1 chemicals will be neutralised at sea aboard the U.S. vessel MV Cape Ray, while a smaller amount will be neutralised at a land-based facility in Ellesmere Port, UK. The Priority 2 chemicals will be destroyed at commercial facilities in the U.S. and Finland. A facility in Germany will dispose of part of the effluent from the Cape Ray operations, the OPCW said.

The Syrian Government informed the Joint Mission of a revised plan for removing all relevant chemicals from its territory by April 27. The amended plan was considered by the OPCW Executive Council in The Hague in early March 7. Western countries were concerned that the delays would not allow Syria to destroy all of its chemical weapons by June 30, 2014 as was initially planned and it will need a delay of several months.

The removal of the most critical material for destruction began on January 7, 2014, a week after the deadline for its completion set by an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States under which Syria renounced its chemical weapons material and joined 1992 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons.

On November 15, 2013, the OPCW Executive Council (EC) approved a detailed plan of destruction to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile. In the plan, Syrian chemical weapons will be transported for destruction outside its territory to ensure their destruction in the “safest and soonest manner”, and no later than June 30, 2014.

Under Security Council Resolution 2118 (2013) and decisions of the OPCW Executive Council, Syria’s entire chemical weapons programme is to be destroyed by June 30, 2014.

The Ukrainian interior ministry said on Thursday that the pro-Russian rebels were killed as paratroopers took over three illegal checkpoints around the town, which has been in separatist control for almost two weeks.

Videos posted online showed smoke rising from barricades around the town. Reports said that rebels had set fire to the barricades as they abandoned them and retreated from Ukranian forces.

The Reuters news agency reported that Ukrainian troops had set up new positions around the town. The AFP agency said that Ukrainian forces had told pro-Russian rebels to leave government buildings they were occupying, although this was not confirmed by any other source.

The operation prompted Russia to order new military exercises in regions bordering Ukraine.

NATO has estimated its deployment at 40,000 troops.

We are compelled to react to such a situation, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian news agencies.

From today, military exercises have started in regions bordering Ukraine involving battalions of tactical forces of the southern and western military districts.

President Vladimir Putin had warned earlier on Thursday that there would be consequences if the Ukraine army was used against pro-Russian activists.

If Kiev really began to use the army against the country's population... that is a very serious crime against its own people, he said.

The operation came hours after the government reported that its forces had taken control of the town hall in the city of Mariupol, and repelled an attack on an army base in the eastern town of Artemivsk, the ministries said.

Separatist sources also reported the loss of the town hall in Mariupol. The city was the scene of a rebel attack on troops last week that left three rebels dead. The separatists had held the town hall since April 13.

The town hall is liberated and can function normally, Arsen Avakov, Ukraine's interior minister, said on his Facebook page.

The Defence Ministry said in a statement that Ukranian forces repelled nearly 100 separatists in an attack on the military base in Artemivsk, just north of rebel-held Donetsk.

The attackers were repelled and suffered significant losses, Oleksandr Turchynov, Ukraine's acting president, said.

US President Barack Obama said on Thursday that Russia had failed to abide by the spirit of a deal to ease tensions in Ukraine, and that new sanctions against Russia were being teed up.

He said malicious armed men continued to occupy buildings in eastern Ukraine, in contradiction to a deal agreed last week in Geneva by Ukraine, Russia, the EU and the US.

So far we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva, Obama said.

 If that continued, he said, there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions.

On Wednesday Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, warned that Russia would respond if its interests were threatened, and made reference to Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008 after Georgian forces attacked separatists in its pro-Moscow region of South Ossetia.

Germany’s Chancellor Merkel is in the White House for the first time since it was revealed the NSA monitored her personal communications. During bilateral talks with Barack Obama, Merkel is expected to broach sanctions on Russia and US spying.


  Relations between Washington and Berlin are showing signs of
  tensions, as German companies call for a halt to sanctions on
  Russia. Furthermore, Germany is still reeling from the NSA spy
  revelations that affected millions of German citizens, as well as
  high-ranking businessmen and politicians.



  Merkel reiterated earlier this week that Germany would support
  any further financial sanctions against Russia. However, growing
  calls from the German business sector may force her to change her
  policy in Friday’s meeting.


“The Germans are very clear they are not going to pursue
  factions that hurt German industry. That would be the straw that
  broke the camel’s back,” said Michael Hudson professor of
  Economics at the University of Missouri to RT.



  Indeed, some major corporate figures have already spoken out
  against a potential escalation of the sanctions, maintaining they
  will do more harm than good to the German economy.


“If there's a single message we have as business leaders,
  then it's this: sit down at the negotiating table and resolve
  these matters peacefully,” Eckhard Cordes told a recent
  conference in Berlin. Cordes is a former Daimler AG executive who
  now heads the Ostauschuss, German industry's branch for Eastern
  Europe, reported the Wall Street Journal.



  So far the US, EU, Canada and Japan have imposed sanction on
  Russia for its alleged role in the unrest in eastern Ukraine.
  Moscow has denied claims it is involved in the unrest and has
  pointed the finger at Washington for orchestrating the situation
  in Ukraine as part of its geopolitical strategy in the region.



  NSA spying



  The espionage antics of the US National Security Agency remain a
  bone of contention between Berlin and Washington. It emerged
  earlier in April that Merkel had been denied access to her NSA
  file, following reports the agency had monitored her personal
  communications. The revelations had a profound effect on German
  society, prompting calls for Washington to account for its
  actions.


“First the US denied spying on Merkel’s cell phone, then
  admitted it, now it just continues, because Obama says ‘we
  reserve the right to collect information.’ I just see Angela
  Merkel going to the US to pick up new instructions,” Ken
  Jebson, Redaktion radio host told RT’s Peter Oliver.



  While WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafsson, said the German
  government’s lack of resolve over the NSA spy scandal is
  indicative of European cowardice in the face of US dominance.


“I think the proof of the cowardice of governments and
  politicians and their unwillingness to tackle this in a
  meaningful way, despite what they say publicly, was when European
  countries closed their airspace and forced the presidential plane
  of Evo Morales to land in Austria, on a hunch that Edward Snowden
  was on board,” he told RT.



  Earlier this year Washington pledged that it would no longer spy
  on world leaders, but stated it would still gather information on
  the intentions of foreign powers through its espionage programs.","Russian sanctions, NSA spying top the agenda at Merkel’s White House visit

Dobkin also called upon the opposition and the Kiev authorities to pass a memorandum on mutual understanding as soon as possible.

?Russia is experiencing recession, and the 2014 growth forecast has been cut to 0.2 percent from 1.3 percent, the International Monetary Fund mission chief to Moscow said on Wednesday.


  Ukraine and Western-led sanctions are partly to blame, as
  political tension has dragged down the economic forecast for
  Russia, which at the beginning of the year, the IMF estimated
  could reach 3 percent.



  However, Russia was already experiencing recession, IMF mission
  chief Antonio Spilimbergo told reporters Wednesday.


If you understand by recession two quarters of negative
  economic growth then Russia is experiencing recession now,
  Spilimbergo told reporters Wednesday, citing last year’s weak
  growth of 2013 as evidence.



  Sanctions are hurting the Russian economy, the IMF said. This
  week both the US
  and the EU
  rolled out new sanctions against Moscow for a perceived ‘failure’
  of peacekeeping in eastern Ukraine. Moscow maintains Kiev has
  done next to nothing
  to de-escalate the conflict.


Turmoil in Ukraine has caused instability in
  Russian stock markets, and has made investors uneasy about the
  region.



  Capital outflows are a major concern, and the IMF estimates that
  in 2014, more than $100 billion will leave Russia.



  The Russian government has estimated capital outflow in 2014
  could reach between $70-80 billion. In the first 3 months of
  2014, $50.6 billion trickled out of the Russian economy.


The difficult situation and especially the uncertainty
  surrounding the geopolitical situation and follow up of sanctions
  and escalation of sanctions are weighing very negatively on the
  investment climate, Spilimbergo said.



  However, high oil prices continue to have a stabilizing effect on
  the domestic economy and state finances. Oil and gas export
  revenues account for more than half of the Russian budget.



  The Washington-based IMF said that in order for Russia to offset
  the impact of the geopolitical tension in Ukraine, the country
  must ensure macroeconomic stability.



  The ruble has lost more than 9 percent against the dollar since
  the beginning of 2014. Last week Russia’s Central Bank
  unexpectedly raised its key interest rate in order to combat
  inflation. The IMF chief forecast that consumer prices would rise
  6 percent in 2014.



  Part of the reasons the ruble has fallen so ‘dramatically’ is
  because of the Central Bank’s decision to normalize the
  overvalued currency, which it wants to be free-floating by 2015,
  a goal the IMF supports.



  Standard & Poor has cut Russia's rating to the lowest investment
  grade, which Moscow says is ‘politically motivated’ and a reason
  for the country to establish its own ratings system.



  Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia faces ‘unprecedented’ economic challenges, but that
  sanctions will make Russia stronger.



  Russian government officials believe the best case scenario for
  2014 is zero growth.



  The Ukraine crisis has pushed Russia to seek more cooperation
  with China and Asian neighbors, as well as to boost demand for
  domestic products.","‘Russia in recession’ – IMF

United States President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that the US and European Union are ready to impose broad sectoral sanctions on Russia if upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine are disrupted.


  Should Ukrainian presidential elections scheduled for May 25 be
  impeded by Russia, Pres. Obama said, then sectoral sanctions
  against Moscow would be “inevitable.”



  Germany, Merkel added, is “ready and prepared to impose
  sectoral sanctions on Russia in the event that Moscow refuses to
  help deescalate matters along its border with Ukraine. Both Pres.
  Obama and Chancellor Merkel told reporters from the White House
  Rose Garden that while a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian
  crisis is preferred, further steps with regards to sectoral
  measures in the context of certain branches of industry could
  soon be announced.



  The people of Ukraine are expected in three weeks to vote for a
  new president following the ousting earlier this year of former
  leader Viktor Yanukovych. But as tensions worsen near Ukraine's
  border with Russia to the east and south, both German and
  American leadership now say that further escalations on the part
  of Moscow would warrant broader sanctions being introduced.



  Meanwhile, Russia's envoy to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin,
  told the UN Security Council on Friday that the US and its
  western allies have all but eliminated the possibility of a
  peaceful solution to the Ukrainian ordeal.



  It is the interim government in Kiev, Churkin said, that hasn't
  adhered to last month's Geneva agreement, and is apparently being
  backed with the support of the west despite urging from the US
  and EU for a full-on deescalation.



  “Supporting the organizers of the Kiev government coup and
  their military crackdown on protesters, the US and EU take great
  responsibility practically cutting all paths to resolve the
  crisis peacefully,” Churkin said early Friday.



  Any new sanctions, Obama said, would “further impact Russia's
  growth and economy” and be aimed at any of several sectors.
  At the same time, however, he said his administration hopes
  imposing further costs on Moscow won't be required.



  During the last weeks, Obama said, both the US and EU have
  “offered a diplomatic approach that could resolve this
  issue,” while supporting the Ukrainian government in Kiev
  “economically, diplomatically and politically.”

“We said that we would apply costs and consequences to the
  Russians if they continued with their actions,” Obama
  continued, “and that is exactly what we've done.”


  Now with Merkel by his side, Obama said further sanctions could
  soon be on the way.


“There are a range of approaches that can be taken not only
  in the energy sector, but in the arms sector, the finance sector,
  in terms of lines of credit for trade, all that have a
  significant impact on Russia,” Obama said.


“We anticipate that if we have to use them, then we
  can,” he added, to which the German official agreed.


There is a broad range of possibilities that are being
  prepared for in the European Union, she said.


“This is not necessarily what we want, but we are ready and
  prepared,” Merkel added with regards to a third-wave of
  sanctions.



  Reiterating comments made earlier this week by US Secretary of
  State John Kerry, Pres. Obama said that the interim government in
  Kiev, unlike Russia, has followed through with commitments
  pledged recently during an agreement reached in Geneva,
  Switzerland recently by representatives for the US, EU, Ukraine
  and Russia .


“We need Russians to do the same,” Obama urged.



  At the same time, however, the commander-in-chief acknowledged
  that, should Moscow fail to act, then perhaps the harshest
  imaginable of sanctions — ones waged at Russia's energy sector —
  would be impossible to fully implement.



  Although the US has already sanctioned a number of leading
  Russian figures reportedly close to Pres. Vladimir Putin and
  several sectors, concerns have been raised about refusing to let
  Moscow sell energy reserves to neighboring nations in the EU.
  Even during the height of hostilities during the
  twentieth-century, Obama said, that relationship continued.


“Energy flows from Russia to Europe,” he said,
  “--those continued even in the midst of the Cold War.”


  Merkel admitted during Friday's presser than roughly half a dozen
  EU nations rely 100 percent on Russia for energy, but that that
  could change during the next decade if Russia fails to adhere to
  requests from the West to deescalate matters in Ukraine.


“The idea that you're going to turn off the tap on all
  Russian oil or natural gas exports, I think, is
  unrealistic,” Obama added, but not before acknowledging that
  the US and EU are ready to announce other sectoral sanctions if
  this month's elections are disrupted.

  Ukrainian crisis and other matters, including the National
  Security Agency's intelligence gathering methods, Friday at the

Kiev has all but lost control of its police forces in parts of eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian activists have seized buildings in the region's second biggest city of Donetsk and several smaller towns.

The regional leadership does not control its police force,  Stanislav Rechynsky, an aide to Arsen Avakov, the interior minister, told Reuters news agency on Tuesday. The local police did nothing.

Rechynsky said the ministry had information that they would next try to take the local television centre.

Video footage showed men, some dressed in green camouflage fatigues and holding shields, walking around what appeared to be the foyer of the government headquarters as hundreds massed outside the building's large wooden doors.

Pro-Russian separatists had previously occupied only the local security services' building in Luhansk, which they took in early April.

Sanctions against Moscow

Earlier on Tuesday, Russia's foreign ministry said the European Union should be ashamed for doing Washington's bidding by punishing Moscow with sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.

The ministry's comment came hours after the EU imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 15 more names of Russian and pro-Moscow Ukrainian officials, including Russia's deputy prime minister, deputy chairman of state Duma and chief of staff of armed forces.

Instead of forcing the Kiev clique to sit at the table with southeastern Ukraine to negotiate the future structure of the country, our partners are doing Washington's bidding with new unfriendly gestures aimed at Russia, the foreign ministry said.

If this is how someone in Brussels hopes to stabilise the situation in Ukraine, it is obvious evidence of a complete lack of understanding of the internal political situation ... and a direct invitation for the local neo-Nazis to continue to conduct lawlessness and reprisals against the peaceful population of the southeast, it said in a statement. Are they not ashamed?

Grigory Karasin, the deputy foreign minister, said separately that the United States and EU sanctions were an absolutely counterproductive, trite measure that would force the already critical situation in Ukraine into a dead end, the state-run RIA news agency reported.

Russia has not yet announced any steps in response to the new sanctions.

Pro-Russians react

Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the de facto mayor of a separatist-held town Slovyansk, said on Tuesday that he would discuss the release of detained military observers with the West only if the EU dropped sanctions against rebel leaders.

The six observers were in Ukraine under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a democracy watchdog. They were detained last week after separatists said they had found a Ukrainian spy with them.

Meanwhile, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, told the Wall Street Journal late on Monday that the Ukraine crisis was centred on the motivations of Russia's president, Vladimir Putin.

You almost feel that he's creating his own reality, and his own sort of world, divorced from a lot of what's real on the ground for all those people, including people in his own country, Kerry said, just hours after the US administration announced another round of economic sanctions on Russian individuals and companies.

The crisis is an amazing display of a kind of personal reaction to something that just doesn't fit into the lessons learned for the last 60 years or 70 years... It's unfortunate for the Russian people, clearly don't fit into the costs that are being attached to this, it appears to be so personal to President Putin.

Instead of forcing the Kiev clique to sit at the table with southeastern Ukraine to negotiate the future structure of the country, our partners are doing Washington's bidding with new unfriendly gestures aimed at Russia, the foreign ministry said.

If this is how someone in Brussels hopes to stabilise the situation in Ukraine, it is obvious evidence of a complete lack of understanding of the internal political situation ... and a direct invitation for the local neo-Nazis to continue to conduct lawlessness and reprisals against the peaceful population of the southeast, it said in a statement. Are they not ashamed?

Grigory Karasin, the deputy foreign minister, said separately that the United States and EU sanctions were an absolutely counterproductive, trite measure that would force the already critical situation in Ukraine into a dead end, the state-run RIA news agency reported.

Russia has not yet announced any steps in response to the new sanctions.

Pro-Russians react

Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the de facto mayor of a separatist-held town Slovyansk, said on Tuesday that he would discuss the release of detained military observers with the West only if the EU dropped sanctions against rebel leaders.

The six observers were in Ukraine under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a democracy watchdog. They were detained last week after separatists said they had found a Ukrainian spy with them.

Meanwhile, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, told the Wall Street Journal late on Monday that the Ukraine crisis was centred on the motivations of Russia's president, Vladimir Putin.

You almost feel that he's creating his own reality, and his own sort of world, divorced from a lot of what's real on the ground for all those people, including people in his own country, Kerry said, just hours after the US administration announced another round of economic sanctions on Russian individuals and companies.

The crisis is an amazing display of a kind of personal reaction to something that just doesn't fit into the lessons learned for the last 60 years or 70 years... It's unfortunate for the Russian people, clearly don't fit into the costs that are being attached to this, it appears to be so personal to President Putin.

Speaking on possible retaliatory measures towards the ongoing joint exercises by South Korea and the United States in the region, the ambassador said the situation for North Korea was rather tense.

“It is notable that America is located several thousand kilometers from this country across the ocean. They have come to us, to the Korean Peninsula, they conduct military maneuvers in every convenient case each year. When our Army conducts its regular military drills they call it a provocation and a threat against South Korea,” Jae said.

The ambassador said North Korea urges Washington not to conduct any military drills near the republic’s borders which “indeed pose a serious military threat, the threat of a nuclear war.”

“If they want, let them carry out [drills] near their coasts, and take all the nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula with them,” he said.

According to Jae, the Americans do not conceal that military drills are aimed directly at “toppling our system.” During the recent military drills, “an amphibious operation imitating the seizure of Pyongyang” was conducted, he said.

“We also have our own ‘red line’ and let them not cross this line. Some countries demand that we keep calm and remain patient, but such a demand should be made to Americans so that they do not provoke us,” the diplomat said.

Earlier this month, North Korea accused Washington of heightening tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang said it was drawing a red line, warning Washington not to cross it in its bid for regime change in the country.

The White House on Monday said the third round of sanctions in response to the Ukraine crisis was prompted by Moscow's failure to adhere to an April 17 agreement in Geneva on ways to resolve the situation.

Officials made clear that sanctions against key sections of Russia's economy will be imposed, including the energy and defence sections, should Russia send troops massed along the Ukraine border into eastern Ukraine.

The seven Russians sanctioned include two Putin allies: Igor Sechin, head of Russia's major oil company Rosneft, and Sergei Chemezov, head of Rostec, a Russian state-owned high-tech products company.

The 17 companies will be subject to an asset freeze.

Russia's Volga Group, one of the targeted companies, said on Monday that Washington's measures were politically motivated statements and decisions.

The other people named on Monday were Oleg Belavencev, who is Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea, Dmitry Kozak, deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, Evgeniy Murov, director of Russia's federal protective service and an army general, Aleksei Pushkov, a state Duma deputy, and Vyacheslav Volodin, a Putin adviser.

The White House said that Washington would also deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities.

EU action

The US decision coincided with a preliminary agreement reached by European leaders to impose asset freezes and visa bans on 15 more people.

The names of those to be added to the list will not be made public until they are published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday.

The US has been much more aggressive in the penalties it has imposed on Russia than has the 28-nation European Union, which depends heavily on Russia for energy.

The EU has previously imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 33 Russians and Crimeans for their part in Russia's seizure of Crimea last month.

Armed separatists loyal to Russia have been seeking more autonomy in eastern Ukraine, where they have seized government buildings, set up roadblocks or staged protests.

On Monday, Hennady Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, was shot by gunmen and was said to be undergoing surgery, according to his office.

Kernes was a staunch opponent of the pro-West Maidan movement that toppled President Viktor Yanukovich in February and was widely viewed as the organiser of activists sent to Kiev from eastern Ukraine to harass those demonstrators.

But he has since softened his stance towards the new Kiev government and insisted that he does not support the pro-Russia separatists or any annexation of Ukrainian territory.

Kiev’s government and its western allies bear full responsibility for the recent bloodshed in Ukraine, Russia’s presidential spokesman has said, adding it is now impossible to convince people in the region to disarm  because their lives are under threat.


  Spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Peskov,
  released an official statement following the tragic events in
  Odessa. 39 anti-government activists have died in a fire at the Trade Unions House there,
  after the building was set ablaze by pro-Kiev radicals. Some anti-Kiev protesters burned to death,
  while others suffocated or jumped out of windows, the Ukrainian
  Interior Ministry said.



  Peskov expressed deep condolences for the families of those who
  died in the tragedy on behalf of President Vladimir Putin and
  said the Kiev government and the West had blood on their hands.


“The authorities in Kiev not only bear direct responsibility,
  but are complicit in these criminal activities. Their arms are up
  to the elbows in blood,” Peskov said.



  He said the tragedy in Odessa was the product of “the
  connivance of those who consider themselves the authority in
  Kiev.”

“They allowed extremists and radicals to burn unarmed people
  alive. I stress that these people were unarmed.”


  Peskov condemned the position adopted by Washington and a number
  of European countries as motivated by cynicism.


“It is the highest manifestation of cynicism. The people who
  justify this punitive operation are the same ones that did not
  allow the legitimate President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovich, to
  bring order to the country,” said Peskov, referring to the
  special operation being carried out in the East of Ukraine at the
  order of the Kiev government.



  The latest escalation in the fighting in eastern Ukraine has made
  it impossible for any nation to convince people to disarm in the
  region because their lives are at risk, said Peskov.


“In spite of consistent attempts to encourage dialogue,
  Russia has hit against provocation not only from Kiev, but also
  its Western sponsors, he said, stressing that Russia could
  not find a solution to the current conflict on its own.



  Addressing the Ukrainian elections that are set to take place
  later this month, Peskov said the prospect of such a vote was
  “absurd” while violence continues to rage in the
  country.



  The president’s spokesperson announced on Friday that Kiev had
  effectively destroyed the last vestige of hope for implementing
  the Geneva agreement on de-escalating the Ukrainian crisis by
  unleashing a ‘punitive operation’ in eastern Ukraine. Russia
  views the operation as criminal and has urged the Ukrainian
  government not to use force against unarmed civilians.



  However, the EU and the US have both supported the Kiev
  government’s operation. President Barack Obama called it “a
  move to restore order,” while EU foreign policy chief
  Catherine Ashton said the state's monopoly on the legitimate
  use of violence needs to be respected.“Our colleagues in the West are basically trying to justify
  the large number of murders we are seeing,” said Peskov,
  calling Ashton’s statement “monstrous.”
  When asked how Russia would react to the escalating conflict in
  Ukraine, Peskov said he was unable to answer that question at
  present.
  “This is unknown territory for us,” said the
  presidential spokesperson, adding that the Russian government has
  received thousands of calls from southeastern Ukraine, demanding
  Moscow’s help.
  
  “Desperate people call, they ask for help. The vast majority want
  Russia’s help,” said Peskov. “All of these calls are
  reported to President Vladimir Putin.”","Moscow: Kiev and western sponsors directly responsible for bloodshed in E.Ukraine

Vladimir Putin is coming for you.

He has hated the Internet since at least 2010. That year, after allegations of corruption surfaced online, Putin delivered an impassioned screed against the Internet. He denied ever using the medium himself and expressed bafflement at why Russians seemed so keen on it. “On the Internet, 50 percent is porn material,” he confided. “Why should we refer to the Internet?” He then laid out this simile: “A political system shouldn’t wobble like liquid jelly every time it’s touched.”

But later, in 2012, as he campaigned to reclaim the presidency, he unveiled “Website Vladimir Putin.” The page showed, among other things, pictures of Putin fishing, rafting in a power boat, taming what appears to be a tiger, playing hockey, driving small cars and stretching in his judo outfit. Some Russians, according to Radio Free Europe, weren’t as enthralled with Putin’s many interests as he.

“Please leave politics,” begged one man identified as Andrei Antonenko in a comment posted on Website Vladimir Putin. “We understand that power is like a drug, but this would be a dignified act.” Another commenter, Mikhail Meshkov, pleaded: “A lot of my friends are thinking about leaving Russia. Do you need this? Do we? I don’t. I want to live in a normal country. So get out before it’s too late.”

The observations were immediately removed, Radio Free Europe reports, and replaced with statements praising Putin and calling on him to “impose censorship.”

One opposition leader named Alexei Navalny said: “Vladimir Putin and his team do not understand the Internet.” But according to Putin’s musings on Thursday, that conclusion couldn’t be more wrong. Putin has the Internet figured out. Speaking at a media event in St. Petersburg, Putin called the Internet a “CIA project,” which “is still developing as such.” To combat it, Putin said Russia must “fight for its interests” online.

Little, however, fuels a Web mob like attacks from state leaders. Just ask Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is still waging his own personal campaign against Twitter, after several high-profile backfires. “Twitter now toes the line!” one of his officials declared last weekend after Twitter blocked two accounts that had leaked recordings showing alleged corruption. Or consider China, which has stoked outrage over its recent war on Internet porn. Indeed, like other state leaders before, Putin took a drubbing online over his nascent CIA-internet hypothesis.

The comment, however, represents just the latest move Putin has taken against the Web since he was reelected Russia’s president. Although rarely as publicly as he did Thursday, Putin has methodically out-muscled some of the Internet’s strongest Russian voices with censorship, legislation and intimidation. The year Putin took back the Kremlin, this Freedom House study referred to the Internet in Russia as “the last relatively uncensored platform for public debate.” This assessment, however, was something Putin evidently could not abide.

In the months following, the government sued and fined three Internet service providers, according to the Ria Novosti news agency. Then, the government blacklisted Russia’s Facebook, VKontakte. Putin backed off the banning, saying it had been an accident. “This was a mistake,” he explained. “Our employee put a tick in the wrong place.” By October 2013, Russia’s Internet ranking by Freedom House had dropped 10 spots — placing it between Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

But Putin was only getting started. The Russia State Duma adopted on Tuesday new legislation aimed at “Internet users called bloggers.” Any blog that clocks more than 3,000 daily visitors must now register with the state body for media oversight. Those blogs now need to verify information for accuracy and will be held accountable for any third-party comment posted on their sites or social media.

Pavel Durov, the founder of Russia’s equivalent of Facebook, announced he had been fired from his job as CEO and that the social network is now under “full control” of oligarchs belonging to Putin’s inner circle. Durov then fled the country.

Thursday, Putin was still complaining about the Internet. Beyond voicing concerns over alleged CIA involvement, he also took aim at Yandex, a search engine that’s bigger in Russia than Google. He complained that the company was registered in the Netherlands ”not only for tax reasons but for other considerations, too.”

After Putin was done lambasting all things Internet, Russian tech stocks did this:

In the east, pro-Russian separatists brought down two Ukrainian military helicopters involved in a pre-dawn operation to try to dislodge the militants from their strongholds in the town of Slaviansk.

The separatists said three of their number had been killed, and two civilians, while the defense ministry said two crew from the downed helicopters died and two other servicemen were killed when separatists attacked them on Friday evening.

Heavy fighting is continuing, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said. Russian media also said fighting had broken out overnight near the town of Kramatorsk, just south of Slaviansk, but Reuters could not independently confirm the reports.

Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine has been the focus of concern in Western capitals since pro-Russian gunmen overran the region after Moscow annexed mainly Russian Crimea from Ukraine in March. Clashes had also occurred in largely Russian-speaking Odessa, not far from Crimea, but no one had died there before.

Police said three people were shot dead and dozens of others wounded in running battles between people backing Kiev and pro-Russian activists in the port city. Another man died later and a further 31 people were killed when a trade union building was set on fire as fighting continued into the evening, police said.

The total death toll in Odessa later reached 43, Interfax-Ukraine reported.

President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said Ukrainian forces had fired on civilians from the air in Slaviansk in a punitive operation that destroyed an international peace plan. Moscow has tens of thousands of troops massed on the border and claims the right to invade if needed to protect Russian speakers.

The Western-backed government in Kiev said the use of missiles to bring down its helicopters showed Russian forces were already in the town and also that Russian armed saboteurs had tried to enter the country overnight, but were pushed back by Ukrainian border troops.

Moscow denies involvement with the rebels and its Security Service said the incursion report was untrue.

Kiev said it was forced to act in eastern Ukraine because Moscow was backing groups there who were putting civilians in danger, seizing hostages and creating an atmosphere of terror and violence.

Reuters journalists in Slaviansk, the most heavily fortified bastion of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, heard shooting and saw one helicopter opening fire before dawn. Later in the day, the city was largely quiet, with shops shut and armed separatists in control of the streets.

Advancing Ukrainian forces in armored vehicles took up positions in the suburbs, but rebels still controlled most of the town of 130,000.

Acting President Oleksander Turchinov said the operation had been complicated by the rebels' use of human shields and had not progressed as quickly as had been hoped.

SOUND OF CANNON

The growing chaos is overshadowing a presidential election the pro-Western leadership in Kiev is planning for May 25. The rebels are planning a vote on May 11 to seek a mandate to break with Kiev, like one held in Crimea before Moscow took it over.

Moscow moved in on Crimea following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Moscow president by protesters angered by his decision to scrap a trade deal with Europe.

The United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on individuals over the Ukraine crisis but they have had limited impact. U.S. President Barack Obama said the next step would be sanctions on sectors of the Russian economy and they would be imposed if Moscow impeded the Ukrainian presidential poll.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, visiting Washington, told a joint news conference with Obama that the elections on May 25 were critical and sectoral sanctions were ready.

The energy and banking sectors are likely targets.

On the square outside city hall in Slaviansk, about 100 people gathered on Friday and said they were appealing to Putin to send troops to help them.

Businesswoman Tamara Voshchanaya said: What can you think when the sound of cannon makes you jump out of bed, when helicopters are flying over and shooting at our guys?

On the town's southern outskirts, eight Ukrainian armored personnel carriers cut off the road but faced a cordon of local residents shouting at them to go home. Some rebels erected barricades of trees.

Putin's popularity has soared with the seizure of Crimea and talk of restoring Moscow's former empire. This week he restored the Soviet-era tradition of holding a May Day parade on Red Square, where marchers carried banners hailing the acquisition of Ukrainian territory.

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Russia's actions in Ukraine had shattered the myth of European security in the post-Cold War era and said NATO allies had increased the danger by failing to meet their defense spending pledges.

The European Union said it was watching events in eastern Ukraine with growing concern. But Kiev is not a member of NATO and Western leaders have made clear they will not fight to defend Ukraine.

HELICOPTERS DOWN

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said two Mi-24 attack helicopters had been shot down by shoulder-launched missiles while on patrol overnight around Slaviansk. Two airmen were killed and others wounded.

Other Ukrainian officials and the separatist leader in Slaviansk said earlier that one airman was taken prisoner.

A third helicopter, an Mi-8 transport aircraft, was also hit and a serviceman wounded, the Defense Ministry said. The SBU security service said this helicopter was carrying medics.

Ukrainian officials said their troops overran rebel checkpoints and Slaviansk was now tightly encircled.

Putin's spokesman heaped blame on the Ukrainian government, which took power two months ago after pro-Western protests forced president Viktor Yanukovich to flee to Russia.

Saying that Putin had warned before that any punitive operation would be a criminal act, Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that this had now happened in Slaviansk.

While Russia is making efforts to de-escalate and settle the conflict, the Kiev regime has turned to firing on civilian towns with military aircraft and has begun a punitive operation, effectively destroying the last hope of survival for the Geneva accord, he said, referring to a deal on April 17 signed by Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union.

Under that agreement, separatists were supposed to lay down their arms and vacate the public buildings they have seized in about a dozen towns they have seized across the Russian-speaking east. Since then, however, they have tightened their grip.

Ukraine's Interior Ministry said it persuaded separatists to leave two buildings in the city of Luhansk on Friday.

The SBU said the deadly use by the separatists of shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles was evidence that trained, highly qualified foreign military specialists were operating in the area and not local civilians, as the Russian government says, armed only with guns taken from hunting stores.

?Energy-pinched Ukraine has reached a deal to start reverse gas flows from Central European neighbors via an unused pipeline to Slovakia. Starting from October, Ukraine will import 3.2 billion cubic meters of gas.


  Ukraine and Slovakia signed a memorandum of intent in Bratislava
  on Monday. The European Commission said the cooperation between
  Slovakia and Ukraine is a “win-win for both parties”.


“It shows the EU's strong commitment in support of Ukraine's
  energy sector, which is also reflected in the economic and
  financial package the Union has swiftly provided for Ukraine in
  the past weeks. I would like to thank Energy Commissioner
  Oettinger and his team, who played a central role in paving the
  way for today’s agreement,” Jose Barroso, President of the
  European Commission, who attended the ceremony, said in a
  statement.



  By next spring, deliveries from Vojany, Slovakia to the western
  Ukrainian city of Uzhorod could reach 10 billion cubic meters,
  the amount European Commissioner for Energy Gunter Oettinger
  requested.



  Deliveries from Slovakia could satisfy up to 20 percent of
  Ukraine’s natural gas demand, which in 2013 was 55 billion cubic
  meters.



  In April, German energy company RWE started delivering gas to Ukraine using reverse flow
  through Poland. The gas is being supplied under a 2012 contract
  where RWE can deliver up to 10 billion cubic meters of gas to
  Ukraine per year.



  Between these two deals alone, Ukraine has upped its supply from
  Europe ten-fold. Last year Ukraine imported around 2 billion
  cubic meters of gas from EU member states.



  Ukraine imports nearly 50 percent of its natural gas from Russia,
  a country it now finds itself at diplomatic ends with, as it
  moves towards possible EU integration. In 2013, the country
  bought 27.7 billion meters, from Gazprom, Russia’s largest
  state-owned natural gas producer.



  The deal is a short-term solution for Ukraine, which can no
  longer afford Russian gas after Moscow cancelled all gas
  discounts for Kiev, as it waits for Ukraine to repay an overdue
  gas bill of $2.2 billion.



  Ukraine’s Energy Ministry was hoping to unlock more gas imports
  from its European neighbors, but Slovakian authorities must be
  careful not avoid any legal issues with Gazprom.



  Currently Ukraine needs to pay $485 per thousand cubic meters for Russian gas,
  which compares to $268.5 agreed between Russia and Ukraine in
  December.



  Ukraine currently has a “take-and-pay” contract with Gazprom
  which it is required to buy 41.6 billion cubic meters of gas in
  order to receive discount prices. In 2013, Ukraine only bough
  12.9 billion cubic meters of gas, which prompted Gazprom last
  week to send Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state oil and gas company, a
  bill for $11.4 billion.



  Ukraine presidential candidate Pyotr Poroshenko has said that by
  2015, Ukraine will stop buying Russian gas. More neighbors may be
  tapped to start supplying gas to Ukraine, perhaps Poland or
  Hungary.



  Time to diversify?



  In the wake of the Ukraine crisis, many of Gazprom's European customers
  have been second-guessing Russian gas, and have renewed
  conversations of lessening dependence from their powerful
  neighbor.



  Many countries in Eastern Europe believe the continent can
  achieve energy security and at the same time retain relations
  with Russia. Croatian President Ivo Josipovic doesn't see the
  energy as a zero sum game.


Diversifying supplies does not mean that the EU’s current
  gas, oil and coal suppliers, primarily Russia and Norway, will
  not continue to be important energy partners of the EU. What will
  change is that EU member countries will have more conceivable
  alternatives in the interest of energy security, Josipovic
  
  wrote in an FT opinion piece on Monday.



  Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk has been a main proponent of
  diversifying Europe's imports as well as developing
  shale, but their is still discord among much of Europe. In
  terms of developing shale, many states in Europe have banned the
  practice, while others, like Croatia, are taking a more cautious
  approach, than say, Poland or the UK.



  Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Bulgaria and the Czech
  Republic import 100 percent of their natural gas from Russia and
  logically want to diversify their import options. Other countries
  like Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia, and Italy are very keen
  to continue doing business with Russia, especially on Gazprom's
  'South Stream' project, which by 2018 will supply 64 billion
  cubic meters of natural gas to European markets.","Ukraine strikes 3.2 bcm reverse gas flow deal with Slovakia

  which it is required to buy 41.6 billion cubic meters of gas in
  order to receive discount prices. In 2013, Ukraine only bough
  12.9 billion cubic meters of gas, which prompted Gazprom last
  week to send Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state oil and gas company, a
  bill for $11.4 billion.



  Ukraine presidential candidate Pyotr Poroshenko has said that by
  2015, Ukraine will stop buying Russian gas. More neighbors may be
  tapped to start supplying gas to Ukraine, perhaps Poland or
  Hungary.



  Time to diversify?



  In the wake of the Ukraine crisis, many of Gazprom's European customers
  have been second-guessing Russian gas, and have renewed
  conversations of lessening dependence from their powerful
  neighbor.



  Many countries in Eastern Europe believe the continent can
  achieve energy security and at the same time retain relations
  with Russia. Croatian President Ivo Josipovic doesn't see the
  energy as a zero sum game.


Diversifying supplies does not mean that the EU’s current
  gas, oil and coal suppliers, primarily Russia and Norway, will
  not continue to be important energy partners of the EU. What will
  change is that EU member countries will have more conceivable
  alternatives in the interest of energy security, Josipovic
  
  wrote in an FT opinion piece on Monday.



  Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk has been a main proponent of
  diversifying Europe's imports as well as developing
  shale, but their is still discord among much of Europe. In
  terms of developing shale, many states in Europe have banned the
  practice, while others, like Croatia, are taking a more cautious
  approach, than say, Poland or the UK.



  Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Bulgaria and the Czech
  Republic import 100 percent of their natural gas from Russia and
  logically want to diversify their import options. Other countries
  like Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia, and Italy are very keen
  to continue doing business with Russia, especially on Gazprom's
  'South Stream' project, which by 2018 will supply 64 billion
  cubic meters of natural gas to European markets.",836

Pro-Russian rebels in the east freed seven European military observers on Saturday after holding them hostage for eight days, while Kiev pressed on with its biggest military operation so far to reclaim rebel-held territory in the area.

The riot in the Black Sea port of Odessa, ending in a deadly blaze in a besieged trade union building, was by far the worst incident in Ukraine since a February uprising that ended with a pro-Russian president fleeing the country.

A couple of hundred pro-Russian protesters in the eastern city of Donetsk stormed the governor's business premises and the state security headquarters, ransacking files and smashing windows. The attack reflected growing disorder in the area, targeting as it did a security building that had already been brought under rebel control.

This is for yesterday! said Tatiana Kamniva outside the governor's office. They're monsters, worse than monsters.

The Odessa clashes spread the violence from the eastern separatist heartland to an area far from the Russian frontier, raising the prospect of unrest sweeping more broadly across a country of around 45 million people the size of France.

The Kremlin, which has massed tens of thousands of soldiers on Ukraine's eastern border and proclaims the right to invade to protect Russian speakers, said the government in Kiev and its Western backers were responsible for the deaths.

Kiev said the violence was provoked by foreign demonstrators sent in from Transdniestria, a nearby breakaway pro-Russian region of Moldova where Moscow has a military garrison. It said most of the dead who had been identified so far were from there.

On Saturday morning, people placed flowers near the burnt-out doors of the trade union building, lighting candles and putting up the yellow, white and red flag of the city. About 2,000 pro-Russian protesters outside the burnt-out building chanted Odessa is a Russian city.

Events took a violent turn on Friday when a column of soccer supporters, chanting support for Ukraine's leaders, clashed with men in black, some firing pistols. Television pictures showed police caught between the two sides.

Clashes then spread along the streets until rebels moved into a large trade union building. Petrol bombs were thrown and shots were heard though the exact sequence and detail of events remained unclear on Saturday.

Oleg Konstantinov, a journalist covering the events for a local Internet site, said bullets had flown in the melee before the blaze: I was hit in the arm, then I started crawling, and then got hit in the back and leg.

The Odessa bloodshed came on the same day that Kiev launched its biggest push yet to reassert its control over separatist areas in the east, hundreds of kilometers away, where armed pro-Russian rebels have proclaimed a People's Republic of Donetsk.

The rebels there aim to hold a referendum on May 11 on secession from Ukraine, similar to one staged in March in Ukraine's Crimea region, which was seized and annexed by Russia in a move that overturned the post-Cold War diplomatic order.

NOT STOPPING

On Saturday the government said it was pressing on with the offensive in the area for a second day, and had recaptured a television tower and a security services building from rebels in Kramatorsk, a town near the rebel stronghold of Slaviansk. Health authorities said six people were killed in fighting.

We are not stopping, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said in a post on Facebook.

The Donetsk region administration said snipers were shooting from rooftops in Kramatorsk, shops were closing and there was an atmosphere of panic. A Reuters correspondent reported in late afternoon, however, that the town was quiet.

Vasyl Krutov, head of a government anti-terrorist center behind the operation in the east, told a news conference: What we are facing in the Donetsk region and in the eastern regions is not just some kind of short-lived uprising, it is in fact a war.

The military operation in the east was overshadowed by the unprecedented violence in Odessa, a vibrant multi-ethnic port city that has seen some support for separatists but nothing like the riots that erupted on Friday.

Police said four people were killed, at least three shot dead, and dozens wounded in running battles between people backing Kiev and pro-Russian activists. The clashes ended with separatists holed up in the trade union building.

At least 37 people died in the blaze. On Saturday, police raised the death toll in the city to 42, easily the biggest toll since about 100 people were killed in Kiev protests that toppled pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovich in February.

Kiev and its Western sponsors are practically provoking the bloodshed and bear direct responsibility for it, RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters.

Kiev's Interior Ministry blamed the pro-Russian protesters, saying they had attacked the pro-Ukrainians before retreating to the trade union headquarters, from where they opened fire on the crowd and threw out the petrol bombs that caused the blaze.

Odessa is located in the southwest of Ukraine, far from the eastern areas held by the rebels and far from the Russian frontier where Moscow has amassed forces. But it is close to Moldova's Transdniestria region, where Russia also has troops.

The spread of violence to Odessa expands the zone of unrest across the breadth of southern and eastern Ukraine.

Today we Ukrainians are constantly being pushed into confrontation, into civil conflict, toward the destruction of our country to its heart. We cannot allow this to happen, said acting President Oleksander Turchinov.

Regional police chief Petro Lutsiuk said on Saturday more than 130 people had been detained and could face charges ranging from participating in riots to premeditated murder.

BIRTHDAY GUESTS

The release of the military monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe resolves a major diplomatic issue for the West.

Moscow said the release showed the bravery and humanism of the rebels defending Slaviansk. Western officials, including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, welcomed the release but said Russia should still do more to help de-escalate the crisis.

Kerry spoke to Russian Foreign Mininster Sergei Lavrov by telephone. Both sides said they agreed that the OSCE should play a bigger role in helping to reduce tension.

The separatists had captured the monitor team on April 25 and described them as prisoners of war. One Swede was freed earlier on health grounds while four Germans, a Czech, a Dane and a Pole were still being held until Saturday.

The separatist leader in Slaviansk, self-proclaimed people's mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said they were freed along with five Ukrainian captives, with no conditions.

As I promised them, we celebrated my birthday yesterday and they left. As I said, they were my guests.

The OSCE team's leader, German Colonel Axel Schneider, speaking on the road out of Slaviansk after being freed, said: You can imagine, it's a big relief. The situation was really tough. The last two nights when you see what was going on, every minute gets longer.

He praised his captor Ponomaryov as a man whose word counts a lot. He's a man who listens.

Western countries accuse Russia of stoking the separatism and fear Moscow could be planning to repeat its annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine.

Russia denies it has such plans, while saying it could intervene if necessary to protect Russian speakers, a new doctrine unveiled by President Vladimir Putin in March that overturned decades of post-Soviet diplomacy.

The West has made clear it will not use military force to protect Ukraine but will rely on economic sanctions against Moscow to, in the words of U.S. President Barack Obama, change Putin's calculus.

"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/worldNews/~3/D9w3Y-ylmxc/story01.htm","REUTERS","2014-04-30T15:20:42.0","India turns to Russia to help supply arms to Afghan forces","India turns to Russia to help supply arms to Afghan forcesNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has signed an agreement under which it will pay Russia to supply arms and equipment to the Afghan military as foreign combat troops prepare to leave the country, in a move that risks infuriating Pakistan.

Under the deal, smaller arms such as light artillery and mortars will be sourced from Russia and moved to Afghanistan.

But it could eventually involve the transfer of heavy artillery, tanks and even combat helicopters that the Afghans have been asking India for since last year.

India has already been training military officers from Afghanistan, hosted a 60-member Special Forces group last year in the deserts of Rajasthan and supplied equipment such as combat vehicles and field medical support facilities.

But the decision to meet some of Afghanistan's military hardware demands - albeit sourcing them from Russia - points to a deepening role in Afghanistan aimed at preventing it from slipping back into the hands of the Taliban and other Islamist groups that are hostile to India.

It comes as China, another big player in the region which borders Afghanistan via a small, remote strip of land, is preparing for a more robust role in Afghanistan, also concerned that the withdrawal of NATO troops will leave a hotbed of militancy on its doorstep.

Like China, India is unlikely to put boots on the ground to reinforce its strategy in Afghanistan.

We can't commit troops on the ground, we can't give them the military equipment that they have been asking us for, for all sorts of reasons including the lack of surplus stocks, said an Indian foreign ministry official, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Involving a third party is the next best option, the official said, referring to plans to source military supplies from Russia for Afghan forces.

The lack of direct access to Afghanistan poses additional hurdles to arms transfers.

An Indian team visited Moscow in February to firm up the deal, the official said.

The two countries will also help Afghanistan restart an old armaments factory near Kabul and prepare an inventory of Russian military equipment in Afghanistan that could be refitted for use. That dates back to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89, although much of the hardware is beyond repair.

We'll work with India directly as well as trilaterally involving Russia, said an Afghan official in New Delhi.

Most of India's weapons are made in Russia or co-produced with Russia, so it makes sense. Also the three-way arrangement is cost-effective.

Indian officials said they had held talks with China, Japan and Iran to find ways to fund Afghan security demands that outgoing President Hamid Karzai told his Indian hosts during a visit last year would touch $4 billion a year.

PAKISTAN WARY

India's neighbor and rival Pakistan is likely to be angered by any move to help arm Afghan forces, even if indirectly.

Pakistan shares a long border with Afghanistan and has traditionally exerted considerable influence on Kabul.

But under Karzai, and since the ouster of the Islamist Taliban movement in 2001, relations have deteriorated amid accusations that Pakistan has failed to stop militants crossing into Afghanistan and launching frequent, deadly attacks.

Asked about India's plans to supply Russian arms to Afghanistan, Pakistani foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said: I don't have any confirmation, so it would be premature to comment on it.

A military spokesman did not return calls seeking comment.

Ahmed Rashid, an author and expert on the region, said the deal could aggravate relations between India and Pakistan - nuclear-armed neighbors who have fought three wars - if the arms supplied were heavy enough to be deemed offensive.

Diplomacy and political dialogue are what will bring peace to Afghanistan, he said. What is not going to bring peace is more weapons.

Russia's Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, the state agency responsible for arms and military cooperation deals, declined comment on the agreement.

But Alexander Golts, an independent Moscow-based defense expert, said Russia had a similar arrangement with the United States under which it had delivered Mi-17 helicopters to Afghanistan.

The program is now threatened by U.S. sanctions on Russian government officials and firms linked to President Vladimir Putin as punishment for intervention in Ukraine, he said.

Golts said India and Russia were likely to play a significant role in Afghanistan as coalition troops withdraw.

At the end of the day, and despite all the contradictions, it's very important for Washington to keep Russia engaged in Afghanistan.

Karzai's shopping list submitted to New Delhi last year comprised 66 items ranging from tanks to spares for Afghanistan's small fleet of helicopters.

Karzai also wanted Indian instructors at the British-funded Sandhurst in the Sand military academy built outside Kabul to train Afghan military officers.

New Delhi remains opposed to deploying troops, including trainers, but has increased the number of Afghan officers training in India to nearly 1,100 this year from last year's 574.

It is very clear that the Afghan government has been pushing for this, especially Karzai, to make sure that the ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces) is stocked and has options post-withdrawal, said Rudra Chaudhuri, a South Asia specialist at King's College London, referring to India's decision to arrange for supplies from Russia.

India's trying to help with Afghan demands but being cautious as well.

The program is now threatened by U.S. sanctions on Russian government officials and firms linked to President Vladimir Putin as punishment for intervention in Ukraine, he said.

Golts said India and Russia were likely to play a significant role in Afghanistan as coalition troops withdraw.

At the end of the day, and despite all the contradictions, it's very important for Washington to keep Russia engaged in Afghanistan.

Karzai's shopping list submitted to New Delhi last year comprised 66 items ranging from tanks to spares for Afghanistan's small fleet of helicopters.

Karzai also wanted Indian instructors at the British-funded Sandhurst in the Sand military academy built outside Kabul to train Afghan military officers.

New Delhi remains opposed to deploying troops, including trainers, but has increased the number of Afghan officers training in India to nearly 1,100 this year from last year's 574.

It is very clear that the Afghan government has been pushing for this, especially Karzai, to make sure that the ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces) is stocked and has options post-withdrawal, said Rudra Chaudhuri, a South Asia specialist at King's College London, referring to India's decision to arrange for supplies from Russia.

India's trying to help with Afghan demands but being cautious as well.

“In particular, we demand the release of my deputy Ihor Perepechayenko,” Vyacheslav Ponomaryov said. “To put it crudely, he was kidnapped and now his whereabouts are unknown,” he added.

Ponomaryov said last week his ally Perepechayenko was detained by the Ukrainian Security Service at an airport in the city of Donetsk as he was returning from Moscow, where he had taken part in a political talk show at a Russian TV channel.

“A range of our supporters, our friends are being held by the junta. If we have such a chance, we are ready for the swap,” Ponomaryov said.

Last week, federalization supporters stopped a bus carrying OSCE monitors at a checkpoint and found that the observers were accompanied by Ukrainian officers, Ponomarev said. The activists detained 11 members of the military mission, eight Europeans and three Ukrainians among them, who are suspected of “espionage,” Ponomaryov said. The driver of the OSCE bus, a citizen of Ukraine, has been released.

After talks on Sunday, the self-defense forces agreed to release one of the OSCE team’s members, a Swedish military officer named Ingvi Thomas Johanson.

Wednesday’s action by the IMF’s 24-member executive board, which includes representatives from Russia and the United States, opens the way for an immediate release of $3.2bn to Ukraine, which faces deep fiscal problems in addition to months of political crisis.

The loans are subject to IMF demands that Ukraine cuts subsidies for fuel, reduces its large deficit, controls pay rises, reduces corruption, and reforms its banking system.

Pro-Moscow separatists seized government offices in more Ukrainian towns on Wednesday, a further sign that authorities in Kiev are losing control of the country's eastern industrial heartland that borders Russia.

The unrest in the east follows months of upheaval from anti-government protests and Russia's subsequent annexation of the Crimea region, which had already pushed Ukraine's economy to the brink of bankruptcy.

Christine Lagarde, IMF managing director and chair, said: “Deep-seated vulnerabilities—together with political shocks—have led to a major crisis in Ukraine. The economy is in recession, fiscal balances have deteriorated, and the financial sector is under significant stress.

“Risks to the programme are high. In particular, further escalation of tensions with Russia and unrest in the east of the country pose a substantial risk to the economic outlook.

The international organisation has warned that the Ukraine economy faces a 5 percent contraction this year, even with the two-year loan deal.

Some of the initial disbursements could be turned around to pay off an outstanding $2.2bn bill for natural gas from Russia, which has threatened to cut off fuel supplies to its former Soviet republic, according to the AFP news agency.

The country already owes the IMF money under previous loan programmes. but the new loan could be used to repay off that.

Subsidy cuts urged

The IMF has been wary about lending to Ukraine after two previous loan plans since 2008 failed because of the government's lack of adherence to reform conditions set by the global body.

It has insisted on the reduction of huge fuel subsidies and improved efforts against widespread corruption in the government.

The Ukrainian government, in power until elections are held on May 25, has already promised to raise natural gas prices by more than 50 percent from Thursday. 

However, the overthrow of the pro-Russia government of President Viktor Yanukovich in February, and the installation of a pro-Western interim government that pledged reforms, opened the door to a new loan programme.

Acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has promised to implement the IMF-proposed reforms, including a fuel hike that will be unpopular and politically difficult to enact.

The Kiev authorities put the lives of military observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at risk by starting a punitive operation against peaceful people in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday, May 3.

“None of the more or less prepared analyst had any doubt that these observers were sent to Slavyansk by the Ukrainian side and their well-known sponsors in order to create a new pocket of tensions and thus escalate the situation and draw European states into the international Ukrainian conflict,” Foreign Ministry deputy spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

“Not only did the Kiev clique fail to think about the security of the inspectors but it also directly threatened their lives by starting a punitive operation against the peaceful residents of Slavyansk,” she said.

“Only a noble and responsible position of the local self-defence forces’ leaders, who agreed to release the inspectors promptly without preconditions amid the deteriorating situation, basically saved the foreigners’ lives. In fact, it’s obvious that no one can be guaranteed against anything during a massive army operation,” Zakharova said.

The concoctions that the observers’ capture was orchestrated by Moscow, which are actively circulating in Ukrainian mass media, “are not a reflection of the inflamed imagination of Kiev dummies but a thoroughly considered action against the observers they invited themselves”, she said.

Self-defence forces in Slavyansk helped to release the OSCE military observers to keep them away from Kiev’s punitive operation in the south-eastern regions of the country, the Foreign Ministry said.

Responding to requests from the OSCE and European leaders, Russia took energetic steps over the past several days to secure the release of the military observers detained by local militia on April 25.

Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his special envoy Vladimir Lukin to the region to mediate the talks on their release. The mission resulted in the release of the OSCE observers. Lukin took them to Donetsk.

“This step was taken by the Slavyansk self-defence forces despite Kiev’s purposeful escalation of the internal conflict at a time when the peaceful city is under a direct and unmotivated attack involving the Armed Forces and Right Sector militants clad in National Guard uniform. Undoubtedly, this testifies to the courage and humanism of the city defenders. They showed their care about the security of foreign citizens so that they were not affected by the punitive operation,” the ministry said.","MOSCOW, May 03. /ITAR-TASS/.

“None of the more or less prepared analyst had any doubt that these observers were sent to Slavyansk by the Ukrainian side and their well-known sponsors in order to create a new pocket of tensions and thus escalate the situation and draw European states into the international Ukrainian conflict,” Foreign Ministry deputy spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

“Not only did the Kiev clique fail to think about the security of the inspectors but it also directly threatened their lives by starting a punitive operation against the peaceful residents of Slavyansk,” she said.

“Only a noble and responsible position of the local self-defence forces’ leaders, who agreed to release the inspectors promptly without preconditions amid the deteriorating situation, basically saved the foreigners’ lives. In fact, it’s obvious that no one can be guaranteed against anything during a massive army operation,” Zakharova said.

The concoctions that the observers’ capture was orchestrated by Moscow, which are actively circulating in Ukrainian mass media, “are not a reflection of the inflamed imagination of Kiev dummies but a thoroughly considered action against the observers they invited themselves”, she said.

Self-defence forces in Slavyansk helped to release the OSCE military observers to keep them away from Kiev’s punitive operation in the south-eastern regions of the country, the Foreign Ministry said.

Responding to requests from the OSCE and European leaders, Russia took energetic steps over the past several days to secure the release of the military observers detained by local militia on April 25.

Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his special envoy Vladimir Lukin to the region to mediate the talks on their release. The mission resulted in the release of the OSCE observers. Lukin took them to Donetsk.

“This step was taken by the Slavyansk self-defence forces despite Kiev’s purposeful escalation of the internal conflict at a time when the peaceful city is under a direct and unmotivated attack involving the Armed Forces and Right Sector militants clad in National Guard uniform. Undoubtedly, this testifies to the courage and humanism of the city defenders. They showed their care about the security of foreign citizens so that they were not affected by the punitive operation,” the ministry said.",464

Washington's approach to the events in Ukraine is not fueled by concerns about the fate of the crisis-torn state, but rather by the desire to prove it is still running the show worldwide, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.


  The way the situation in Ukraine is reported in mainstream media
  indicates that “unfortunately, the information machine of our
  Western colleagues is working at full capacity,” Lavrov said
  following talks with his Chilean counterpart, Heraldo Munoz, in
  Santiago.



  The US is trying to shape public opinion in a specific manner
  “because they are not concerned by the fate of Ukraine in the
  first place, but have strong desire to prove that it’s them who
  decides how things should be – always and everywhere,”
  Lavrov stated.



  The foreign minister stressed that sanctions imposed on Russia by
  the US and its allies are the result of such a stance, and will
  have a costly outcome for Washington in the long run.



  However, Moscow currently has no plans to retaliate against the
  “meaningless” sanctions from the West, he said.


“At this stage, we want to give our partners a chance to calm
  down,” Lavrov said. “We’ll see what happens next. If
  absolutely baseless notations towards Russia will continue, if
  there are attempts to pressure us with economic leverage, then we
  may reevaluate the situation.”


  Lavrov has advised the US to “discipline those whom they
  brought to power in Ukraine” instead of sanctioning Moscow.



  He stated that despite declaring themselves “winners of the
  democratic revolution,” the current government in Kiev is
  based “on a coalition which includes candid radicals and
  extremists, condemned even by the EU back in 2012 when the
  Svoboda party first made it to parliament.”


  “But now the Europeans are shyly forgetting about that and
  cooperate with those same people,” Lavrov added.
  
  The minister stressed the need to establish a direct dialogue
  between the coup-imposed Ukrainian authorities and protestors in
  the nation's southeast in order to solve the crisis in the
  country.
  
  “The role of Russia, the US, and Europe, or any other
  interested state, isn’t about blanching one of sides of the
  Ukrainian conflict,” he said.



  Lavrov also stated that Moscow has made an attempt to establish a
  dialogue by proposing a ‘round table’ discussion between Kiev and
  representatives of the southeastern regions within the framework
  of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
  (OSCE).
  
  “However, the US and EU representatives have blocked this
  initiative,” he stressed. “This is sad. We’ll continue
  to call for the full implementation of the Geneva Declaration,
  which our partners are trying to distance themselves from.”
  As for the OSCE observers who are still being held by anti-Kiev
  protesters in the town of Slavyansk, Russia is “urging for them
  to be released,” Lavrov said.



  “But we cannot decide for the self-defense forces,” he
  added. “Those people live under a constant threat coming from
  Kiev that the military and armored vehicles will be used against
  them; under constant threat from the extremists.”
  Southeastern Ukraine has been gripped by ongoing protests, with
  the majority of its Russian-speaking population refusing to
  recognize the new authorities in Kiev, who took the reins via a
  military coup powered by far-right radicals.
  
  Activists in Donetsk, Lugansk, and other regions have seized
  government buildings and are demanding a referendum on
  federalization.
  
  Despite failing to provide any proof, Washington continues to
  blame Moscow for masterminding the uprising in Ukraine's

  businessmen, as well as several companies.","US doesn’t care about Ukraine, wants to prove it's still in charge – Lavrov

As Moscow withdrew its troops from the border with Ukraine, President Obama announced further sanctions against Russian politicians and businessmen to a chorus of economists gleefully predicting the havoc to be wrought on the Russian economy.


  Of course, there’s not much evidence that sanctions have every
  actually achieved anything beyond making life difficult for
  lesser or greater numbers of people. Furthermore, the entire idea
  runs counter to the creed of global market liberalization so
  openly embraced by the very people who support slapping sanctions
  on anyone who indicates that they may not be in complete accord
  with them on each and every topic under the sun.



  The World Trade Organization (WTO), for example, was supposed to
  prevent nations from using their economies as a tool in the
  service of their own political interests. This has long served as
  the rationale for the WTO’s limited consideration of social
  rights or the environment when rendering its decisions.



  In the world of international law, sanctions are therefore a bit
  pass?, really. They may have sounded like a good idea 20 years
  ago, but we’ve all moved on since then.



  Thus, the idea that the USA and Europe are somehow going to
  bludgeon Russia into submission using a tool that
  much-more-vulnerable Cuba has blithely held out against for over
  half a century, is at first glance, worth a laugh. After all,
  it’s an open secret that the only country the US has managed to
  isolate with its sanctions has long been itself. In fact, before
  Gaddafi was ousted in 2011, the United States was – thanks to the
  long-standing Pan-Am controversy – virtually the only country
  that wasn’t getting oil concessions out of Libya.



  Much has been said about the overweening arrogance sanctioning
  Russia displays Max Keiser’s article earlier this week was particularly
  interesting, especially since it hasn’t been possible to portray
  these sanctions as the usual punishment for not having a
  ‘democratic’ government. Are Western leaders really so
  out of touch that they think Russia will give in because it is
  being sanctioned by the US and Europe?



  I doubt it.



  There’s a deeper game here and it is as follows: 1) sanctioning
  Russia makes it look like Western leaders are actually doing
  something (thereby satisfying public opinion at home); 2) if I
  were a betting woman, I would put money on it coming out someday
  that these sanctions were laid down in a manner curiously
  advantageous to certain Western businesses; 3) as far as Western
  leaders are concerned it isn’t Russia that is the problem, it’s
  Putin. I think they’ve gotten the message that Putin is not the
  ‘caving in’ type. So rather than get him to back down,
  they’d probably rather just get rid of him. Hence the litany of
  complaints personally directed against Putin over the past
  several months.



  It might surprise many Russians to learn that a large segment of
  the North American population believes that Vladimir Putin is an
  unelected dictator and that they are paranoid of being put under
  surveillance by him. I understand that you may need to read that
  twice to take it all in. Most people react to my telling them
  that I write for RT as if I have just announced that I have a
  license to kill.



  But difficult as it is, try to see things from the point of view
  of your average Western power-broker. They can remember the good
  old times, when Yeltsin was in charge (using that term loosely)
  and Russia was an investment bonanza, a real “free
  market”, plentiful in crony capitalism with minimal social
  security and all the natural resources you can take.



  They would like that back.



  And after that, they would like a similar arrangement in China,
  please.



  Once that is accomplished everyone will finally be on the same
  wavelength and the world will be remarkably conflict-free. It
  wouldn’t matter so much where Ukraine chose to make its political
  and economic alliances, because under this scenario the money
  would all be flowing into the same pockets, anyway and at a rate
  rapid enough to keep everyone satisfied.



  And Western leaders think that they have a certain chance of
  getting Part 1 of their policy taken care of, because they are
  hoping that if they can cause the Russian economy to tank, it
  will eventually, when the dust has settled, hit Putin’s
  popularity so hard as to hurt his chances of re-election. This is
  a basic tactic that is used a lot in international negotiations.
  It’s played by getting anyone you think is a tough negotiator
  removed from their job by spreading misinformation about them
  back to their home government or simply outright demanding that
  the home government sack them in order for negotiations to
  proceed at all.



  You can see both of these tactics at play in regards to Putin at
  the moment. I’m all for a healthy dose of criticism in domestic
  politics, but Russia as spy state using covert operations to
  topple governments while simultaneously placing us all under
  surveillance sounds a lot like Western leaders just cobbled
  together everyone’s complaints about them and hurled them at the
  new/old arch-enemy. Classic misinformation.



  Sanctions are an example of tactic two: I don’t like you so I’m
  not going to deal with you. If your country wants to talk to me
  they have to send someone with a better attitude, which means
  someone who thinks that the word ‘negotiation’ means that we do
  whatever I want. People sometimes wonder at the high proportion
  of idiots given government posts. Now you know. If you have a
  backbone, your survival chances decrease dramatically, because
  you get hit-listed.



  Consider further that this kind of aggressive action is necessary
  for Western leaders, because their backs are already against the
  wall. Their own constituents are fed-up to levels that haven’t
  been seen since the 1960s, with inequality growing daily. The
  largest political parties have already decided that they are in
  the game for themselves, with few differences to speak of between
  their policies. Thus, they only have two choices – continue going
  with whatever policies suit their wealthy campaign backers or do
  an about-face and start compromising with ‘the people’.



  Needless to say, that would burn the bridge with campaign
  financiers, and since that relationship has been ongoing for a
  very long time, taking the plunge to change things around seems
  like a pretty big risk. So no one does it, and they just continue
  doing what they’ve done for the last 20 years, which is to try to
  steamroll everything in their path.



  This is the real logic behind sanctions: an attempt to make the
  Russian leadership unpopular with its own businesses and citizens
  to the point that a more conciliatory party and leader are
  elected. No easy task, clearly, since imposing sanctions which
  exclusively hit Russia involves a fair bit of cherry-picking.



  Western politicians seem determined to follow this course to the
  bitter end rather than acknowledge that their own political
  interests may not be the only ones on Earth or that we might be
  under some sort of obligation to negotiate with the elected
  leaders of other nations.

Since the moment Ukraine chose to become an independent state, it has had to accept that it can’t develop as a country at the cost of Russian taxpayers, Anna Van Densky, political commentator from the EU Reporter Magazine, told RT.


  Speaking about Russian gas, Van Densky said that Europe needs it
  badly for its development, while this commodity is taken hostage
  because of the political contradictions and ambitions over
  Ukrainian crisis.


RT: Has the gas supply to Europe ever been
  as threatened as it is now?

Anna Van Densky: It has always been a problem
  like that because after the collapse of the Soviet Union it was
  very difficult for the Ukrainian leadership to come to the terms
  that independence has its own price and if Ukraine is an
  independent state. They have to pay for gas as for any other
  commodity. Now of course it’s not the first so-called gas war
  because, unfortunately, gas transit was used on many occasions as
  an instrument of political pressure.



  That what we see now, because now the supplies to Europe are also
  threatened, that’s why the South Stream corridor is so crucial to
  stabilize gas supplies to Europeans, because we had the situation
  with crisis in 2006, 2009. It’s a system that should be really
  reconstructed, rebuilt in another way, and that’s why it’s ideal
  for Ukrainians themselves also to have different view on the
  energy so that they could also open a broad gate to green energy,
  for example, alternative energy, wind energy, etc. So this
  dependency on transit of Russian gas is also unhealthy for the
  Ukrainian state, for Ukrainians, because unfortunately there were
  many parasites around this easy money.


RT:Is South Stream pipeline really
  necessary? Surely it would be cheaper to work out a proper, long
  term deal with Ukraine? What do you think?

AD: There are a lot of details that are very
  ambivalent. First of all, in any supplies it’s much better to
  have multiple ways than one way, so it’s not only for political
  reasons. There can be other reasons like a catastrophe. The
  problem of supply isn’t dependent on Ukrainians as such. [The]
  more routes, [the] more secure it is. That’s why you talk all the
  time about diversifying the ways of gas. South Stream is an ideal
  way because it goes from Russia through Black Sea and it comes to
  Bulgaria, it comes directly to the EU. So it’s one of the ways,
  it’s not about cutting gas, Russian gas, from [going] through
  Ukraine, it’s just diminishing this route and giving other
  alternative routes and opportunity. It’s also very fashionable
  because it will open real opportunities for the other alternative
  to Ukrainians, like green energy, for example.


RT: Ukraine still wants heavily discounted
  gas prices. Is that a fair request?

AD: It’s not a fair request, no. It comes from
  the Soviet era, because once upon a time Soviet Union was
  basically one state. Asking for this price is absolutely
  ridiculous in the situation of being an independent state and
  buying a commodity. It’s a confusion and this confusion caused a
  lot of political problems afterwards as well, because the moment
  Ukraine or Ukrainian people chose to become an independent state,
  they had to accept that they can’t develop their country on cost
  of Russian taxpayers, because they are the citizens of other

  So it’s a lot of political confusion now as well, because if
  Europeans would like to help Ukrainians they have to sit together
  with Russians at the negotiation table and find out the way to
  help them to pay their bills, because it would be very na?ve to
  expect that Russian taxpayers are obliged to finance Ukrainian
  integration into the EU.

  revolutions are very anti-democratic because now the decisions

  democratic elections there will be new leaders who will accept a

  energy supplier is now a hostage to Kiev's political whims? Is
  there any solution?

AD: The South Stream is an ideal solution
  basically because it goes from Russia through the Black Sea and
  to Europe. It will help Europe because European needs gas badly,
  for example, Italy wants to develop southern Italy, and it would
  be a great opportunity for the economies of the south to get
  Russian gas. Let’s not forget that gas remains the most
  ecological among all types of energy. So it’s good for Europe,
  it’s good for [the] economy and it’s very sad that such a
  commodity is taken hostage because of these political
  contradictions and ambitions.



  It’s especially important to have South Stream corridor as a
  solution to diversify the ways of gas to Europe. The latest
  Ukrainian Maidan revolution is not the first one, there was also
  the Orange Revolution and the hope was flying high, but it didn’t
  deliver it and it ended in a second revolution, Maidan. When the
  situation will be stabilizing in Ukraine nobody really knows. We
  hope it will be stabilized soon. Anyway, I think that European
  and Russians, the taxpayers from both sides can’t be taken
  hostage of this political instability in Ukraine, so the South
  Stream and Nord Stream, maybe other pipeline like Yamal, will
  help to create real strategic partnership and well-being of the
  people.

Since the moment Ukraine chose to become an independent state, it has had to accept that it can’t develop as a country at the cost of Russian taxpayers, Anna Van Densky, political commentator from the EU Reporter Magazine, told RT.


  Speaking about Russian gas, Van Densky said that Europe needs it
  badly for its development, while this commodity is taken hostage
  because of the political contradictions and ambitions over
  Ukrainian crisis.


RT: Has the gas supply to Europe ever been
  as threatened as it is now?

Anna Van Densky: It has always been a problem
  like that because after the collapse of the Soviet Union it was
  very difficult for the Ukrainian leadership to come to the terms
  that independence has its own price and if Ukraine is an
  independent state. They have to pay for gas as for any other
  commodity. Now of course it’s not the first so-called gas war
  because, unfortunately, gas transit was used on many occasions as
  an instrument of political pressure.



  That what we see now, because now the supplies to Europe are also
  threatened, that’s why the South Stream corridor is so crucial to
  stabilize gas supplies to Europeans, because we had the situation
  with crisis in 2006, 2009. It’s a system that should be really
  reconstructed, rebuilt in another way, and that’s why it’s ideal
  for Ukrainians themselves also to have different view on the
  energy so that they could also open a broad gate to green energy,
  for example, alternative energy, wind energy, etc. So this
  dependency on transit of Russian gas is also unhealthy for the
  Ukrainian state, for Ukrainians, because unfortunately there were
  many parasites around this easy money.


RT:Is South Stream pipeline really
  necessary? Surely it would be cheaper to work out a proper, long
  term deal with Ukraine? What do you think?

AD: There are a lot of details that are very
  ambivalent. First of all, in any supplies it’s much better to
  have multiple ways than one way, so it’s not only for political
  reasons. There can be other reasons like a catastrophe. The
  problem of supply isn’t dependent on Ukrainians as such. [The]
  more routes, [the] more secure it is. That’s why you talk all the
  time about diversifying the ways of gas. South Stream is an ideal
  way because it goes from Russia through Black Sea and it comes to
  Bulgaria, it comes directly to the EU. So it’s one of the ways,
  it’s not about cutting gas, Russian gas, from [going] through
  Ukraine, it’s just diminishing this route and giving other
  alternative routes and opportunity. It’s also very fashionable
  because it will open real opportunities for the other alternative
  to Ukrainians, like green energy, for example.


RT: Ukraine still wants heavily discounted
  gas prices. Is that a fair request?

AD: It’s not a fair request, no. It comes from
  the Soviet era, because once upon a time Soviet Union was
  basically one state. Asking for this price is absolutely
  ridiculous in the situation of being an independent state and
  buying a commodity. It’s a confusion and this confusion caused a
  lot of political problems afterwards as well, because the moment
  Ukraine or Ukrainian people chose to become an independent state,
  they had to accept that they can’t develop their country on cost
  of Russian taxpayers, because they are the citizens of other
  countries. That’s the way it goes.



  So it’s a lot of political confusion now as well, because if
  Europeans would like to help Ukrainians they have to sit together
  with Russians at the negotiation table and find out the way to
  help them to pay their bills, because it would be very na?ve to
  expect that Russian taxpayers are obliged to finance Ukrainian

“European history has demonstrated that Russia will not compromise when it believes that its security and independence are at stake,” Sobell said. “It is utterly baffling why the White House fails to grasp these realities and why it keeps on digging itself deeper into what is a very big hole,” he added.

On Monday, the US introduced new sanctions targeting seven individual Russians and 17 Russian companies in response to Crimea’s reunification with Russia, which the United States does not acknowledge, as well as Russia’s stance on Ukraine, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.

“At the contact group meeting in Geneva on April 17, 2014, Russia, Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union decided on a number of steps to deescalate the situation in eastern Ukraine, including refraining from further violence or provocative acts,” Carney said in a statement.

“Since April 17, Russia has done nothing to meet its Geneva commitments and in fact has further escalated the crisis. Russia’s involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable,” he said.

“By pushing for deeper sanctions, Washington risks exposing its impotence in the face of Russia’s determination to prevent Ukraine’s accession to NATO,” Vlad Sobell told RIA Novosti.

He added the US fails to understand that Russia’s political and security establishment “is bound to view Ukraine’s creeping accession to the alliance as the ultimate ‘red line’ and hence is ready to stall it at any price, including direct military confrontation with NATO.” “Against this background, Moscow will view any sanctions, however extensive, as a mere irritant,” Sobell said.

Moreover, the US and the EU appear to be divided in their views of further sanctions against Russia. The EU has a large trade turnover with Moscow and large European corporations are expected to lobby against the sanctions amid a fragile economic recovery. Sobell noted that Russia would be damaged by sanctions, yet “the balance sheet is far from clear.”

“First, Russia would turn elsewhere to replace business with the EU destroyed under the impact of the sanctions,” Sobell said. “Second, as many commentators have pointed out, the Kremlin may even welcome some aspects of the sanctions as a tool in its efforts to ‘de-offshorize’ the economy. And, finally, we should not underestimate the impact of the swelling patriotic sentiment resulting from Russia’s confrontation with the West,” he told RIA Novosti.

Sobell concluded that the US had embarked on a high-risk path – “far from buttressing the West’s unity and demonstrating the strength of the alliance, it risks exposing NATO as a ‘paper tiger.’”

Moscow has repeatedly warned that talking in the language of sanctions is “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warned its Western partners about the “boomerang effect” that sanctions would have.","MOSCOW, April 28 (RIA Novosti), Daria Chernyshova – The White House is merely digging itself deeper into a hole by imposing further sanctions against Russia, failing to grasp that Moscow will not compromise when national security is at stake, independent analyst and New York University professor Prague Vlad Sobell told RIA Novosti.

The Federation Council overwhelmingly approved the tighter controls on Russian blogs and websites that attract more than 3,000 daily visits, under legislation the government says is needed to formalize the definition of blogging in Russian law.

Opponents say the law will enable Putin to silence opponents who are rarely given air time on the mostly state-controlled or pro-Putin television channels, and have instead used the Internet to organize protests against the former KGB spy.

The new policy is to restrict free information exchange, restrict expression of opinion, be it in written text, speech or video. They want to restrict everything because they're headed towards the 'glorious past', Anton Nosik, a prominent Russian blogger and online media expert, told Reuters.

China is much more liberal than what Russia wants to achieve, he said, describing the move as unconstitutional.

The pressure group Reporters Without Borders (RWB) said the law was an attempt to increase control of online content.

The State Duma lower house has already backed the law and it now needs Putin's signature to go into force. Both chambers are dominated by the United Russia party loyal to the president.

The new rules will require popular bloggers to register by name with Russia's communications oversight agency and conform to regulations on the mass media.

The Kremlin denies allegations of censorship or pressure on the media and says Russians have the right to express their opinions and stage protests.

CIA PROJECT

But Putin has described the Internet as a CIA project and parliament has approved moves requiring social media websites to keep their servers in Russia and save information about users for at least six months.

With 61 million users, Russia is Europe's fastest-growing Internet audience, according to a 2013 report by industry body comScore, and blogs have been seen by Putin's opponents as one of the few popular platforms beyond the Kremlin's reach.

The editor of a popular Internet news site, Lenta.ru, was dismissed this year and independent TV Dozhd has gone off the air. The head of VKontakte, Russia's answer to Facebook, has been ousted and fled the country.

The government has also blocked access to the Internet sites of Kremlin critics Alexei Navalny and Garry Kasparov because they contained calls for illegal activity.

Navalny was one of the leaders of the anti-Putin protests of 2011-12, which were organized largely through social media sites and blogs. Navalny has further used his own blog to highlight state corruption and undermine United Russia in a campaign that helped establish him as an opposition leader.

Russia's leading blog platform, LiveJournal, appears to be standing up to the new rules.

The day after the blogging law was approved by the lower house, LiveJournal director Dmitry Pilipenko said the site would no longer display the number of subscribers a blog had if the figure exceeded 2,500.

Pilipenko said all coincidences are accidental but the timing of the announcement means many have seen the decision as a bid to protect LiveJournal's users. The decision followed a similar move by Russia's biggest search engine Yandex.

These steps will not stop Russia's media watchdog monitoring popular bloggers as it can obtain information on readership statistics independently, Roscomnadzor head Alexander Zharov said.

Amid a war of words between Washington and Moscow, the agreement reached in Geneva last week for resolving the crisis looks dead in the water. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of bad faith, and on the ground there is a growing sense of stalemate, interrupted by episodes of violence that only harden views.

Just one month before the Ukrainian presidential election, constitutional reforms that might mollify the pro-Russian protesters are still being thrashed out.

The Geneva agreement called on the protesters to relinquish the buildings they hold and promised amnesty for those who do. But the immediate answer from behind the barricades was defiant.

As one of the leaders of the occupation in Donetsk put it to CNN, We have not come this far just to leave without our demands being met. It is the Kiev government that is illegitimate. They have to give up the buildings they have seized. There was a similar response from protest leaders in the southern city of Mariupol.

So how might events in Ukraine unfold between now and the May 25 elections? Here are some of the scenarios that could play out, but events are moving swiftly and unpredictably.

Peace breaks out

The Geneva agreement offered what U.S. President Barack Obama called a glimmer of hope. But John Kerry, his top diplomat, cautioned after the talks: None of us leave here with the sense that the job is done because the words are on the paper.

The job of implementing the agreement has fallen to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) which already has about 100 monitors in eastern Ukraine and is tasked with negotiating the surrender of occupied buildings.

In Kerry's words, what is vital is that the OSCE needs to get to work immediately to de-escalate the security situation in Luhansk, in Donetsk, in Slavyansk and all the other towns that have been destabilized.

But the OSCE monitors have no powers of enforcement - and the visceral hatred of the pro-Russian groups for both the U.S. and Europe makes their task a daunting one. CNN met a team of observers in Slavyansk on Monday after they'd spent two hours with the self-declared mayor. They confined themselves to a brief statement that gave no indication of progress, and the Organization later acknowledged problems in gaining access to the town.

Put simply, the occupiers don't see themselves as behaving illegally. Denis Pushilin, who's become the political voice of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, turned the tables on Kiev, saying the government (or junta, as pro-Russian groups prefer to call it) had come to power through a coup and was itself illegally occupying public buildings. Pushilin insisted that plans for a local referendum on Donetsk's future -- organized by the protesters -- would proceed. We heard the same message in Slavyansk, Luhansk and Mariupol.

Much hinges on what sort of constitutional reform emerges. Kerry said Thursday that the Ukrainian government had gone to extraordinary lengths to address regional demands for more autonomy, for local self-government, for the protection of minority rights. Visiting Donetsk recently, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk promised far-reaching devolution to the regions, including greater control over their finances. But Russia wants more - a guarantee that Ukraine won't join NATO and direct elections in the regions to both legislative and executive office. One of the most centralized states on earth is demanding sweeping decentralization next door.

As William Partlett, a lecturer at Columbia University's School of Law, writes in the magazine Jurist: The 'framers' of the new Ukrainian constitution therefore are likely not to just be Ukrainians-and the bargaining is just as likely to take place in Geneva rather than Kiev.

The government's attitude toward a referendum has been ambivalent. Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov has said he is not against a national referendum on the country's form of government, perhaps in tandem with the presidential vote.

But the protesters say they will accept nothing less than a regional referendum that gives Donetsk and other eastern regions the option to secede from Ukraine. They have set up committees in Luhansk and Donetsk to plan a vote on May 11, though how it would be organized in an area with a population of more than 6.5 million people is open to question. Few of the protesters have any government experience: 32-year old Pushilin is a former security guard turned businessman and Irina Voropayeva, the spokeswoman in Mariupol, a housewife. And whether it would be seen as free and fair, without an independent election body or international observers, is questionable.

The irony is that several polls conducted by Ukrainian NGOs in recent months suggest the supporters of unification with Russia are in a minority. The Institute for Social Studies and Political Analysis in Donetsk reported in March that two-thirds of respondents were not in favor of joining Russia. But a majority also thought Ukraine was going in the wrong direction.

Ukraine's government recovers control of the east

On the evidence of the past few weeks, that seems very improbable. Pro-Russian groups control buildings from Slavyansk in the north to Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. They are often led by men in green, as the uniformed groups have become known. They are now the effective authority in swathes of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Local police have either vanished or cut a deal with them.

The army's first attempts to assert a presence in the east have been disastrous. South of Kramatorsk last Wednesday, CNN encountered a column of a dozen armored personnel carriers stranded either side of a railway line. Some 100 soldiers of the 25th Airborne Brigade, exhausted and dejected, were being harangued by local people, as the leader of a pro-Russian group negotiated terms for their release. Eventually they gave up much of their equipment and were allowed to leave, and the next day, Turchynov disbanded the unit. Six armored personnel carriers (APCs) from another unit were seized and paraded in Slavyansk.

CNN followed one military convoy of some 70 vehicles for two hours across a rural swathe of Donetsk region. Several of its vehicles broke down; most were of Soviet vintage and in poor repair. Stragglers were left behind. Morale seemed brittle at best.

Ukrainian police have been largely invisible as the crisis has unfolded. Riot police virtually surrounded a pro-Kiev rally in Donetsk to prevent clashes last week, but elsewhere local police have stepped aside whenever trouble has surfaced. At one roadblock, between Donetsk and Slavyansk, they have stood across the road as pro-Russian protesters check traffic.

Civil war

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Ukraine is on the brink of civil war, but it doesn't look like that. The pro-Russian protesters are often in dozens rather than hundreds and there is very little pro-Kiev sentiment on display. The pro-Kiev rally in Donetsk last week attracted about 1,000 people.

There have been no large rallies or street clashes. Traffic streams down Artyoma Street in Donetsk, oblivious or used to the barricades of tires and Russian flags outside the regional government building, and children play on swings within sight of the coils of razor-wire.

It seems many people here don't want to get involved. Some fear that they will be attacked if they show their colors. But the great majority are going about their daily business as normal, too preoccupied with making ends meet as the economy worsens and the value of the hryvna (Ukraine's currency) slides. It's down nearly 30% against the dollar this year. The last thing they want is violence.

Katerina, a young mother out with her son in a Donetsk park last Friday, expressed the exasperation felt by many here.

If my son asks me about what happened, we ourselves don't understand. Who is in power? Those people who are right? Or those who are not? she said.

In the countryside, life goes on slowly. Cows are led to pasture, elderly women sit on benches and gossip. The barricades seem a long way distant.

There is a risk that ultra-nationalists in Kiev - known as the Pravy Sektor or Right Sektor - will organize groups to confront the enemy in the east. Pro-Russian leaders in Slavyansk accused the group of being behind a shooting at a rural roadblock on Sunday, and paraded ID tags allegedly identifying the assailants as members of the Sektor.

Moscow chimed in, accusing Kiev of being unwilling to put in check and disarm nationalists and extremists. Right Sektor swiftly denied it had any members in the area, and the incident seemed to raise more questions than it answered. But a rash of such incidents, however caused, could bring Russian intervention closer.

A Russian invasion

Both Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have said repeatedly that Russia has no plans to invade or annex eastern Ukraine, despite the presence of some 40,000 Russian troops close to the border. Such an incursion would lead to far more stringent sanctions against Russia by the West; and the use of conventional forces in an occupation would be a dangerous and expensive move at a time when the Russian economy is stuttering. In any case, Russia's interests are already being served by the men in green, some of whom have come to eastern Ukraine from Russia, Crimea and Belarus, and who are chipping away at Kiev's authority in the region.

But should the Ukrainian government try to reassert its authority in the east or Ukrainian nationalists arrive in numbers, leading to casualties among the protesters, Moscow's calculations might change. It has consistently promised to protect Russian compatriots in Ukraine, and during his lengthy news conference last week said: I remind you that the Federation Council (the upper house of the Russian Duma) has given the president the right to use armed forces in Ukraine.

He also used the term Novorossiya to talk about parts of Ukraine -- a word used during the 1700s to describe the Tsarist expansion of Russia's borders southward to the Black Sea. To those in the former Soviet republics who believe Putin's ambition is to restore a Greater Russia, it was a telling moment.

Pro-Russian protesters in Ukraine call for Russian help on an almost daily basis, begging for protection from the fascists. The self-declared mayor of Slavyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, appealed to Putin directly Sunday, saying: If you can't send peace-keeping troops, please help with food, weapons, whatever you can. Our people are ready to fight to defend our land from the fascist invasion.

If these sporadic cries for help gather pace, with or without Moscow's encouragement, a full-scale Russian intervention cannot be discounted.

The messy status quo

To many observers, that seems the most likely scenario - a stand-off between Kiev and pro-Russian groups in the east. The young and largely inexperienced Ukrainian government has shown itself incapable of dealing with the pro-Russian groups, who in turn don't have (as yet) the muscle to turn protest into outright secession.

Ukrainian security forces even appear to be trying to lock in the contagion, with military and police checkpoints springing up on the borders between Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, and checkpoints around Donetsk city beefed up.

There is growing coordination between the protesters in different cities, and the small groups of unknown uniformed men have shown it doesn't take much to seize buildings that are largely unguarded. A CNN team observed several vehicles with masked men leaving Slavyansk on Monday; two hours later they were involved in the seizure of the police station in nearby Kramatorsk. But the pro-Russian protesters don't appear capable of governing. Many of those milling about the regional government building in Donetsk wearing balaclava masks are teenagers. No political leader has yet emerged as a figure with whom the government (or the OSCE) could negotiate.

The next steps will be the publication of a new draft constitution, and the May 11 vote organized by pro-Russian groups in the east. Turchynov, the acting President, insisted Tuesday that the majority of Ukrainian citizens are for a united unitary democratic Ukraine with greater powers given to the regions.

The Ukrainian government in Kiev has lost control of vast parts of its own country, with the east moving further and further apart, investigative journalist Manuel Ochsenreiter told RT, warning that a real civil war is possible.

RT:We’ve heard repeated calls from Russia
  and the West for there to be nationwide dialogue from Kiev, but
  given what has happened today, another administrative building
  has been taken over by protesters, how likely do you think it is
  that protesters will actually be willing to negotiate or
  talk?

Manuel Ochsenreiter: It’s very much unlikely
  that the protesters in eastern and southern Ukraine would talk on
  the same level with the putsch government in Kiev, because we
  have to realize that in the eyes of those protesters, the
  government in Kiev is a sort of gang of oligarchs, of organized
  crime, of terrorists, and of course hooligans, and when we see
  who is right now governing in Kiev, they are not so wrong. So who
  can expect or who can blame those people that they are not
  willing to talk with that government and that they want to take
  the fate of their people, the self determination of the Russians
  there, to take it in their own hands.


RT:So do we have a stalemate here? How do
  you see things playing out?

MO: We see now the violence has become more, but
  we also saw that the Kiev government doesn’t have control of its
  own country. The Ukrainian state, what we saw now on the map,
  when we put the map on the table, is not existing anymore; it is
  a failed state, an empty entity, which is in the west governed by
  a putsch gang of people who were imposed by the West, by NATO, as
  well as the European Union. Not with the support of their people
  but with the support of foreign powers, with the support of the
  West, while the people in the east and in the south are spreading
  away from Kiev and they want to merge with Russia in any form. So
  if there is no opportunity for that, that both parts of Ukraine
  can talk with each other and that they will find a solution that
  pleases both sides, there will be much more violence and it can
  be very likely that a real civil war might break out. And this
  would not be not a civil war like in Syria, far away from Europe.
  This would be a civil war inside Europe.


RT:The protesters in east Ukraine are
  saying they want to hold a referendum. They want to do it before
  the election at the end of this month. Presumably, this is not
  advisable. How do you see best to deal with this issue of the
  referendum?

MO: When you ask me if this is advisable, it
  depends on who you ask. First of all, it is not the West, it is
  not Brussels, and it is not Washington. It is not Berlin, it is
  not Paris, and it is not London, who decides what is advisable
  for the eastern Ukrainians. If they want to hold a referendum and
  they want to give themselves a decision where to go, the fate of
  the future, they should do that. It is always the wrong image
  that we have that people should ask in Washington or in Brussels
  if they are allowed to do a thing like a referendum. We had that
  already with Crimea, when the West was protesting, but thank God
  we have to say that we enter now a new period of history, where a
  geopolitical earthquake takes place and we see that we don’t have
  anymore the situation that the term “international community” is
  a camouflage word for the West. The international community means
  there are multiple levels; there are a lot of states. And of
  course, if they want to do a referendum and they want to do a
  decision, it is also important what Moscow says...it is important
  what China says, what the BRICS states are saying. It is not just
  anymore important what NATO is saying and what Washington is
  saying. And that is why this is a very good development.


RT:But there is a big difference between
  the referendum that took place in Crimea, and just geographically
  speaking, the one that will take place in eastern Ukraine. There
  are two very different problems, but presumably the one in east
  Ukraine could be a lot worse in terms of what could happen, what
  the consequences could be.

MO: Absolutely. The situation of the referendum
  is very much different. In Crimea it was very calm, almost like a
  typical election day somewhere in a little sleepy European city.
  But what we expect now, of course, in eastern Ukraine is
  something else. And we will see there a lot of violence, we will
  see there maybe bomb attacks. We know that there are terrorists
  working for the Kiev government. I mean we have the Right Sector
  group, which is nothing else than a hooligan and a terrorist
  group. There are people of the Right Sector fighting with
  Chechnya’s Islamists against Russia. They were fighting in the
  Georgian war in 2008. So we have to expect of course when we look
  at the borderline that it is very easy to infiltrate eastern
  Ukraine. Much more easy to infiltrate eastern Ukraine from Kiev
  than it was to infiltrate, for example, Crimea. Of course the
  situation is different, but at the end of the day it is still a
  referendum. And maybe somebody can tell me a more basic
  democratic act than a referendum, when the people have the right
  to show their voice for what they want to do in the future.


RT:Just last night, we saw military drills
  taking place in Kiev. The Kiev authorities deny they had anything
  to do with this. What is your interpretation of what went
  on?

MO: The Kiev government, if we can call that a
  government, they have two problems. Problem number one: they lost
  complete control of vast areas of their own country, what I said
  [before], that the country just exists on the map. And on the
  other side, they are working with many dirty tricks because they
  desperately want to have military and economic support of the
  West, mainly NATO and the EU. For any provocation they do, they
  want to provoke the Russians to show military action. We know
  that Poland is very much putting fuel into that fire, the Baltic
  states as well. They are already promising Ukraine their support.
  So there is something going on and of course the Kiev government
  is desperately trying to get that support.

Russian military aircraft have not breached any state borders, including those of Ukraine, Russia’s Defense Ministry has said. Ukraine’s acting defense minister has also retracted claims by Kiev that Russian jets “violated Ukrainian airspace seven times.”

“Russia’s means of objective airspace situation control did
  not record any violations of air boundaries of the states
  adjacent to Russia, including those of Ukraine,” Russian
  Defense Ministry said in a statement Saturday.



  Pentagon officials quoted by US media Friday claimed that
  “Russian fighter jets flew into Ukrainian airspace a handful
  of times over the last 24 hours,” calling it “a
  continued provocation.” The officials were not named.
  “The unfounded claims of Pentagon officials on the alleged
  ‘breaching of airspace of Ukraine by Russian fighter jets’
  appears to have been based on rumors and speculation,” a
  Russian Defense Ministry spokesman told Itar-Tass on Saturday.


“Those media allegations are populist in nature, they contain
  no information on the time and place of the incident, as well as
  no data on altitude, speed and the direction of aircraft, as well
  as no other objective parameters,” the spokesman said.
  
  The US sources must have “dreamed it all up,” or “a
  little bird told them that,” the spokesman added.



  The Defense Ministry spokesman called on Pentagon officials to
  stop “spreading unverified ‘facts’ through the media,”
  saying that “it does not at all help de-escalate the
  situation in Ukraine.”


  Instead, the US Defense Department should “use the many
  years’ experience of cooperation on information interchange”
  with the Russian side.



  The Ukrainian coup-imposed acting defense minister, Mikhail
  Koval, on Saturday told journalists that no violations of state
  borders by the Russian aircraft or troops have been recorded.
  “Four [Russian] transport airplanes Il-76 were flying along
  our state border but they did not cross the borderline,”
  Koval was quoted as saying by Interfax-Ukraine.



  The “peak of activity” of the Russian Armed Forces
  conducting military exercises near the Ukrainian border
  was recorded on April 24-25, he said. The closest that the
  Russian troops came to the Ukrainian border was 2-3 kilometers,
  Koval said.
  
  According to the Ukrainian official, the Russian drills were
  meant to discourage Kiev from continuing with the so-called
  “anti-terrorist operation” in three southeastern regions
  of Ukraine. However, he added, the military operation continues
  “although its pace is not high.”


  Koval’s statements, made during the Saturday briefing, apparently
  contradicted the allegations earlier made by the Kiev government
  against Russia.

Ukraine’s growing gas debt may lead to the failure of the country’s transit obligations and the reduction of gas supplies to south-eastern Europe, said the Russian Energy Ministry.


  Officials from Russia, including Energy Minister Alexander Novak
  and Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, and officials from
  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Moldova held talks in Moscow on
  Saturday.
  
  The meeting, also attended by officials from the Russian Ministry
  of Economic Development and the Finance Ministry, was held in the
  form of consultations on the security of gas transit through
  Ukraine.
  
  All sides expressed deep concern about Ukraine’s growing debt,
  Novak told journalists.
  “Currently Ukraine’s debt is US$2.238 billion, this [figure]
  does not include gas deliveries made in April,” Novak noted.
  “The debt will rise 1.3 billion for the April
  deliveries.”
  Ukraine’s debt may lead to a situation where not enough gas will
  be pumped into Ukrainian underground storage facilities, which
  may create the risk of non-performance by Ukraine of its transit
  obligations and of undersupply of gas to Southeastern Europe, the
  ministry said.
  
  In turn the parties discussed the importance of gas
  transportation projects designed to reduce transit risks for
  European consumers, primarily the South Stream project.
  “Today, only the South Stream project can give Europe real
  additional guarantees of energy security, said Miller on
  Friday.
  
  Russia also discussed with the participants the efforts to
  organize negotiations with the European Commission and Ukraine on
  how to deal with Kiev's failure to pay for gas.
  
  Novak said that the talks on the IMF stabilization loan will soon
  be held. The use of a portion of the IMF loan to repay the debt
  for previous gas supplies will be discussed there he added.



  Russia said it hopes the EU “will take measures towards the
  speediest disbursement of financial aid to Ukraine by European
  financial institutions, which will be used, among other things,
  for ensuring Naftogaz of Ukraine's timely payments for natural
  gas supplies from Gazprom, the ministry said.
  
  The ministry believes this will help to prevent unauthorized
  siphoning of gas from transit in Ukraine and strengthen Europe's
  energy security.



  Gazprom’s $45 billion South Stream project is due to partially

Then, at a second checkpoint, the car was stopped, and flak jackets and personal belongings were taken from passengers, she said. They were transferred to another car, taken to a new location -- where they saw another group of journalists being escorted -- and then blindfolded and taken to a different location.

Russian Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov said there were no politics behind possible decisions to ban some supplies to Russia from some or other countries.

It is usual. It is just presented as something extraordinary due to the politicization of the situation around Ukraine, he said, commenting on the reports about a possible ban on supplies of fruit and vegetables from Poland.

The minister noted that the federal service for veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance and the federal service for supervision of consumer rights protection and human welfare previously regularly imposed bans because of detection of some diseases or phytosanitary, quarantine or other problems.

Fyodorov also assured that there would be no shortage of food products in Russia. The Russian Agriculture Ministry rules out any possibility of shortages of some food products because of restrictions or sanctions, he told reporters in reply to a question about consequences of possible restrictions on supplies to Russia from some countries.

Practically always there are alternative countries and alternative regions that can promptly begin to supply needed products, he said.

Besides, a position of farmers in Western countries is far from always being the same as that of their governments. The United States is unwilling now to be a friend of Russia, but US producers of poultry, pork and beef ask for access to the Russian market, the minister notes, adding that the influence of farmers in the United States is rather strong. There are more than six million voters only, and with family members there are tens of millions of voters. It is a very influential force in Europe and the US. So, we will work, if not with the administrations (of the countries), then with farmers of France, the Netherlands and Canada, he added.

New U.S. and EU sanctions packages, announced with fanfare, were seen as so mild that Russian share prices rose in relief. A small number of names were added to existing blacklists, while threats to take more serious measures were put on hold.

Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded by threatening to reconsider Western participation in energy deals in Russia, the world's biggest oil producer, where most major U.S. and European oil companies have extensive projects.

Demonstrators smashed their way into the provincial government headquarters in Luhansk, Ukraine's easternmost province, which abuts the Russian border, and raised separatist flags over the building, while police did nothing to interfere.

As night fell, about 20 rebel gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons and threw stun grenades at the headquarters of the region's police, trying to force those inside to surrender their weapons, a Reuters photographer at the scene said.

The regional leadership does not control its police force, said Stanislav Rechynsky, an aide to Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, referring to events in Luhansk. The local police did nothing.

The rebels also seized the prosecutor's office and the television center.

The separatist operation in Luhansk appears to give the pro-Moscow rebels control of a second provincial capital. They already control much of neighboring Donetsk province, where they have proclaimed an independent People's Republic of Donetsk and declared a referendum on secession for May 11.

The rebels include local youths armed with clubs and chains, as well as green men - heavily armed masked men in military uniforms without insignia.

Adding control of Luhansk would give them sway over the entire Donbass coalfield - an unbroken swath of territory adjacent to Russia - where giant steel smelters and heavy plants account for around a third of Ukraine's industrial output.

It is the heart of a region that Putin described earlier this month as New Russia, reviving a term from when the tsars conquered it in the 18th and 19th centuries. Most people who live in the area now identify themselves as Ukrainians but speak Russian as their first language.

MOSCOW ACCUSED

Ukraine, a country of 45 million people the size of France, has a thousand-year history as a state but has spent much of the last few centuries under the shadow of its larger neighbor. It emerged as a modern independent nation after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, with borders drawn up by Bolshevik commissars from territory previously ruled by Russia, Poland and Austria.

Its current crisis erupted after a pro-Russian president was toppled in February in a popular uprising. Within days, Putin had declared the right to use military force and dispatched his undercover troops to seize Crimea.

The United States and European Union accuse Moscow of directing the uprising with the intent of dismembering Ukraine.

Today, Russia seeks to change the security landscape of eastern and central Europe, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a speech on Tuesday. Whatever path Russia chooses, the United States and our allies will stand together in our defense of Ukraine.

Nevertheless, U.S. and European officials have repeatedly made clear they will not consider military action.

The U.S. embassy in Kiev described the behavior of pro-Russian activists - who also attacked a rally of Kiev supporters on Monday with clubs and iron bars, and are holding dozens of hostages including seven unarmed European military monitors - as terrorism, pure and simple.

U.S. President Barack Obama, announcing new sanctions on Monday, said they were intended to change Putin's calculus.

But so far they have shown no sign of restraining the Kremlin leader, who overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy last month to seize and annex Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula and has since massed tens of thousands of troops on the frontier. Russia has openly threatened to invade to protect Russian speakers, though it denies that it plans to do so.

Putin threatened on Tuesday to review the role of Western firms in Russian energy deals.

We would very much wish not to resort to any measures in response. I hope we won't get to that point, Putin told reporters after meeting leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan.

But if something like that continues, we will of course have to think about who is working in the key sectors of the Russian economy, including the energy sector, and how.

Russia's RTS stock index rose 1.23 percent on Tuesday in relief that the latest EU and U.S. sanctions were so modest.

BLACKLISTS

After Russia took Crimea in March, Washington and Brussels each drew up sanctions blacklists that ban travel by and freeze the assets of individuals and firms deemed to have played a role in threatening Ukraine. The EU added 15 Russians and pro-Russian Ukrainians to its blacklist on Tuesday, a day after Washington added seven individuals and 17 firms to its own list.

But neither list includes any of Russia's major firms.

The latest U.S. list names Igor Sechin, a long-time Putin ally who now heads Russia's biggest oil company, Rosneft. But the firm said the blacklisting of its boss would not affect its operations, including plans to buy the oil trading arm of Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley.

Sechin's name was conspicuously left off the EU list. European countries do more than 10 times as much trade with Russia as the United States, buying a quarter of their natural gas from Moscow. They have been slower than Washington to embrace sanctions that might jeopardize trade.

Moscow has shrugged off the blacklists as pointless, though Washington and Brussels say they have had an indirect economic impact by scaring investors into withdrawing capital.

You have to look over the period of time Russia went into Crimea; since we've imposed sanctions, there has been a quite substantial deterioration in Russia's already weak economy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told congressional hearings.

We see it in their stock exchange, we see it in their exchange rate, we see it in a number of important economic indicators.

Lew said Washington could also impose wider sanctions on Russian industry. Obama said on Monday Western countries were keeping that option in reserve in case of further escalation.

A hostage drama has kept the issue on the boil in European capitals. On Friday, rebels captured eight unarmed European military monitors. A Swede was freed three days later, but four Germans, a Dane, a Czech and a Pole are still held in Slaviansk, a town rebels have turned into a heavily fortified redoubt.

The self-declared people's mayor of the town, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said on Tuesday he would discuss their release only if the EU dropped sanctions against rebel leaders.

If they fail to remove the sanctions, then we will block access for EU representatives, and they won't be able to get to us. I will remind my guests from the OSCE about this, he said, referring to the European hostages. Nevertheless, he later met OSCE representatives and said they had made good progress in discussions on the release of the captives.

Ukraine's authorities are struggling to find a way to evict the separatists, who also took a small town hall in Pervomaisk in the Luhansk region on Tuesday and a number of buildings in another city on Monday. Kiev launched an anti-terrorist operation in early April, but it has yielded little so far.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said the EU sanctions would not ease tensions in Ukraine.

Instead of forcing the Kiev clique to sit at the table with southeastern Ukraine to negotiate the future structure of the country, our partners are doing Washington's bidding with new unfriendly gestures aimed at Russia, the ministry said.

Gennady Kernes, the mayor of eastern Ukraine's biggest city, Kharkiv, was in a stable condition on Tuesday in a hospital in Israel, where he was flown after an assassination attempt. Kernes was shot in the back on Monday.

I would like to remind you that what was called Novorossiya back in the tsarist days – Kharkov, Lugansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Nikolayev and Odessa – were not part of Ukraine back then, Putin said. The center of that territory was Novorossiysk, so the region is called Novorossiya. Russia lost these territories for various reasons, but the people remained.

Putin's comment might be taken as it was portrayed – as an aside, or a little tidbit of information – if it weren't for the fact that Novorossiya has been brought up so often in recent days by pro-Russian activists, who have reportedly been chanting the word as they argued against staying with Kiev. Someone has even set up a Web site that appears devoted to bringing the historical region back.

If nothing else, Putin's comments are relatively accurate, historically: Novorossiya was won from the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century. Its name, which means New Russia, is a reflection of that. It became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in the early years of the Soviet Union, and remained a part of Ukraine after the collapse of communism.

Talking about Novorossiya fits in with Putin's broader habit of talking about a golden era of Russian empire, and using history to justify modern action. It's a similar action Putin made with Crimea, though in this case, the historical justification is a little harder to make: Crimea only became part of Ukraine in 1954, and you have to wonder what's to stop Turkey from deciding that its own claims on Novorossiya, earlier still than Russia's, are more valid?

In the modern world, things are more complicated. As the map below to the left shows, Crimea's large ethnic Russian population is not matched in any of the regions that once made up Novorossiya. However, as you can see from the map on the right, it makes up a big portion of the GDP of Ukraine.

It's not clear right now whether Putin has any real plan to annex Novorossiya, or whether it is just talk. But if Putin is hoping to foment chaos in Ukraine, it would appear that Crimea has shown him that history can be potent weapon.","During an epic question-and-answer session with the Russian public Thursday, President Vladimir Putin dropped a reference that is likely to be obscure to many in the West. Talking about the Ukrainian elections and ethnic Russians in that country's east, Putin took a detour through history.

Member-states of the EU have not ironed out disagreement on a further expansion of sanctions against Russia, a diplomat accredited with the mission of an East-European country told Itar-Tass Wednesday.

“A number of member-states have apprehensions regarding the reversibility of financial economic sanctions against Russia, should any such sanctions be endorsed,” the diplomat said commenting on a conference of EU ambassadors in Brussels around the situation in Ukraine.

The diplomat said the issue of a third phase of sanctions (financial and economic ones targeting whole sectors of Russian economy) will be put up for discussion at a session of EU Foreign Ministers who are due to get together in Brussels May 12.

State corporations have been advised to send their staff on vacations to Russian resorts, and President Vladimir Putin has told reporters that in his view private Russian companies should follow suit.


  The president was speaking at a media forum in St Petersburg
  organized by the United People’s Front – a relatively new
  political movement uniting those who support Putin’s ideas but
  choose not to join the United Russia party.



  Answering a question about recent rumors of bans on foreign
  vacations by various ministries and state-owned companies, Putin
  said that there were certain steps in this direction, but they
  were not restrictive. “As far as the companies with state
  participation are concerned, we have already sent them our
  recommendations on how they could organize holidays for their
  employees in our domestic resorts,” the Russian leader said.
  He also noted that private Russian companies also should not shun
  the domestic resorts: “We should direct our companies towards
  sending their staff and their children to our health spas.”



  “A lot has been done for this in Sochi, tens of billions of
  rubles were invested in the infrastructure, in construction of
  hotels - both the high class and ordinary, but attractively
  priced and of high quality,” the head of state told
  reporters.



  Earlier this week several Russian newspapers quoted unnamed
  sources in the Defence Ministry, Interior Ministry and several
  state law enforcement agencies as saying that there was a ban on
  employees going on vacations abroad.



  Russian officials quickly dismissed these reports as untrue, but
  some details emerged from the subsequent explanations.



  Nikolai Partrushev who heads Russia’s Security Council said that
  no travel bans had been imposed in any government department. The
  official added, however, that such restrictions had been pondered
  but only for those who had access to state secrets.



  The Federal Drug Control agency said that its directors only
  asked staff to pay attention to a recent release in which the
  Foreign Ministry asked Russian citizens who suspected that they
  could have conflicts with US justice to abstain from travelling
  to countries that have valid extradition agreements with the
  United States.



  The Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source in the Interior
  Ministry as saying that the ban existed, but it was classified
  and only concerned officers with high security clearance.","Authorities advise state companies to send employees to Russian resorts - Putin

William James Vahey killed himself in Luverne, Minnesota, last month, two days after a federal judge in Houston said authorities could search one of Vahey's thumb drives that allegedly contained images depicting sexual assault on children, CNN affiliate KPRC reported.

There were images of at least 90 victims, dating back to 2008, and the FBI is encouraging additional alleged victims to come forward. The images on the thumb drive allegedly belonging to Vahey showed boys, estimated to be between 12 and 14 years old, asleep or unconscious, the agency said.

The images had captions and dates referencing places that Vahey had previously traveled with students, the FBI said.

This is one of the most prolific alleged predators we've ever seen, Houston FBI Special Agent Shauna Dunlap told the station.

Vahey began teaching in private schools in 1972, the FBI says. He last taught at the American Nicaraguan School in Pista Suburbana, Managua, Nicaragua from August 2013 until March 11, two days before he committed suicide, KPRC reported.

The case came to law enforcement attention after Vahey fired his maid for allegedly stealing personal items from his home last year, KPRC said. In March, the ex-maid brought a stolen thumb drive to the American Nicaraguan School, saying she came forward because the drive contained sexual images, the station reported.

The FBI said that when Vahey was confronted with the images, he reportedly admitted molesting boys throughout his entire life and said he gave the minors sleeping pills prior to the molestation.

He had residences in London and Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and traveled extensively, the FBI said. He worked at schools in nine countries, teaching a variety of subjects and coaching boys' basketball. He regularly accompanied students on overnight field trips, the FBI said.

The schools where he taught are, according to the FBI:

-- American Nicaraguan School in Managua, Nicaragua (2013-2014)

-- Southbank International School in London, United Kingdom (2009-2013)

-- Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas, Venezuela (2002-2009)

Who supports sanctions against Russia

Seven leading industrialized states threatened Russia with further sanctions with regard to the situation around Ukraine. This says a G7 statement issued by the White House April 25.

Governments of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Great Britain and USA, as well as the European Union and the European Commission warned that they would not hesitate to impose additional sanctions against Russia.

The authors of the statement believe that “Russia is not taking any concrete steps to support the Geneva agreement” and “does not condemn separatists seeking to destabilize the situation in Ukraine”. Moscow is also accused of holding “threatening military drills near the Ukrainian border”.

The EU Council plans to adopt a regulation on expanding the black list for Russia until Monday evening. The list, which includes so far 33 names, may be completed by another 10-15 names of Russian officials and defense agencies’ representatives. All of them are banned entry to EU countries, and possible assets on EU territory are frozen.

Ambassadors of 28 members states of the EU also plan to discuss trade and economic sanctions against Russia. However, as a diplomatic source told ITAR-TASS earlier, there is no unity among the EU states on the appropriate economic measures against Russia, nor is there any consensus on the necessity to introduce them.

Who is against anti-Russian sanctions

Representatives of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which is in the ruling coalition, believe that the possible introduction of further sanctions against Russia would not be an effective instrument in settling the Ukrainian crisis.

The politician says that neither the increased NATO activity on eastern borders would yield any result. Sch?fer specified that federalization supporters in Ukraine “are by no means impressed by military exercises of 500 NATO servicemen in Poland”.

German Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who also represents SPD, has repeatedly pointed earlier to the necessity to seek for diplomatic ways of resolving the crisis in Ukraine. In particular, he called for holding “round tables” with participation of Kiev authorities and federalization supporters. In addition, the minister believes that representatives of Russia, USA, EU and Ukraine should in a four-party format “make joint trips to the country’s west and east” to hold a direct dialogue with the parties of the conflict.

German experts share the view that possible economic sanctions would have a negative impact primarily on German economy itself. Trade volume between Germany and Russia in 2013 amounted to ˆ76 billion, about 6,000 Germany-based enterprises are making business with Russian companies, and the total volume of their investments makes ˆ20 billion.

Eastern Ukrainians enraged by the Kiev military operation have used an RT video report to tell first-hand details of a Ukrainian army attack in Slavyansk. The Ukrainian troops raided a checkpoint and took all the food and medicine, they said.


  Ukraine-based British journalist Graham Phillips was making a
  video report for RT on Thursday right after Ukrainian armed
  forces stormed a checkpoint near Slavyansk and were withdrawing
  from the area.



  As Phillips was telling of the volatile situation in the
  background and reports of fatalities in the shootout, two locals
  approached his camera to have their say on what happened at the
  scene.


“Those who just left the checkpoint are f******
  jackals,” an angry man shouted, pointing in the direction of
  the retreating Ukrainian troops.


“They robbed us – they took our food, medicines, they just
  looted the place!” he said.



  Another man intervened, addressing the coup-imposed acting
  Ukrainian President Aleksandr Turchinov, who ordered the
  so-called “anti-terrorist operation” to resume in
  eastern Ukraine on Wednesday: “Turchinov feed them, will
  you?!”

“Turchinov, what the f***? Feed them, you motherf*****!”
  the first man chimed in.



  This is not the first time reports from Ukraine hint at the poor
  state of the Ukrainian army, which has been sent to the
  south-east of the country to quell the anti-government protests.
  While Slavyansk activists told RT young soldiers were sent to
  shoot at them with no food supplies, some of the Ukrainian
  soldiers who surrendered to the locals told RIA Novosti they had
  to eat “a nettle soup,” which they gathered on the
  roadside.



  Other video reports coming from Slavyansk on Thursday told a
  similar story to the men interrupting Phillips.

  Several Ukrainian troops “put a number of locals face down on
  the ground although they had no weapons whatsoever, after that
  the military drove away the rest and seized all the food from the
  checkpoint that was brought by the people to the fellows standing
  guard,” said a witness speaking to local activists on camera.



  He added that one young activist was shot dead and another
  injured at a nearby checkpoint overnight. Both activists were

Eastern Ukrainians enraged by the Kiev military operation have used an RT video report to tell first-hand details of a Ukrainian army attack in Slavyansk. The Ukrainian troops raided a checkpoint and took all the food and medicine, they said.


  Ukraine-based British journalist Graham Phillips was making a
  video report for RT on Thursday right after Ukrainian armed
  forces stormed a checkpoint near Slavyansk and were withdrawing
  from the area.



  As Phillips was telling of the volatile situation in the
  background and reports of fatalities in the shootout, two locals
  approached his camera to have their say on what happened at the
  scene.


“Those who just left the checkpoint are f******
  jackals,” an angry man shouted, pointing in the direction of
  the retreating Ukrainian troops.


“They robbed us – they took our food, medicines, they just
  looted the place!” he said.



  Another man intervened, addressing the coup-imposed acting
  Ukrainian President Aleksandr Turchinov, who ordered the
  so-called “anti-terrorist operation” to resume in
  eastern Ukraine on Wednesday: “Turchinov feed them, will
  you?!”

“Turchinov, what the f***? Feed them, you motherf*****!”
  the first man chimed in.



  This is not the first time reports from Ukraine hint at the poor
  state of the Ukrainian army, which has been sent to the
  south-east of the country to quell the anti-government protests.
  While Slavyansk activists told RT young soldiers were sent to
  shoot at them with no food supplies, some of the Ukrainian
  soldiers who surrendered to the locals told RIA Novosti they had
  to eat “a nettle soup,” which they gathered on the
  roadside.



  Other video reports coming from Slavyansk on Thursday told a
  similar story to the men interrupting Phillips.

  Several Ukrainian troops “put a number of locals face down on
  the ground although they had no weapons whatsoever, after that
  the military drove away the rest and seized all the food from the
  checkpoint that was brought by the people to the fellows standing
  guard,” said a witness speaking to local activists on camera.



  He added that one young activist was shot dead and another
  injured at a nearby checkpoint overnight. Both activists were
  unarmed, he said, calling the incident an “abuse” of
  Ukrainian troops’ duties.



  The activists reporting from the barricades said the raided
  checkpoints are now being reinforced with concrete blocks and
  that the self-defense troops are bracing for a looming attack.

As Ukraine’s new authorities unleash heavy weaponry on Slavyansk, blockading civilians in the town, the EU says it is “concerned” and has called on pro-autonomy protesters to end their “illegal actions.”


  The European Union, a fierce supporter of Kiev’s new authorities,
  said it is watching the events unfold in eastern Ukraine.
  We are following with growing concern the events in eastern
  Ukraine, Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for EU foreign
  policy chief Catherine Ashton, told reporters.
  
  Kiev has intensified its military operation in eastern Ukraine,
  with the army surrounding the anti-government stronghold of
  Slavyansk, blockading civilians inside with military helicopters
  and APCs on Friday morning. Two pilots have died, and
  self-defense forces in Slavyansk said that one of their members
  was killed.
  
  The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
  has urged for the creation of humanitarian corridors for the
  civilian population, Andrey Kelin, Russia's permanent
  representative to the organization, told RIA Novosti.
  
  While Kiev has chosen the path of military strikes, the EU has
  called on anti-government activists and self-defense forces –
  which have occupied government buildings in the city – to end
  “illegal actions.”Occupied buildings need to be vacated, all persons illegally
  detained need to be released, including the OSCE military
  observers, Kocijancic said.



  In February, as events unfolded at Kiev's Independence Square,
  the EU spoke in a heightened rhetoric, “condemning the
  violence” at the EuroMaidan protests.



  Anti-government Maidan protesters threw stones at police as
  officers responded with tear gas and stun grenades. The violence
  resulted in many casualties. European Union foreign policy chief
  Catherine Ashton responded to the events in a February statement,
  saying she “condemns all use of violence,including against
  public or party buildings” and urged the country’s political
  leadership to resolve the crisis.



  Regarding the Slavyansk military operation, Moscow now states
  that Kiev’s offensive has destroyed the last vestige of hope for
  implementing the Geneva agreement on de-escalating the Ukrainian
  crisis.
  While Russia is making efforts to de-escalate and resolve
  the conflict, the Kiev regime has chosen military aviation
  strikes on peaceful residential areas and started a punitive
  operation, literally destroying the last hope for the viability
  of the Geneva accords,” President Vladimir Putin’s
  spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday in response to the
  military’s advancement.



  Russia, the US, the EU, and Ukraine adopted a joint document on
  the de-escalation of the Ukraine crisis after talks in Geneva on
  April 17. One of the key points of the deal was the decision to
  refrain from any violence.



  During a UN Security Council meeting in New York at the end of
  April, Russia’s envoy to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said that Kiev
  had not taken any steps towards fulfilling the Geneva agreements.
  He also stressed that repressions against those disagreeing with
  Kiev’s coup-imposed authorities were continuing.
  
  Investigative journalist Pepe Escobar told RT that the activists
  in eastern Ukraine are not pro-Russian and merely want to be more
  independent from the coup-imposed government, with which they
  disagree.
  “They are not pro-Russian, they want a united Ukraine, a
  federalized Ukraine, a Finlandized Ukraine that is not allied
  with the EU and NATO or with Russia; it’s equidistant. And they
  want more autonomy in the eastern and southern provinces. This is
  what those 'militants' want in fact. And now they are being
  confronted by guns.”
  
  He added that sooner or later, the “Ukrainian neo-Nazi,

“This is a case of complete negligence of nuclear security requirements. I think that Ukrainian authorities will never take this step because their experts won’t let them,” said professor Boris Kalinin, the head of the materials science department at Moscow Engineering Physics Institute.

“The only fact the Americans made references to was that the fighters (in eastern Ukraine - Itar-Tass) was the people there were using the weapons of Russian manufacture but everyone in Ukraine uses Russian weaponry, for instance the Kalashnikov assault rifle or the Makarov handgun,” Lavrov said. “This means a proof of this sort can scarcely be called sufficient.”

He also said reports had come several days ago on discovery of a cache with U.S. weaponry in Ukraine, adding: “This should necessarily be investigated.”

Lavrov recalled that the Russian side had raised the problem during contacts with U.S. counterparts.

“Some reports said several hundred specialists from the private military company Greystone had arrived Ukraine from the U.S.,” he said. “Also, reports said foreigners had been involved in several accidents.”

“Americans told us they didn’t have any information on this and then they said they had referred the question directly to Greystone and the organization had denied any involvement on its part.’

“Still we’d like to know who is doing certain things because there are too many deflections of reality otherwise if you use the language of diplomacy,” Lavrov said.",341

S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade talks.

Obama, speaking at the summit with Abe, commented the U.S.- Japan alliance as the foundation for not only the U.S. security in Asia-Pacific region, but also for the region as a whole.

As to the TPP, Obama said in the joint press conference that the free trade talks should benefit the U.S. consumers and companies, adding the two countries are closer to deal on market access in TPP.

The president, however, said that limited access to Japanese market must be addressed under TPP.

For his part, Abe said that the two sides have agreed to seek an early conclusion of the TPP free trade talks and they would release a statement after ministerial talks on TPP later the day.

Abe said that the two leaders' summit has vitalized the Japan-U. S. alliance and they will expand cooperation in the defense area.

The two countries also agreed to work together to deal with nuclear and missile issues of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Thousands of trade unionists marched with Russian flags and flags of Putin's ruling United Russia party onto the giant square beneath the Kremlin walls, past the red granite mausoleum of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin.

Many banners displayed traditional slogans for the annual workers' holiday, like: Peace, Labour, May. But others were more directly political, alluding to the crisis in neighboring former Soviet republic Ukraine, where Russian troops seized and annexed the Crimea peninsula in March, precipitating the biggest confrontation with the West since the Cold War.

I am proud of my country, read one. Putin is right, said another.

Unlike Kremlin leaders in Soviet times, Putin did not personally preside at the parade from atop the mausoleum. But he carried out another Soviet-era tradition by awarding Hero of Labour medals to five workers at a ceremony in the Kremlin. He revived the Stalin-era award a year ago.

Putin has described the breakup of the Soviet Union as a tragedy and overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy in March by declaring Russia's right to intervene in former Soviet countries to protect Russian speakers.

Laws have been changed to make it easier for Russia to annex territory from other former Soviet states and for inhabitants of other parts of the old Soviet Union to get Russian citizenship.

Since the annexation of Crimea, pro-Moscow gunmen have seized territory in eastern Ukraine and Putin has massed tens of thousands of troops on the frontier. He denies he is planning an invasion but proclaims the right to launch one if necessary to defend Russian speakers.

May Day, always an important date in the Soviet calendar and still a major holiday for Russians, has been marked by rallies in other parts of Moscow since the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991, but until now parades were kept off Red Square.

PATRIOTIC UPLIFT

Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Rossiya 24 TV from Red Square that more than 100,000 people had marched through it.

This is not by chance, because there is a patriotic uplift and a good mood in the country, he said.

Russian television also showed footage of a May Day parade in Crimea's capital Simferopol, with Russian flags and banners reading Crimea is Russia. Welcome home.

We are sure that the current patriotic uplift in Crimea will spill over into the whole Russian Federation, Interfax news agency quoted Crimea's pro-Moscow leader Sergei Aksyonov as telling journalists.

Russia seized the peninsula last month after a pro-Russian Ukrainian president was toppled in February. The United States and European Union accuse Moscow of directing the uprising in south-eastern parts of Ukraine and have imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and companies.

The sanctions, while not hitting Russia's industry directly, have hurt the economy by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The International Monetary Fund cut its outlook for Russian 2014 economic growth this to just 0.2 percent on Wednesday and said Russia was already experiencing recession.

But at home, the intervention in Ukraine has been enormously popular. One opinion poll on Wednesday showed 82 percent support for Putin, his highest rating since 2010.

Western sanctions won't affect us. Crimea was historically part of Russia, and it's only right that we've become whole again, said Tatyana Ivanova, a worker at Moscow Housebuilding Factory No. 1 celebrating May Day with four colleagues.

But not all Muscovites were so impressed.

Today isn't a particularly special holiday, it's just a nice spring day, and people are happy to have an opportunity to celebrate, said historian Kirill Strakhov, 31, speaking on another square near Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre.

The authorities are trying to drum up support by encouraging patriotic feelings. They ignore the fact that there are many difficult economic and geopolitical problems associated with the unification of Crimea.

Putin has also revived the Soviet-era practice of staging massive displays of military firepower on Red Square to mark May 9, the allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two, one of the most important days in the Soviet and Russian calendars.

Central Moscow streets have been partially closed in recent days as tanks and mobile rocket launchers rehearse for that parade next week.

Tens of thousands of jubilant Russians took to the streets of Moscow to march past the Kremlin, through Red Square and up a central boulevard – the first time that trade unions held May Day marches through Red Square since 1991, shortly before the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Children tugging on balloons, elderly, medal-bedecked veterans – and a wide range of Russians in between – sang old labor songs on a sunny Moscow day. Some sported signs saying “Let’s go vacation in Crimea,” the peninsula that was an autonomous region of Ukraine until it was annexed by Russia in March, setting off one of the most dangerous confrontations between Russia and the West since the end of the Cold War. Others carried banners condemning President Obama and NATO, which many Russians regard as a security threat that has crept up to their borders. In this flower-mad nation, many women carried red carnations.

“Today is a wonderful day!” the head of the Moscow Trade Union Federation, Sergey Chernov, told the crowd from a stand in front of GUM, the famous department store that abuts Red Square. “Crimea and Sevastopol have returned to Russia! Unions have returned to Red Square!”

In keeping with the retro mood, President Vladimir Putin awarded five people the “Hero of Labor” medal, a Soviet-era honor that he revived last year. An oil company worker, a museum director, a farm manager, a high school teacher and the coach of the Russian National Synchronized Swimming team were all given medals Thursday.

“We have a very good tradition,” Putin said in a ceremony at the Kremlin. “On the 1st of May, the day of spring and Labor Day, we honor the citizens of Russia that, through their achievements, have improved the power, prestige and wealth of our country.”

But after the main rally had disbanded, a discordant tune sliced through the air. Seven protesters singing the Ukrainian national anthem and carrying a Ukrainian flag marched down empty, upscale Tverskaya Boulevard. More than a dozen police officers charged at them, throwing two men and one woman into a nearby police van and ripping up the Ukrainian flag. The woman shouted from the van that the police were being violent – but then the door slammed and her voice could no longer be heard.

“We're here because we have no alternatives. No one is listening to us,” said one protester who wasn’t arrested and who was dressed in Ukrainian yellow and blue. “There are very few of us,” she said.","MOSCOW – The 1st of May in Russia is always a nationwide excuse for a party, but in this newly expansionist Russian epoch, Thursday’s rallies were far larger than usual.

The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed surprise at the allegation, saying the Cold War arms race was decades in the past and that Russia and the United States had been negotiating nuclear cuts almost constantly for years.

The Russian delegation did not attend a special meeting of the OSCE Forum for Security Cooperation and the OSCE Permanent Council convened on Wednesday, April 30, over Russian military activities near the Ukrainian border.

Russia sees no point in explaining for the second time in one day its military activity near the Ukrainian border, Andrei Kelin, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said.

“We see no point in doing this because I said this morning at a meeting of the Permanent Council that military exercises had been held but as soon as the Kiev authorities said that they would not use the Armed Forces against the people, the Russian units were withdrawn to their permanent bases away from the Russian-Ukrainian border,” Kelin said.

“This is the third senseless attempt to convene this extraordinary mechanism which is provided for in Section 3 of the Vienna Document. The purpose of doing this is to create the atmosphere of extraordinariness and justify the inaction and incompetence of the Kiev authorities,” the diplomat said. “They cannot control the situation in the east of the country without starting a dialogue, and as protests there are gaining momentum, it will be increasingly difficult to come to agreement on constitutional reform, the status of the language and other issues.”

U.S. Permanent Representative to the OSCE Daniel Baer was so much displeased with the absence of the Russian envoy that he Twitted pictures of his empty seat from two angles, having obviously had to walk around the room to take them.

On April 24, Kiev sent an official inquiry to the OSCE following Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu’s statement that battalion-level tactical groups of the Southern and Western Military Districts had started exercises in regions bordering on Ukraine.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that in reply to Kiev’s inquiry Moscow had failed to provide exhaustive explanations regarding the purpose and place of military manoeuvres held in the Southern and Western Military Districts over the past several days near the Ukrainian border, the date of their completion and the number and type of military units involved.

“Given the insufficient information received, Ukraine has suggested to the Russian Federation that consultations be held in Vienna on April 28, as provided for in the abovementioned document, in order to discuss this issue. Other states that have voiced concern about Russia’s military activities near the Ukrainian border have also been invited to take part in the consultations,” the Foreign Ministry said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the Russia Today television channel this week that Russian troops were staying on their own territory and were not taking any steps that would go against their obligations.

“We have never denied the fact that we sent additional troops to the border [with Ukraine] just as the Ukrainian government redeployed its troops closer to our border. Our troops are conducting exercises on the territory of our own country. Such exercises are conducted regularly since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister,” Lavrov said.

Exercises are held in different parts of Russia. “As far as I know, the next exercises will be held in the north-west of the country. This is a continuous process. The army must be in good shape and ready to act while hoping that it will not have to interfere,” the minister said.

“However, if we are attacked, we will respond by all means. If our legitimate interests and the interests of Russian people are directly affected, as was the case in South Ossetia, I see no way to respond other than doping so in full compliance with international law. Those who threaten the security of Russian citizens jeopardise the security of the whole country,” Lavrov said.

He stressed the fact that Russian troops were staying on the territory of Russia. “Demands for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document of 2011 and the Treaty on Open Skies were satisfied. Inspectors from the United States, the European Union and Ukraine visited Russian troops’ bases and could not cite even one fact that would signify dangerous military activities on the part of Russia,” the minister said.

“We are on our own territory and are not taking any actions that would go against our obligations,” he said. “Ukrainian troops are also staying on their territory, but the difference is that they have an order allowing them to use weapons against peaceful citizens. This is a criminal order.","VIENNA, April 30 /ITAR-TASS/. The Russian delegation did not attend a special meeting of the OSCE Forum for Security Cooperation and the OSCE Permanent Council convened on Wednesday, April 30, over Russian military activities near the Ukrainian border.

Russia sees no point in explaining for the second time in one day its military activity near the Ukrainian border, Andrei Kelin, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said.

“We see no point in doing this because I said this morning at a meeting of the Permanent Council that military exercises had been held but as soon as the Kiev authorities said that they would not use the Armed Forces against the people, the Russian units were withdrawn to their permanent bases away from the Russian-Ukrainian border,” Kelin said.

The West has cut all paths to a peaceful solution of the Ukrainian crisis by supporting the Kiev authorities and their violent crackdown on protests in the eastern part of the country, Russia’s envoy Vitaly Churkin told the UN Security Council.


  Catastrophic consequences are inevitable if Kiev authorities do
  not stop their “criminal venture,” Churkin stressed at
  the emergency UNSC meeting summoned by Moscow on Friday.



  He pointed out that Kiev has flagrantly violated its obligations
  that were established under the Geneva agreement on April 17. The
  punitive measures carried out by the government are
  evidence of Kiev’s inability and unwillingness to fulfill these
  obligations, he added.



  “Particular concern is raised by data that, during the
  punitive operation of the Ukrainian military and illegal
  ultra-nationalist groups, English speech was heard on air, and
  among the assailants on Slavyansk, English speaking foreigners
  were seen,” the Russian UN envoy said.



  In reference to the disturbing events in Odessa where at least 31
  people have died after radicals set fire to the Trade Unions
  House, Churkin said that such “actions are reminiscent of the
  crimes of the Nazis from whom the Ukrainian ultra-nationalists
  derive their ideological inspiration.”

We expect – we demand that the western advocates of the
  Ukrainian authorities, including US Secretary of State John
  Kerry, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, French
  Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and UK Foreign Secretary William
  Hague, join Russia in unequivocally condemning this barbaric
  act, the Russian envoy said in a statement released by his
  office.



  He stressed that Moscow “insists on avoiding any external
  interference in what is happening in Ukraine.”



  “Kiev regime, encouraged by its Western sponsors, used
  massive use of military force, practically destroying the last
  hope for the viability of the Geneva agreement,” Churkin
  said.



  The Russian envoy to the UN has urged Kiev and all sides who took
  part in the Geneva deal – the US and EU – to “refrain from
  making grave mistakes” and “soberly assess the full
  responsibility of the possible consequences of their
  actions.



  “Supporting the organizers of the Kiev government coup and
  their military crackdown on protesters, the US and EU take great
  responsibility practically cutting all paths to resolve the
  crisis peacefully,” Churkin concluded.



  Against this background, “Washington’s flat refusal” to
  support the proposal on organizing an OSCE-supported dialogue
  between Kiev and southeastern Ukraine looks “not
  coincidental,” Churkin said.



  Kiev has intensified its military operation in eastern Ukraine,
  with the country's new authorities unleashing heavy weaponry on
  Slavyansk on Friday morning. Helicopters and
  APCs blockaded the city, preventing the evacuation of civilians.
  The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
  has urged for the creation of humanitarian corridors.



  In response, Russia summoned an emergency UNSC meeting aimed at
  ending the violence and bloodshed.
  
  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he is very concerned about
  the events in eastern Ukraine and urged all sides of the conflict
  to show “restraint.”The escalation of violence and reports of further casualties

Moscow is “extremely concerned” by the Kiev regime’s “political repression and persecution” against those who dare express opposition, the Russian Foreign Ministry said calling for the release all political prisoners.

“Mass media reports give us reason to speak of the start of a
  ‘witch hunt’, mass prosecution of dissidents and political
  repressions and persecutions against those who dare disagree with
  the Maidan [coup-imposed] authorities,” Russia’s Foreign
  Ministry said in a statement.



  It particularly recalled the case of recently arrested “people’s
  governor” of Donetsk, Pavel Gubarev.


“We are seriously concerned about the condition of Pavel
  Gubarev elected ‘a people’s governor’ of Donetsk,” the
  ministry said, adding that he was abducted, charged with
  organizing mass unrests and attempting to divide Ukraine, and
  tortured. He went on hunger strike against Kiev’s crackdown on
  protesters in Slavyansk, eastern Ukraine.



  According to the Ministry, the Organization for Security and
  Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Red Cross, managed to get
  access to Gubarev and visit him in prison on April 26, following
  “insistent calls” by Russia. The organizations confirmed the
  abovementioned situation.


“Pavel Gubarev is not the only political prisoner of the Kiev
  regime,” the statement stressed.



  Citing local mass media, the Ministry also said that Moscow is
  seriously worried by reports about the construction of large
  temporary detention centers for thousands of people in Ukraine,
  allegedly for illegal migrants.


“There is no such large number of illegal migrants in
  Ukraine, and buildings that are being erected, according to media
  reports, are very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps. The
  question arises, whether the Kiev regime plans to drive together
  dissenting citizens there from the South-Eastern regions of the
  country,” the ministry said.



  If true, all that “does not accord” with the norms of
  the OSCE and the European Council as well as obligations to
  amnesty political prisoners and participants in the protests,
  which Kiev agreed to during the four-party talks on Ukraine in
  Geneva on April 17.

The fugitive Snowden was granted asylum in Russia last year after exposing details of massive U.S. intelligence-gathering programs at home and abroad. It is considered unlikely that he would set foot in any U.S.-allied country like Germany because of the risk of being arrested and extradited.

But in a report, the German government made clear it had no wish to see Snowden come to testify in parliament as this would have a significant negative impact on the German-American relationship, particularly on cooperation with U.S. intelligence.

Snowden could, however, give testimony abroad, the report said, adding that German security interests should take precedence over the parliamentary investigation.

An attached report from a U.S. law firm sent to the German embassy in Washington said the United States has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed in Germany, Russia or elsewhere through which classified information from the U.S. has been disclosed.

That would make it an offence for a member of parliament to make secret U.S. information public, which could be the case if Snowden testified. The report said Washington might respect the immunity of German lawmakers but was not required to do so.

Chancellor Angela Merkel is in Washington to meet U.S. President Barack Obama but the no spy deal she demanded last year after reports that the National Security Agency tapped her mobile phone is not expected to come off.

The German government report also noted that if Snowden traveled to Germany, Berlin might be legally obliged to extradite him to the United States.

Christiane Wirtz, a spokeswoman for the German government, said it was ultimately up to the investigation committee to decide whether to invite Snowden or not.

Konstantin von Notz, a member of the opposition Greens and of the investigation committee, said his parliamentary faction would manage to get Snowden to testify by taking the issue to the constitutional court in Karlsruhe if necessary.

If there are attempts to prevent Snowden from giving evidence on these issues which are important for Germany and Europe, we will not shy away from taking this to Karlsruhe, he was quoted as saying by German broadcaster NDR.

He was charged last year in the United States with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified intelligence to an unauthorized person.

Snowden was believed to have taken 1.7 million computerized documents. The leaked documents revealed massive programs run by the NSA that gathered information on emails, phone calls and Internet use by hundreds of millions of Americans. The surveillance programs also extended to U.S. allies.

Even President Obama, thousands of miles away on a tour of Asia, was compelled to weigh in on the controversy.

But, as grotesque and unpalatable as the whole situation is, the immediate and near-universal condemnation heaped upon Sterling as the story grew viral is a sign that there is at root a fundamental intolerance for this sort of intolerance in the United States, despite all the racial injustices that remain.

Other parts of the world still have more work to do. Exhibit A: Romania, home of George Gigi Becali, possibly the most offensive owner in world sports.

Since 2003, Becali has been in charge of Steaua Bucharest, one of the more famous and historic club sides in Eastern Europe. He is one of Romania's richest men, a former shepherd turned real estate mogul who made his fortune in the chaos that followed the fall of Communism. He served in the European Parliament in Brussels from 2009 to 2012 and then in the Romanian parliament until May, when he was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a dodgy land-swaps deal. (He has a very checkered legal history — including an arrest on kidnapping charges and reports of match-fixing.) He is now in jail but still runs Steaua Bucharest.

But Becali is controversial for a whole other set of reasons: his penchant for homophobic, misogynist, racist rhetoric.

It'll be difficult to itemize every single offensive slur attributed to Becali, a larger-than-life man who has become something of a pantomime villain in the European press. A devout Orthodox Christian, Becali keeps artwork in his home depicting himself as Jesus and various apostles and saints. That religiosity has led to some extreme comments. In 2012, Becali reacted angrily to Lady Gaga's presence in Romania, whom he deemed a disciple of Satan: When she comes on the TV, I switch the channels after two seconds and spit on the TV, he said.

Worse are his thoughts on homosexuals. He banned songs by the British band Queen from being played at the stadium because of the sexuality of Queen's late lead singer. In 2010, Becali reportedly blocked the acquisition of a Bulgarian player because of rumors that he was gay. Two years later, after Steaua fans were heard singing homophobic chants, Becali offered this outrageous defense:

There is no excuse for discrimination. Yet, of course, while I love the gays, you must understand: gays cannot be in football teams. The players bathe naked! I love gays, but I'd never employ one. Put one in a team and you'd never win again.

That earned censure elsewhere but did little to diminish his popularity among a segment of Romania's population. Becali, not unlike Italy's Silvio Berlusconi (though more extreme), is a charismatic populist who has deployed his extensive wealth to win the support of a certain conservative base. Some critics see in Becali's slogans and campaigning gestures to the World War II-era Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist movement.

Far-right nationalism is very much alive in parts of Eastern Europe, and Becali's bigotry sadly echoes wider prejudice. He has made dark comments on what he deemed the infiltration of Jews in Romanian politics. He reportedly fired a Turkish coach once for being too Muslim. He once said women have no more value after giving birth. He called an African TV presenter an ape. He is attributed with making racist remarks about the Roma — the long-marginalized minority group in Eastern Europe known derogatorily as gypsies — and even ethnic Hungarians living in Romania.

And while he has no shortage of critics and opponents, the chances are that Becali will emerge unscathed from his imprisonment, still the owner of Steaua Bucharest as well as one of the world's most repugnant big mouths.","The comments allegedly made by Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, have generated an understandable furor in the United States, with many incensed by the vulgar racism aired in a leaked recording of a supposed conversation between him and a girlfriend. Even President Obama, thousands of miles away on a tour of Asia, was compelled to weigh in on the controversy.

But, as grotesque and unpalatable as the whole situation is, the immediate and near-universal condemnation heaped upon Sterling as the story grew viral is a sign that there is at root a fundamental intolerance for this sort of intolerance in the United States, despite all the racial injustices that remain.

Other parts of the world still have more work to do. Exhibit A: Romania, home of George Gigi Becali, possibly the most offensive owner in world sports.

Since 2003, Becali has been in charge of Steaua Bucharest, one of the more famous and historic club sides in Eastern Europe. He is one of Romania's richest men, a former shepherd turned real estate mogul who made his fortune in the chaos that followed the fall of Communism. He served in the European Parliament in Brussels from 2009 to 2012 and then in the Romanian parliament until May, when he was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a dodgy land-swaps deal. (He has a very checkered legal history — including an arrest on kidnapping charges and reports of match-fixing.) He is now in jail but still runs Steaua Bucharest.

But Becali is controversial for a whole other set of reasons: his penchant for homophobic, misogynist, racist rhetoric.

It'll be difficult to itemize every single offensive slur attributed to Becali, a larger-than-life man who has become something of a pantomime villain in the European press. A devout Orthodox Christian, Becali keeps artwork in his home depicting himself as Jesus and various apostles and saints. That religiosity has led to some extreme comments. In 2012, Becali reacted angrily to Lady Gaga's presence in Romania, whom he deemed a disciple of Satan: When she comes on the TV, I switch the channels after two seconds and spit on the TV, he said.

Worse are his thoughts on homosexuals. He banned songs by the British band Queen from being played at the stadium because of the sexuality of Queen's late lead singer. In 2010, Becali reportedly blocked the acquisition of a Bulgarian player because of rumors that he was gay. Two years later, after Steaua fans were heard singing homophobic chants, Becali offered this outrageous defense:

The United States was initially behind the events in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday.

“I think what is happening there now shows us who really managed the process from the start. But at first the United States preferred to stay in the background,” Putin told journalists when asked about his attitude toward America playing the lead in the situation around Ukraine.

He said the fact that now the United States is in the foreground in the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis shows that the US led this process initially, but only displayed itself as the leader of this entire process now”.

Putin said that at first, the interests of the United States and its European partners coincided because the European Union “wanted to strike a well-known [association] agreement with Ukraine on terms that I believe were unprofitable for Ukraine”.

The previous Kiev government tried to fight it, but “the Western community followed another scenario, implementing the military scenario, an anti-constitutional coup, an armed seizure of power,” he said.

According to Putin, the events’ initiators did not calculate what they could lead to. The Russian president said that although many people in Ukraine “liked” such a coup, still “many [people] don’t like it, and they disagree with that form of power change”. He added that there is “nothing democratic” in that.

Putin not authorized response to the Western sanctions despite government proposials

Putin also said the Russian government proposed imposing sanctions against the United States and the European Union in response to their sanctions, but added that he has not authorized them yet.

“The government of the Russian Federation has already proposed some retaliatory steps. I think there’s not need,” the head of state told journalists.

However, he said, “if something like that continues, we will of course have to think about who and how works in the Russian Federation, in the key branches of Russia’s economy, including energy”.

“We would not like to resort to some steps, retaliatory measures, I hope there will be no need,” Putin said.

“People should be taken into account, their legal rights should be respected,” he said.

Crisis in Ukraine

The situation in Ukraine has been far from stable since a coup occurred in the country two months ago and new people were brought to power amid deadly riots triggered by President Viktor Yanukovich’s decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the EU in November 2013 in order to study the deal more thoroughly.

Yanukovich had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns in February.

Russia does not recognize the new self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities, but the West says they are legitimate.

The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, a city with a special status on the Crimean Peninsula, where most residents are Russians, signed reunification deals with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation.

After Crimea’s incorporation by Russia, which Kiev and Western countries do not recognize despite Russia’s repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law and the UN Charter and conformed to the precedent set by Kosovo’s secession from Serbia in 2008, pro-federalization protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeastern regions.","MINSK, April 30 /ITAR-TASS/.

A group of NATO ships has arrived in the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda to “ensure regional security,” the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense has said. Russia has already voiced its concern over the “unprecedented” buildup of NATO forces in the region.


  The group is composed of 4 minesweeping ships from Norway, the
  Netherlands, Belgium and Estonia as well as one supply vessel.
  The ships will take part in intensive military drills, stopping
  off at various ports in the region. They will also participate in
  operation “Open Sprit” deactivating underwater
  explosives.



  The Lithuanian Minister of Defense Juozas Olekas said in a
  statement the drills will “ensure our national and regional
  security and collective defense.”


  The contingent of ships is not the only NATO force to have been
  deployed in the region recently. Last week, the United States
  announced the deployment of 600 soldiers who will participate in
  military drills in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to show
  solidarity with NATO members that border Russia.



  In addition, Britain and France have sent 8 fighter jets to
  Poland and Lithuania to step up aerial patrol in the region. As
  well as the increased aerial presence, NATO has also deployed
  ships in the Black Sea, Baltic Sea and East Mediterranean.

  and work together to defuse the situation.

A new 10-year military agreement, which also covers storage of equipment for maritime security and humanitarian assistance, was signed with the United States last week, hours before President Barack Obama arrived for a two-day visit to Manila.

Right now, the discussions would be ranging from three to five Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) bases, said Pio Lorenzo Batino, a defense undersecretary and head of the negotiating panel, told a news conference. That's not final.

He said the army's jungle training base in Fort Magsaysay, north of Manila, was ideal location for the United States because the two oldest allies in the region regularly hold joint

exercises there.

Military sources familiar with the discussions said the United States has also requested access to three former U.S. bases -- Clark airfield, Subic bay, Poro Point -- and Camp Aguinaldo, the military general headquarters in Manila.

The United States is also considering whether to seek access to four civil airports - Palawan, Cebu, General Santos, and Laoag - as well as Batanes airfield for refueling and emergency servicing, the sources said. There are also nearby bases in Cebu and Palawan.

Defense and military officials said the new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) will boost the Philippines' defense capabilities.

Territorial disputes have made the South China Sea, believed to have rich deposits of oil and gas, a potential flashpoint for the region.

Other countries with competing claims include Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.

China has become increasingly assertive in the disputed waters, seizing control of Scarborough Shoal in 2012 and has been blockading Second Thomas Shoal, where a Philippine Navy transport ship was deliberately run aground in 1999 to establish a presence.

The United States is also considering whether to seek access to four civil airports - Palawan, Cebu, General Santos, and Laoag - as well as Batanes airfield for refueling and emergency servicing, the sources said. There are also nearby bases in Cebu and Palawan.

Defense and military officials said the new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) will boost the Philippines' defense capabilities.

Territorial disputes have made the South China Sea, believed to have rich deposits of oil and gas, a potential flashpoint for the region.

Other countries with competing claims include Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.

China has become increasingly assertive in the disputed waters, seizing control of Scarborough Shoal in 2012 and has been blockading Second Thomas Shoal, where a Philippine Navy transport ship was deliberately run aground in 1999 to establish a presence.

Russia’s leading manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks, KAMAZ Group sold its Ukrainian segment of distribution and customer service business to a foreign partner, materials released by the company say.

Uncertainties of the economic and political situation in Ukraine and the slide of the hrivna’s exchange rate against the major international currencies have depressed liquidity and toughened the terms for borrowings, KAMAZ says.

“In March 2014, the group sold its business related to the sales and customer servicing in Ukraine to a foreign partner,” the report says.

At the end of 2013, the assets of the group vulnerable to the risks arising from the situation in Ukraine stood at around 760 million rubles (USD 1 is equivalent of 36.0 rubles at the current exchange rate).

As a result, the group posted revenue of 58 million rubles.

In December 2013, KAMAZ purchased 42.07% in the company KAMAZ Vectra Motors Ltd., thus building up its package to 100%. It paid 68 million rubles for the transaction.

The joint-venture and sells cars and does customer support belonged to an Indian company then. In the aftermath of the purchase, KAMAZ has nineteen joint-ventures at the moment.

In February 2014, KAMAZ paid off the second tranche of bonds in the amount of 3 billion rubles and it opened a range of new loan facilities to the tune of 3.7 billion rubles.

An average interest rate under these facilities totals 9% annual and the debts mature in the period of 2019 through to 2022.

“The groups’ liabilities on these loans stood at 36 million rubles on the reporting date,” the report says.

KAMAZ occupies the 16th position in the world among the leading manufacturers of heavy-duty and the eighth position as regards the manufacturing of diesel-powered engines.

The group’s technological chain embraces eleven automobile factories and subsidiary enterprises.

“As regards sanctions as pressure upon Russia designed to make it change its foreign policy, this is totally unacceptable with any sovereign state in the world, especially with such a powerful and influential state as Russia that plays a huge role in the global politics and economy,” she stressed.

 

Who is in the blacklist?

The list contains 15 names of Russian officials and Ukrainian southeastern resistance members, namely: Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, presidential plenipotentiary in the Crimean Federal District Oleg Belaventsev, Crimean Affairs Minister Oleg Savelyev, Sevastopol federal city governor Sergey Menyailo, senator from Crimea Olga Kovitidi, deputy speakers of Russia’s State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Lyudmila Shvetsova and Sergey Neverov.

The list also includes the names of Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Director Igor Sergun, Russian Armed Forces General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov, GRU officer Igor Strelkov, militia leaders in Ukraine’s southeast German Prokopyev and Valery Bolotov, head of the proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) Andrey Purgin, DNR leaders Denis Pushilin and Sergey Tsyplakov.

Western countries have imposed targeted sanctions on some Russian and Crimean officials following Crimea’s reunification with Russia in March, but Moscow has responded tit-for-tat.

 

Crimea reunification with Russia

The developments came after a coup in Ukraine in February, when new people were brought to power in Ukraine amid deadly riots triggered by President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the EU in November 2013 in order to study the deal more thoroughly.

Yanukovych had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns the same month. Crimea refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities.

Russia does not recognize the new Ukrainian leaders, who appear unable to restrain radicals and ultranationalists, either.

Despite Russia’s repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law and the UN Charter and in conformity with the precedent set by Kosovo’s secession from Serbia in 2008, Kiev and Western countries do not recognize Crimea’s accession to Russia.

After Crimea's incorporation by Russia, protests against the new Kiev leaders erupted in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking southeastern regions. Demonstrators, who are demanding referendums on the country’s federalization, seized some government buildings.

The West has already expanded its sanctions against Russia since they were first imposed and has threatened Russia with new economic sanctions unless Moscow changes its foreign policy. Moscow has said the imposition of sanctions against it is counterproductive and will have a boomerang effect on Western nations.

In the Soviet Union, Crimea used to be part of Russia until 1954, when Nikita Khrushchev, the first secretary of the USSR’s Communist Party, transferred it to Ukraine's jurisdiction as a gift.","“This is the case when we should respond tit-for-tat, draft response measures so that no one can talk to Russia in this language,” Matviyenko told journalists while commenting on expansion of Western sanctions against Russia.

Clippers owner Donald Sterling","NBA players protest racist talk attributed to L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling(CNN) -- The players in the National Basketball Association spoke out Sunday about racist comments attributed to Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling.

The Clippers players staged a silent protest. As they warmed up for an NBA playoff game, the players removed their warmup shirts bearing team logos to reveal red T-shirts worn inside out, with the logos hidden. They finished warming up, removed the red shirts and played the game wearing their regular uniforms.

The National Basketball Players Association demanded Sterling be barred from all playoff games this season. The players also want an accounting of past accusations of racism against Sterling; an explanation of what kind of discipline might be issued; assurance that the league commissioner will work with the association; and assurance the investigation will be conducted swiftly.

And throughout the day, past stars including Michael Jordan slammed Sterling.

Sterling wasn't there to see the protest or his team lose 118-97 to the Golden State Warriors. He agreed to stay away from the game because of the controversy that heightened Sunday when the website Deadspin released an additional audio recording of a conversation that purports to be Sterling talking with girlfriend V. Stiviano earlier this month.

Neither Deadspin nor TMZ, which released a similar recording Saturday, said where they got the recordings. Stiviano's lawyer's office said Sunday that she didn't release the recordings but that they're legitimate.

This office understands that the currently released audio tape of approximately 15 minutes is a portion of approximately one (1) hour of overall audio recording of Mr. Donald T. Sterling and Ms. Stiviano, and is in fact legitimate, Mac E. Nehoray said in a news release. Ms. Stiviano did not release the tape(s) to any news media.

The 15-minute Deadspin recording purports to be Sterling talking with Stiviano about her Instagram photo feed. The photos include images of her with African-Americans, including NBA great Earvin Magic Johnson.

If authentic, the remarks seem to reflect Sterling's embarrassment and frustration with Stiviano over her associating with African-Americans at Clippers games and for posting such pictures on her Instagram account.

Three NBA legends lashed out at Sterling Sunday.

Jordan, considered the league's greatest player and now the majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, said: As an owner, I'm obviously disgusted that a fellow team owner could hold such sickening and offensive views. ... As a former player, I'm completely outraged. There is no room in the NBA -- or anywhere else -- for the kind of racism and hatred that Mr. Sterling allegedly expressed.

NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was a Clippers special assistant coach in 2000, told CNN: I know him. I know his voice. I am not surprised by this very much.

But Abdul-Jabbar said Sterling was congenial in person and said he never heard any racist words from Sterling. Still, the recording shows a repugnant attitude for someone to have, and for him to be an employer for so many people of color, it kind of blows your mind.

Johnson, speaking on an ABC pregame show Sunday, said Sterling needs to go.

He shouldn't own a team any more. And he should stand up and say, 'I don't want to own a team any more,'  Johnson said.

'Is that racism?'

In the latest recording, a man and woman talk about the photos, and he tells her he cannot change cultural beliefs, Deadspin reported.

The woman says she doesn't think the man is racist but the people around him have poison minds.

It's the world! You go to Israel, the blacks are just treated like dogs, the man says.

He says there are white Jews and black Jews, and they are treated 100% differently.

And is that right? the woman asks.

It isn't a question -- we don't evaluate what's right and wrong, we live in a society. We live in a culture. We have to live within that culture, the man replies.

When the woman says she doesn't share the man's views about race, he tells her: Well, then, if you don't feel -- don't come to my games. Don't bring black people, and don't come.

The woman, who says she is of mixed race, reminds him that most of his team's players are African-American.

I support them and give them food, and clothes, and cars, and houses. Who gives it to them? Does someone else give it to them? Do I know that I have -- Who makes the game? Do I make the game, or do they make the game?

The woman compares racial discrimination to the Holocaust.

And you're Jewish. You understand discrimination, she says.

The man disagrees with the analogy and says that what he's talking about is not discrimination.

There's no racism here. If you don't want to be walking into a basketball game with a certain person, is that racism? the man says.

Investigation underway

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Saturday that Sterling, who has owned the basketball franchise for nearly three decades, is now under investigation over the comments attributed to him.

Silver said that the league's investigation will seek to determine whether the recording is authentic and to figure out the context in which these offensive and disturbing comments were made.

But he cautioned that Sterling must be afforded due process, so he would not speculate on any possible punishment, but said that the investigation will move extraordinarily quickly.

Clippers President Andy Roeser on Saturday suggested a woman -- whom he doesn't mention by name -- was getting even with Sterling over a lawsuit.

Rochelle Sterling, the wife of Donald Sterling, filed a lawsuit last month against Stiviano, who she said was having an affair with her husband.

In the complaint, Rochelle Sterling accuses Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. The suit claims that Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys, and a Range Rover and that Stiviano took possession of a $1.8 million duplex through fraud. Sterling also gave her nearly $250,000 in cash, the court document says.

Stiviano countered in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts, and she never took advantage of the Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate.

Reaction: 'Disturbing and offensive'

'And don't bring him to my games'

Speaking about the recording, Roeser said, We do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered. We do know that the woman on the tape -- who we believe released it to TMZ -- is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even.'

According to the website TMZ, Sterling reportedly made discriminatory remarks during an argument he had with Stiviano on April 9. TMZ on Saturday posted a 10-minute recording purporting to be the argument.

The man alleged to be Sterling takes particular exception to a photo she posted to Instagram with Johnson.

In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people, the man says.

If it's white people, it's OK? she responds. If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?

Bird, the longtime Boston Celtics star, was Johnson's NBA rival.

I've known (Magic) well and he should be admired. ... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately, the man on the recording says. Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games.

Roeser said Sterling is upset and apologizes for sentiments attributed to him about Johnson. (Sterling) has long considered Magic a friend and has only the utmost respect and admiration for him -- both in terms of who he is and what he has achieved.

Sterling is emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect his views, beliefs or feelings, Roeser said.

President Obama'sresponse

President Barack Obama weighed in on the controversy.

At a news conference with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Sunday, Obama was asked about the comments on the recording.

When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk. That's what happened here, the President said.

Obama also said Sterling's alleged comments are an example of how the United States continues to wrestle with the legacy of race and slavery and segregation.

The president of the California NAACP suggested fans boycott Clippers games.

We also suggest that African-Americans and Latinos should honor (Sterling's) request and not attend the games, Alice Huffman said in a statement released Saturday.

Sterling was to receive a lifetime achievement award at an event next month to mark the 100th anniversary of the Los Angeles NAACP, but the national organization tweeted Sunday that wouldn't happen.

LeBron James speaks out

The release of the recordings comes at a bad time for the Clippers, who are playing in the first round of the NBA playoffs.

I don't know if I'm surprised or not, Clippers head coach Doc Rivers said at the team's practice Saturday, adding that he obviously didn't like the comments.

Rivers, who is in his first year coaching the team, told reporters that he didn't want the controversy to detract from the playoffs. He said he would be the sole person speaking on behalf of the team.

But Chris Paul, a Clippers player and president of the National Basketball Players Association, issued a statement Saturday saying this is a very serious issue which we will address aggressively.

Helping the players association will be Kevin Johnson, a former NBA player and current Sacramento, California, mayor. There needs to be an immediate investigation, and if the reports are true, there needs to be strong and swift action taken, Johnson said in a statement on the NBPA website.

Miami Heat forward LeBron James was one of several players and former players who weighed in on the controversy. James spoke to reporters before the playoff game against the Charlotte Bobcats Saturday night.

If the reports are true, it's unacceptable. It's unacceptable in our league. It doesn't matter if you're white, black, Hispanic, whatever, all across the races. It's unacceptable, and as a commissioner in our league, they have to make a stand, and they have to be very aggressive with it.

Should this guy continue to be an owner? asked Shaquille O'Neal, who also called the comments repugnant.

We cannot have an NBA owner discriminating against the league, said Charles Barkley. We're a black league.

Both discussed the issue during the Atlanta Hawks-Indiana Pacers halftime program on TNT, which like CNN is a division of Time Warner.

Will the NBA make Sterling the first owner to give up team?

He shouldn't own a team any more. And he should stand up and say, 'I don't want to own a team any more,'  Johnson said.

'Is that racism?'

In the latest recording, a man and woman talk about the photos, and he tells her he cannot change cultural beliefs, Deadspin reported.

The woman says she doesn't think the man is racist but the people around him have poison minds.

It's the world! You go to Israel, the blacks are just treated like dogs, the man says.

He says there are white Jews and black Jews, and they are treated 100% differently.

And is that right? the woman asks.

It isn't a question -- we don't evaluate what's right and wrong, we live in a society. We live in a culture. We have to live within that culture, the man replies.

When the woman says she doesn't share the man's views about race, he tells her: Well, then, if you don't feel -- don't come to my games. Don't bring black people, and don't come.

The woman, who says she is of mixed race, reminds him that most of his team's players are African-American.

I support them and give them food, and clothes, and cars, and houses. Who gives it to them? Does someone else give it to them? Do I know that I have -- Who makes the game? Do I make the game, or do they make the game?

The woman compares racial discrimination to the Holocaust.

And you're Jewish. You understand discrimination, she says.

The man disagrees with the analogy and says that what he's talking about is not discrimination.

There's no racism here. If you don't want to be walking into a basketball game with a certain person, is that racism? the man says.

Investigation underway

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Saturday that Sterling, who has owned the basketball franchise for nearly three decades, is now under investigation over the comments attributed to him.

Silver said that the league's investigation will seek to determine whether the recording is authentic and to figure out the context in which these offensive and disturbing comments were made.

But he cautioned that Sterling must be afforded due process, so he would not speculate on any possible punishment, but said that the investigation will move extraordinarily quickly.

Clippers President Andy Roeser on Saturday suggested a woman -- whom he doesn't mention by name -- was getting even with Sterling over a lawsuit.

Rochelle Sterling, the wife of Donald Sterling, filed a lawsuit last month against Stiviano, who she said was having an affair with her husband.

In the complaint, Rochelle Sterling accuses Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. The suit claims that Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys, and a Range Rover and that Stiviano took possession of a $1.8 million duplex through fraud. Sterling also gave her nearly $250,000 in cash, the court document says.

Stiviano countered in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts, and she never took advantage of the Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate.

Reaction: 'Disturbing and offensive'

'And don't bring him to my games'

Speaking about the recording, Roeser said, We do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered. We do know that the woman on the tape -- who we believe released it to TMZ -- is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even.'

According to the website TMZ, Sterling reportedly made discriminatory remarks during an argument he had with Stiviano on April 9. TMZ on Saturday posted a 10-minute recording purporting to be the argument.

The man alleged to be Sterling takes particular exception to a photo she posted to Instagram with Johnson.

In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people, the man says.

If it's white people, it's OK? she responds. If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?

Bird, the longtime Boston Celtics star, was Johnson's NBA rival.

I've known (Magic) well and he should be admired. ... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately, the man on the recording says. Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games.

Roeser said Sterling is upset and apologizes for sentiments attributed to him about Johnson. (Sterling) has long considered Magic a friend and has only the utmost respect and admiration for him -- both in terms of who he is and what he has achieved.

Sterling is emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect his views, beliefs or feelings, Roeser said.

President Obama'sresponse

President Barack Obama weighed in on the controversy.

At a news conference with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Sunday, Obama was asked about the comments on the recording.

When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk. That's what happened here, the President said.

Obama also said Sterling's alleged comments are an example of how the United States continues to wrestle with the legacy of race and slavery and segregation.

The president of the California NAACP suggested fans boycott Clippers games.

We also suggest that African-Americans and Latinos should honor (Sterling's) request and not attend the games, Alice Huffman said in a statement released Saturday.

Sterling was to receive a lifetime achievement award at an event next month to mark the 100th anniversary of the Los Angeles NAACP, but the national organization tweeted Sunday that wouldn't happen.

LeBron James speaks out

The release of the recordings comes at a bad time for the Clippers, who are playing in the first round of the NBA playoffs.

I don't know if I'm surprised or not, Clippers head coach Doc Rivers said at the team's practice Saturday, adding that he obviously didn't like the comments.

Rivers, who is in his first year coaching the team, told reporters that he didn't want the controversy to detract from the playoffs. He said he would be the sole person speaking on behalf of the team.

But Chris Paul, a Clippers player and president of the National Basketball Players Association, issued a statement Saturday saying this is a very serious issue which we will address aggressively.

Helping the players association will be Kevin Johnson, a former NBA player and current Sacramento, California, mayor. There needs to be an immediate investigation, and if the reports are true, there needs to be strong and swift action taken, Johnson said in a statement on the NBPA website.

Miami Heat forward LeBron James was one of several players and former players who weighed in on the controversy. James spoke to reporters before the playoff game against the Charlotte Bobcats Saturday night.

If the reports are true, it's unacceptable. It's unacceptable in our league. It doesn't matter if you're white, black, Hispanic, whatever, all across the races. It's unacceptable, and as a commissioner in our league, they have to make a stand, and they have to be very aggressive with it.

Should this guy continue to be an owner? asked Shaquille O'Neal, who also called the comments repugnant.

We cannot have an NBA owner discriminating against the league, said Charles Barkley. We're a black league.

Both discussed the issue during the Atlanta Hawks-Indiana Pacers halftime program on TNT, which like CNN is a division of Time Warner.

Will the NBA make Sterling the first owner to give up team?

The metro ads by the group #CubaNow are designed to highlight economic changes happening in Cuba. The group believes the 52-year-old U.S. embargo against the communist-ruled island has not worked.

It's time to bring the conversation on U.S.-Cuba policy into the 21st century, said #CubaNow director Ric Herrero.

The group said its mission, unlike other Cuba policy groups, was specifically focused on changing U.S. thinking about Cuba policy.

While the group opposes the embargo, it recognized that overturning it in Congress is an uphill battle and other ways can be found to change policy, such as allowing all Americans to travel to Cuba.

There's plenty the President can do within his existing authority, said #CubaNow founding member Andres D?­az, a Cuban-born former Obama administration official at the Department of Commerce.

#CubaNow was founded by a group of mostly younger generation Cuban Americans. Herrero declined to discuss its funding.

The group's launch coincides with the fifth anniversary of Obama's 2009 steps allowing Cuban-Americans to travel freely to visit relatives in Cuba as well as send remittances.

That policy shift helped usher in more change in that time than had been seen in the previous 50 years, the group said in a press release.

Herrero said the group, based in Miami and Washington, wants the White House to take new steps to encourage Cuba's burgeoning private sector which has emerged under economic reforms being slowly introduced by the Cuban government.

The group's founding is part of a new wave of efforts to prod Obama into taking bolder steps to engage the Cuban government.

It follows a February poll by the Atlantic Council which found a majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba.

In November, Obama told a Miami area fundraiser that it may be time for the United States to update its policies toward Cuba.

Blue jeans and rock?ˆ?n roll brought down the Berlin Wall, so we have to recognize that there is a new wave of energy pushing a new approach toward U.S.-Cuba policy, said Alex Castellanos, a Republican political strategist who is Cuban American.

Obama landed just hours after Philippine Defence Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg signed a new military agreement allowing more troops in the country.The Philippine government said the pact was an affirmation of the robust and enduring strategic partnership between the two allies. Talking to reporters in Manila, Goldberg, said that the new agreement would not allow the reopening of US bases in the Philippines, something that has been opposed by nationalist forces and is prohibited by the 1987 Constitution.

But the agreement essentially allows US access to Philippine military bases across the country.

Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, chairman of the Philippines Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, told Al Jazeera that the agreement has marginal advantages for the country, and is more beneficial to the US.

With the signing of the agreement, Santiago said the US could claim that it has 'contained' China, because the Asian countries involved, including the Philippines, are now bound by their respective agreements with America.

It would make the Philippines sounds as if we are a satellite ally of America, she said.

During a joint press conference with the Philippine president, President Obama said he goal of the US was not to contain China.

We welcome China's peaceful rise. We have a constructive relationship with China, Obama said.

Our goal is not to counter China, our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make international rules and norms are respected, and that includes areas of maritime disputes.

Our primary interest is the peaceful resolution of conflict, including navigation that allows for continued progress and prosperity. We continue to stand shoulder to shoulder to uphold peace and security in this region and around the world.

Philippines president, Benigno Aquino, said the agreement reaffirms our countries’ commitment to mutual defense and security, and promotes regional peace and stability.

Both President Obama and I share the conviction that territorial and maritime disputes in the Asia-Pacific region should be settled peacefully, based on international law. We affirm that arbitration is an open, friendly, and peaceful approach to seeking a just and durable solution, he said.

Disputes with China

Anti-China sentiments have been on the rise in the Philippines, which is engaged with Beijing over disputed atolls in the potentially oil- and gas-rich South China Sea, with both countries claiming Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal as their own.

The Philippines has accused Beijing of becoming increasingly aggressive in staking its claims to the sea, and has called on the US for greater military as well as diplomatic support.

While the treaty is seen to boost Manila's confidence in countering the Chinese power, Santiago warned that the country must be careful in handling the agreement, and avoid the violation of the Philippines constitution. 

Filipinos should keep uppermost the supremacy of the Philippine Constitution, she said.

We should not accommodate any foreign power at the cost of the sovereignty of our Constitution, even if the problem is presented as if it were a problem of national survival.

Activists opposing what they call US imperialism in Asia, raise the question of sovereignty.

They cite a case in 2005 when five US soldiers were initially sentenced to life in prison for allegedly raping a Filipino woman, before the ruling was overturned by another court and they were set free, despite public anger.

Another issue that has spiked contempt is the alleged dumping of toxic waste in the northern Philippines, supposedly by US military ships which Washington denies.

'Exaggerated threat'

Jose Maria Sison, the exiled leader of the Communist Party of the Philippines, and one of the top opponents of the deal told Al Jazeera that the agreement practically reopens the US bases in the country. 

The US military bases shall be practically re-established under the guise of facilities built on Philippine military grounds, with the Filipino military personnel practically serving as perimeter security guards and with the Philippine government sharing the costs, he said.

Sison also said the US is exaggerating the threat of Chinese aggression in order to justify its pivot to East Asia while establishing bases in the Philippines and at the same time claiming neutrality between The Philippines and China.

But he also said that China is not helping itself by outlandishly claiming about 90 per cent of the entire South China Sea, including its high seas, and threatening to grab 90 per cent of the exclusive economic zone and 100 per cent of the extended continental shelf of the Philippines.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Dr Francisco Nemenzo, a political scientist and former president of the University of the Philippines, criticised the negotiators for concealing the details of the agreement. 

Nemenzo said the deal just legitimises what they [the US] have been doing all these years: allowing the establishment of an American base within a Philippine base, which a Filipino commander cannot even enter.

We want to know if the deal is a blanket agreement, allowing the US to set up a military facility wherever they want to.

Security around the capital for the two-day visit is tight, including the ordering of a no-fly zone by the Philippine government during the arrival of Air Force Once.

I can tell you the United States is absolutely committed to providing whatever resources and assets that we can, Obama told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.

A U.S. Navy submersible drone scanned a remote patch of the Indian Ocean seabed on Sunday in its so far fruitless efforts to find signs of the missing plane, but bad weather prevented an air and sea surface search.

More than seven weeks after the jet carrying 239 people disappeared enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, and six weeks since the search moved from Asia to the Indian Ocean, authorities are now regrouping to decide how to proceed.

We are currently consulting very closely with our international partners on the best way to continue the search into the future, the Joint Agency Coordination Centre in charge of the search told Reuters in an email.

Malaysia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Britain and the United States are assisting Australia in trying to solve the most expensive search in aviation history.

Obviously we don't know all the details but we do know if in fact the plane went down in the ocean on this part of this world, there is a big place and it is very challenging effort and laboriously effort, Obama said. It is going to take quite some time.

A U.S. defense official told Reuters on Friday that the sea search is likely to drag on for years as it enters the much more difficult phase of scouring broader areas of the ocean near where the plane is believed to have crashed.

Australia and Malaysia are under pressure to bring closure to the grieving families of those on board MH370, which disappeared on March 8, by finding wreckage to determine what happened to the aircraft.

Malaysia is also under growing pressure to improve its disclosure about its investigation, although Obama said on Sunday that U.S. authorities had found it to be fully forthcoming in sharing information. Najib has said his government would make public a preliminary report into the plane's disappearance next week.

Last week Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters that authorities would be increasing the assets that are available for deep-sea search and that his government was seeking help from state oil company Petronas which has expertise in deep-sea exploration.

The empty expanse of water some 1,000 miles northwest of Western Australia's state capital Perth is one of the most remote places in the world and also one of the deepest.

Until now, the undersea search has been focused on a 10 square km (6.2 square mile) circular zone where a series of pings detected earlier this month led authorities to believe the plane's black box flight recorders may be located.

The undersea search is set to be extended beyond this small area if the U.S. Bluefin-21 drone fails to find anything, the search authority said on Saturday.

A source in the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed to the newspaper that Russian authorities are considering such a possibility. However, sources close to the Russian presidential administration said that the final decision has not yet been taken, but “everything is leading up to this.”

“This is an arising retaliatory measure as in current realities it is impossible to find a common language with NATO,” the newspaper cited one of the sources as saying.

According to the report, Russian officials doubt that the information office should continue its work after the foreign ministers of the 28-nation NATO announced on April 1 they were freezing civilian and military cooperation with Russia, in an effort to put further pressure on Russia following its reunification with Crimea.

The move comes after the alliance’s leadership ordered to limit the access of Russian diplomats to its headquarters in Brussels. The Russian Foreign Ministry said the decision reflected the persistent ‘cold war’ mentality among the alliance’s officials.

NATO has yet received no official notifications on the future of its Moscow office, which was opened in February 2001 and housed within the Belgian embassy, a source in the alliance told the newspaper.

NATO announced on April 8 the access to NATO Headquarters would be denied to all representatives of the Russian Mission, except the Russian Ambassador, his Deputy Head of Mission, and two support staff.

“This is an absolutely absurd measure, showing to what extent our NATO partners were not ready for a real dialogue with Moscow,” a source told Kommersant.

Earlier, NATO foreign ministers said they were suspending the practical and military cooperation with Russia amid the situation around Ukraine, but would continue contacts of the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) at the level of ambassadors and higher.

Russian officials have repeatedly said that Moscow was not seeking confrontation with NATO, but was ready to take all political and military measures to ensure its security.

Tensions between Russia and the West rose after the ouster of pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in February, followed by the rise to power of Ukrainian nationalist politicians in the new government in Kiev, which Moscow considers illegitimate.

The two leaders have been at odds over the U.S. National Security Agency's spying habits since revelations from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden last year showed the United States had listened in on many of its allies, including Merkel.

Obama has since banned the practice of eavesdropping on allied political leaders, but the measure has not placated Germany.

We have a few difficulties yet to overcome, Merkel said in a joint news conference with Obama at the White House, referring to the conflict and pointedly declining to say, when asked, that trust between the two nations had been restored.

Snowden's revelations caused indignation in Germany, which is especially sensitive about surveillance after abuse by the Gestapo under the Nazis and by the Stasi in East Germany.

Berlin has pushed in vain for a no-spy agreement with Washington.

Obama said the United States did not have such agreements with any country, friend or foe. He said the United States was working with Germany to work through rules that govern the relationship and to avert misunderstanding.

I think that we have gone a long way in closing some of the gaps, but as Chancellor Merkel said, there's still some gaps that need to be worked through, he said.

Obama said the United States would hold a cyber dialogue with Germany to help address further differences in how their intelligence operations worked. He made clear that the backlash in Berlin, and with Merkel specifically, had affected him personally.

Germany is one of our closest allies and our closest friends. And that's true across the spectrum of issues: security, intelligence, economic, diplomatic, he said.

And Angela Merkel is one of my closest friends on the world stage, and somebody ... whose partnership I deeply value. And so it has pained me to see the degree to which the Snowden disclosures have created strains in the relationship.

ALIGNED ON TRADE

German officials had not expected to obtain concessions from the White House about spying during Merkel's trip.

The two sides were closer on the issue of trade, however. Both Obama and Merkel said they were committed to bridging differences to reach a U.S.-EU trade pact, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

It will be very important for us to bring the negotiations very quickly to a close, Merkel, referring to the talks about the pact, said through a translator.

Europe and the United States see free trade as a way to create more jobs. A deal could boost the EU and U.S. economies by more than $100 billion a year each.

But concerns about food safety and environmental standards, among other issues, have dogged the talks.

Merkel said doubts about the pact had to be overcome.

It's simply necessary, looking at the intensity of the transatlantic partnership and the closeness of our partnership, for us to have this agreement, she said.

Obama noted that TTIP would make it easier to export U.S. natural gas to Europe. The United States is pushing the EU to diversify its energy supplies as a result of the Ukraine crisis, which has highlighted European reliance on Russia for oil and gas. The EU, in turn, has pressed Obama to speed up approvals for U.S. energy exports.

The United States has already approved licenses for natural gas exports, which will increase global supply and benefit partners like Europe, he said. And TTIP would make it even easier to get licenses to export gas to Europe.

Merkel, in remarks later at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the powerful business lobby, said she wanted to wrap up TTIP talks by the end of 2015.

Asked if the Ukraine crisis would slow or stimulate talks, Merkel said: It won't be harder. Whether it will be easier, I don't dare to say yet.

Without a free trade agreement it would take a long time for Europe to get access to American natural gas, she said.

Six CF-18s and hundreds of Canadian Forces personnel left for Romania to help NATO forces in Eastern Europe amid uncertainty over the scope of the mission.


  It is the biggest deployment of military aircraft to Romania from
  another NATO member since the Ukraine crisis broke out.


There is a lot of uncertainty about what we're going to be
  doing over there, Lieutenant-General Yvan Blondin said at a
  press conference with Defense Minister Rob Nicholson in
  Bagotville, where the CF-18 Hornets are based.



  Blondin mentioned that the troops were going to perhaps

  sure what the mission will involve.


We're not sure how long we're going to be staying, but we'll
  be staying until the government tells us it's time to come
  back, Blondin said.



  Six fighters have set off, accompanied by a C-17 cargo plane
  carrying spare parts, tools and mechanical equipment.



  The fighters first headed to Iceland before receiving further
  direction from Department of National Defense's Central Command
  on where they will be stationed in Romania, which borders
  Ukraine.



  All in all, up to 250 Canadian military personnel are set to be
  deployed for the NATO mission.

  jets would join the NATO mission in response to the Ukraine
  crisis.

OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Dunja Mijatovic’s remarks on the situation in Ukraine distort reality and undermines the authority of this international organisation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, April 23.

Moscow has noted “the surprisingly biased analysis of the situation regarding the freedom of the media in Ukraine, which was made by Dunja Mijatovic in an interview to CNN after a visit to that country”, the ministry said.

“The impression is that while announcing her assessments the OSCE representative does not understand or does not want to understand the real causes of the extraordinary danger hanging over the freedom of expression in Ukraine. She mentioned only cursorily more than 200 attacks on journalists on the territory controlled by the Kiev authorities. This is probably the first time after the end of World War Two that representatives of ultra-radical, neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic movements have come to power in Europe. It is not surprising that they have basically imposed political censorship in the country,” the ministry said.

Mijatovic’s position “requires her to conduct an objective review of facts and help solve problems pertaining to the violation of the freedom of the media”, it said.

“In accordance with her mandate, the OSCE representative should have urged those who are holding power in Kiev to begin investigating offences committed against journalists by extremist groups and restrictions on the freedom of the media. Dunja Mijatovic’s mission is to make Kiev correct the situation. She could have publicly demanded during the interview that journalist Konstantin Dolgov, who had been arrested in Kiev under far-fetched pretext, be released,” the ministry said.

Russia “has repeatedly drawn the attention of the authoritative OSCE institution to the essence of the latest developments in Ukraine’s mass media”. “But why does Dunja Mijatovic see the problem elsewhere again, namely in the legitimate wish of the Russian-speaking population in the South-East of Ukraine, which has been cut off by Kiev from Russian television channels, to know the truth? Once again, the OSCE representative mixed up the cause and the effect. Instead of giving an honest assessment of the atmosphere of information intolerance created by Kiev, the CNN viewers for some reason were told about Russian Crimea again,” the ministry said. “And this was done in a distorted manner, ignoring the fact that people had for the first time in history had their linguistic and cultural diversity legitimately recognised and could freely choose the Russian information space where many international channels, including CNN, are available,” the ministry said.

“We would not like to believe that such high-ranking OSCE official is intentionally manipulating facts,” it added.

“Nevertheless, there is the stubborn reluctance to see reality. These actions are not only imposing a distorted perception of the events in Ukraine upon the rest of the world but also undermining the authority of the whole OSCE,” the ministry said.","MOSCOW, April 23. /ITAR-TASS/.

The assault has seen casualties on both sides, and Ukraine's Defense Ministry said that two Mi-24 attack helicopters were shot down and two crew members killed.

A number of amateur videos posted online appear to show the helicopters being attacked. One video, later shared by the pro-Kiev Euromaidan PR account and picked up by the United Kingdom's Channel 4, appears to show a helicopter going down after being shot. The video has been independently verified by Storyful.

Other footage, which appears to have been shot and uploaded to YouTube by a pro-Russian activist, seems to show a helicopter being shot at over a militia checkpoint outside Sloyvansk. 

And one more amateur video appears to show a crowd cheering in Russian as they see a large explosion in the distance, which the person who uploaded the video says is a Ukrainian helicopter crashing.

While it is difficult to conclusively confirm the authenticity of these videos, a representative of Euromaidan PR said they believed all three were authentic. They are just a handful of the many more that have been uploaded to YouTube over the past 12 hours.

The downing of multiple helicopters is being taken as proof that the pro-Russian militias are at least being armed by Russia. The Ukrainian Security Service is saying that at least one helicopter was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, which led Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt to tweet:

Gunmen who turned up at dawn took control of official buildings in Horlivka, a town of almost 300,000 people, said a Reuters photographer. They refused to be photographed.

The heavily armed men wore the same military uniforms without insignia as other unidentified green men who have joined pro-Russian protesters with clubs and chains in seizing control of towns across Ukraine's Donbass coal and steel belt.

Some 30 pro-Russian separatists also seized a city council building in Alchevsk, further east in Luhansk region, Interfax-Ukraine news agency said. They took down the Ukrainian flag and flew a city banner before allowing workers to leave.

Attempts to contain the insurgency by the government in Kiev have proved largely unsuccessful, with security forces repeatedly outmaneuvered by the separatists. The West and the new Ukrainian government accuse Russia of being behind the unrest, a charge Moscow denies.

Daniel Baer, the U.S. ambassador to the OSCE, a European security watchdog which has monitors in the region, told reporters in Vienna: I think it's very clear that what is happening would not be happening without Russian involvement.

A police official in Donetsk, the provincial capital where separatists have declared a People's Republic of Donetsk, said separatists were also in control of the Horlivka police station, having seized the regional police headquarters earlier in April.

The murder of a town councilor from Horlivka who opposed the separatists was cited by Kiev last week among reasons for launching new efforts to regain control of the region.

Wednesday's takeovers followed the fall of the main government buildings on Tuesday further east in Luhansk, capital of Ukraine's easternmost province, driving home just how far control over the densely populated region has slipped from the central government in Kiev.

They've taken them. The government administration and police, the police official said of Horlivka.

SECESSION REFERENDUM

The town sits just north of Donetsk, unofficial capital of the whole Donbass area, where mainly Russian-speaking separatists have called a referendum on secession for May 11.

Many hope to follow Crimea's break from Ukraine in March and subsequent annexation by Russia, following the overthrow of Ukraine's Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in late February in a tug-of-war between the West and Russia over the strategic direction of the former Soviet republic.

The Donbass region is home to giant steel smelters and heavy plants that produce up to a third of Ukraine's industrial output. An armed uprising began there in early April, with Kiev almost powerless to respond for fear of provoking an invasion by tens of thousands of Russian troops massed on the border.

Many Russian-speaking business oligarchs from the Donbass backed Yanukovich and exercise great influence over the region.

On Wednesday, the most powerful of these, Ukraine's richest man Rinat Akhmetov issued a formal statement saying he remained committed to his investments in the Donbass and to keeping the region as part of Ukraine.

Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk warned his ministers their jobs were on the line if the east remained out of reach - The country demands action, he said.

Oleksander Turchinov, Ukraine's acting president until after an election on May 25, reiterated on Wednesday that police were incapable of reasserting control in the region and said the armed forces were on full alert for a Russian invasion.

That prompted a return volley from Moscow, where the Foreign Ministry demanded that Kiev immediately ceases the bellicose rhetoric, which is aimed at intimidating its own population.

There were, however, more conciliatory noises elsewhere.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not do stupid things in response to Western sanctions.

Describing a phone call between President Vladimir Putin and British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Kremlin said they agreed that only peaceful means could resolve the conflict - although Putin has shown little sign of backing down to sanctions.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she ruled out any military solution to the conflict over Ukraine, which is sandwiched between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO bloc:

Would we have learned anything 100 years after the start of World War One and 75 years after the start of World War Two if we resorted to the same methods? No, said Merkel, who will visit U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday. We will not resolve our conflicts in Europe with military means.

Military solutions can be excluded.

SANCTIONS COST

There were further signs on Monday that Russia is paying an economic price for its involvement in Ukraine. The International Monetary Fund said international sanctions imposed on Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine were hurting the economy.

The IMF cut its 2014 growth forecast for Russia to 0.2 percent from 1.3 percent and forecast capital outflows of $100 billion this year.

The IMF mission chief to Russia, Antonio Spilimbergo, also told reporters that Russia was experiencing recession and that a resolution of the Ukraine crisis would significantly reduce Russia's own economic uncertainties.

If you understand by recession two quarters of negative economic growth then Russia is experiencing recession now, Spilimbergo said.

Ukraine is also suffering from the turmoil, with economic output falling 1.1 percent year-on-year in the first three months of 2014, according to government figures released on Wednesday. Gazprom said Ukraine's unpaid bill for gas supplied by the Russian energy giant was now $3.5 billion.

However, the European Union said it was ready to provide economic aid to Ukraine along with the IMF, which on Wednesday approved a $17-billion aid package, including an immediate disbursement of $3.2 billion.

  14 people have asked for medical assistance, with several
  hospitalized, after clashes in Donetsk, the regional
  administration told Interfax-Ukraine news agency.
  
  According to Novosti Donbassa (Donbas News), eight people have
  been taken to the city’s Kalinin hospital after violence broke
  out.
  
  The website also reports of a policeman being shell-shocked due
  to handmade grenade exploding near him.



  Pro- and-anti-Kiev protest rallies took place simultaneously in
  the city.



  According to RT’s stringer Graham Phillips, there were plenty of
  masked young men on both sides, and they were clearly looking for
  a fight.



  The police failed to contain the crowd as protesters clashed with
  each other, using firecrackers, smoke grenades, baseball bats and
  sticks.



  A group of about 1,000 “neo-Nazi thugs” has come to Donetsk from
  Dnepropetrovsk on Monday to cause provocations, the press-service
  of the self-proclaimed People’s Republic of Donetsk told RT.
  “We were expecting an attack. We had objective information.
  Really, the guys arrived with baseball bats, sticks and rods.
  Those were the ultras from Dnepropetrovsk, FC Dnipro
  Dnipropetrovsk supporters. According to our info, there were also
  people from FC Dynamo Kyiv fan base. I have no information of any
  Right Sector involvement,” Vitaly Ivanov, a press-service
  member, who was at the scene, stressed.
  
  Initially, there were about 200 local anti-Kiev activists, who
  went out “to meet them halfway in order to regain the
  initiative”, he said.
  
  “More and more people joined us at an incredible pace as we made
  our way… When we reached them [pro-Kiev radicals], there were
  around 1,000 of us,” Ivanov said.
  
  According to him, the ultras were “surrounded by the police,
  which was brought, especially, for the occasion” as the
  officers on the scene were from Kirovograd region, but not from
  the Donetsk force.
  “We were received with aggression. Smoke grenades were thrown
  at us. Several people got injured. Then there were a couple of
  small scuffles with the ultras. And then they just dispersed.
  They didn’t expect such a rebuff; that there’ll be so many of
  us,” he said.



  There were around 2,000 pro-Kiev demonstrators, who were marching

  14 people have asked for medical assistance, with several
  hospitalized, after clashes in Donetsk, the regional
  administration told Interfax-Ukraine news agency.
  
  According to Novosti Donbassa (Donbas News), eight people have
  been taken to the city’s Kalinin hospital after violence broke
  out.
  
  The website also reports of a policeman being shell-shocked due
  to handmade grenade exploding near him.



  Pro- and-anti-Kiev protest rallies took place simultaneously in
  the city.



  According to RT’s stringer Graham Phillips, there were plenty of
  masked young men on both sides, and they were clearly looking for
  a fight.



  The police failed to contain the crowd as protesters clashed with
  each other, using firecrackers, smoke grenades, baseball bats and
  sticks.



  A group of about 1,000 “neo-Nazi thugs” has come to Donetsk from
  Dnepropetrovsk on Monday to cause provocations, the press-service
  of the self-proclaimed People’s Republic of Donetsk told RT.
  “We were expecting an attack. We had objective information.
  Really, the guys arrived with baseball bats, sticks and rods.
  Those were the ultras from Dnepropetrovsk, FC Dnipro
  Dnipropetrovsk supporters. According to our info, there were also
  people from FC Dynamo Kyiv fan base. I have no information of any
  Right Sector involvement,” Vitaly Ivanov, a press-service
  member, who was at the scene, stressed.
  
  Initially, there were about 200 local anti-Kiev activists, who
  went out “to meet them halfway in order to regain the
  initiative”, he said.
  
  “More and more people joined us at an incredible pace as we made
  our way… When we reached them [pro-Kiev radicals], there were
  around 1,000 of us,” Ivanov said.
  
  According to him, the ultras were “surrounded by the police,
  which was brought, especially, for the occasion” as the
  officers on the scene were from Kirovograd region, but not from
  the Donetsk force.
  “We were received with aggression. Smoke grenades were thrown
  at us. Several people got injured. Then there were a couple of
  small scuffles with the ultras. And then they just dispersed.
  They didn’t expect such a rebuff; that there’ll be so many of
  us,” he said.



  There were around 2,000 pro-Kiev demonstrators, who were marching
  on one of the main streets of the city, RT’s Paula Slier reports
  from Donetsk.
  
  When they crossed paths with a smaller rally of anti-government

Seven officers from the observer team and their translator were brought into a room of waiting journalists in the separatist-held administration building in the city of Slovyansk on Sunday. 

Guards in camouflage fatigues and balaclavas, carrying Kalashnikov rifles, were also in the room as journalists spoke to the observers.

Colonel Axel Schneider from Germany, who appeared nervous as he spoke for the group, stressed they were on a diplomatic mission under the auspices of the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) when they were detained on Friday and were not spying for NATO as the separatists claim.

Schneider said he understood that the self-proclaimed city mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, could use the observers as a bargaining chip.

Later, one of the men, a Swedish national, was released by the group on medical grounds.

He has a mild form of diabetes and so we decided to let him go, Stella Korosheva, a spokeswoman for the separatist mayor told reporters.

Ponomaryov said on Saturday that they could be released in exchange for jailed pro-Russia activists and told reporters that he was heading into talks with the mediators.

In our town, where a war situation is going on, any military personnel who don't have our permission are considered prisoners of war, he told reporters.

Ponomaryov said he was preparing to meet OSCE mediators to negotiate the terms of the group's release.

The mayor of this city granted us his protection and he regarded us as his guests, Schneider told journalists in Slovyansk in eastern Ukraine.

We were accommodated in a cellar. We had to set up conditions for ourselves, said Schneider, describing what happened after they were seized. Since yesterday we've been in a more comfortable room with heating. We have daylight, and an air conditioner.

I can tell you that the word of the mayor is a word of honour. We have not been touched.

Schneider told reporters that none of the European delegation were sick.

We have no indication when we will be sent home to our countries, Schneider said. We wish from the bottom of our hearts to go back to our nations as soon and as quickly as possible.

Ponomaryov, who was wearing a pistol in a holster and was escorted by two armed bodyguards, claimed in the interview that the OSCE observers are not our hostages -- they are our guests.

Asked about Russia's promise to do everything it could to convince the pro-Kremlin rebels in Slovyansk to release the OSCE military observers, Ponomaryov said he had no direct contact with Moscow.

Captured officers

Ponomaryov also said that pro-Russian separatists had separately arrested three Ukrainian officers, a colonel, a major and a captain, he said had been sent towards Slovyansk on a spying mission.

There were a total of seven in their group and we arrested three of them. We will swiftly get the four others, he said.

Footage has emerged showing the three captured officers bearing signs of torture, being paraded before the media in Slovyansk.

Ukraine's SBU security service confirmed the three officers had been seized. The rebel mayor said there would be no contact with Kiev over the imprisoned Ukrainians because the pro-Kremlin separatists see the capital's Western-backed government as illegitimate.

There will be no contact with Kiev, only through the intermediary of the OSCE, he said. Ukraine's authorities, he said, understand only the language of force.

Moscow is surprised by the distorted interpretation of the Geneva statement by the Kiev authorities and their American partners, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, April 23.

Russia “continues to believe in the seriousness of our Western partners when they speak about their commitment to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the political crisis in Ukraine. However fact, alas, prove otherwise. We are still waiting for Kiev to fulfill its promises as it is responsible for fostering dialogue with Ukrainian regions, including in the South-East,” the ministry said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier this week urged Kiev to “cancel orders on use of army against the population, to disarm Right Sector militants and other ultranationalist groups, release protesters in the south-eastern regions from detention and stop their prosecution, and launch a comprehensive constitutional reform by taking real steps not by making declarations”.

Lavrov said that the Ukrainian authorities were not complying with the Geneva agreement.

”Buildings in Kiev which were seized by force at the start of the events in Ukraine have not been vacated, the streets have not been unblocked and the ‘Maidan’ [general term meaning public protests against the authorities] continues to ‘boom’, excuse the term. The leaders appointed by the Verkhovna Rada [parliament] are saying openly that the Geneva agreement does not apply to the ‘Maidan’ because the Kiev City Council or city administration has made the decision that the ‘Maidan’ may stay on and that it is legitimate. This is absolutely unacceptable,” the minister said.

The Geneva meeting on the situation in Ukraine on April 17 agreed on initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all citizens.

All sides must refrain from any violence, intimidation or provocative actions. The participants strongly condemned and rejected all expressions of extremism, racism and religious intolerance, including anti-Semitism.

All illegal armed groups must be disarmed; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners; all illegally occupied streets, squares and other public places in Ukrainian cities and towns must be vacated.

Amnesty will be granted to protestors and to those who have left buildings and other public places and surrendered weapons, with the exception of those found guilty of capital crimes.

It was agreed that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission should play a leading role in assisting Ukrainian authorities and local communities in the immediate implementation of these de-escalation measures wherever they are needed most, beginning in the coming days. The USA, EU and Russia commit to support this mission, in particular, by providing observers.

The announced constitutional process will be inclusive, transparent and accountable. It will include the immediate establishment of a broad national dialogue, with outreach to all of Ukraine’s regions and political constituencies, and allow for the consideration of public comments and proposed amendments.

The participants underlined the importance of economic and financial stability in Ukraine and would be ready to discuss additional support as the above steps are implemented.","MOSCOW, April 23. /ITAR-TASS/.

The US needed to minimize military spending costs, so NATO’s purpose in Syria, Libya and Iraq was to get EU states to contribute to the US military program, Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri, Michael Hudson, told RT.

RT:Germany has very close economic ties to
  Russia, but it's coming under huge American pressure to act. But
  if Berlin brings about sanctions, won't they simple shoot
  themselves in the foot?

Michael Hudson: Obviously there are two
  different views within Germany, because of the close links they
  don’t want to do anything that is going to disturb the
  relationship with Russia. But there has been a large confusion
  over what just NATO is about and about what the German
  contribution to NATO is about. NATO for the last 30 years has not
  been about defending Europe. Obviously nobody thinks there is
  going to be any invasion of Europe from anyone – not from Cuba,
  Russia or Brazil. The purpose of NATO from the American point of
  view was burden sharing. Since the 1960s and 1970s military
  spending has been the single major cause of the US balance and
  payment deficits. So within Congress and within the Pentagon
  there was a discussion on how we are going to minimize the
  balance and payment costs of our military spending in Asia,
  Europe and the Near East. The answer was burden sharing. And the
  purpose of involving NATO in Syria, Libya and Iraq, which have
  nothing to do with North Atlantic at all, is basically to get
  Germany and France and other European countries to contribute to
  the American military program.



  This is a tension felt in Germany, France and other countries
  now, but especially on the German Die Linke party and some of the
  social democrats who say “Why should we, Europeans, be taxed
  to pay for the American military program and strategy when we
  don’t have really any voice in forming it?” They are saying
  “no taxation without representation” virtually, they are
  saying “Why should we, Europeans, be taxed for NATO’s tax
  gathering program.” They fund the American military not only
  in the Near East but now also adventures in Ukraine that is very
  much against the European tradition. The European arguments in
  the press are “We want to support the elected
  governments” but the Obama Administration says “Well,
  we’ll redefine democracy. Democracy is not an elected government,
  it is not an elected government in Libya, in Iraq and Ukraine.
  Democracy is a country that appoints leaders who the American
  government will approve off and who will agree to impose
  neo-liberal policies.”

RT:White House press secretary Jay Carney
  admitted that the sanctions will impact the global economy as
  well as hurt Russia. Only a few years after the global economic
  crisis, how wise is it to upset the economy again? Won’t it be
  very harmful for states like Germany that has strong economic
  ties with Russia?

MH: The Germans are very clear they are not
  going to pursue sanctions that hurt German industry. That would
  be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. And there is some
  discussion in Germany whether they do really want to remain part
  of NATO. If they don’t really have a voice in it, do they really
  need to sacrifice German industry so that American industry moves
  in and takes over the markets that German industry has. This is
  an American market grabbing opportunity from Germany, and you can
  be sure that within Merkel’s only Christian-Democratic party
  there is a big argument over whether Germany should make a
  sacrifice of its industry for American industry just because
  America says so.


RT:Will John Kerry's seeming attempt to
  shift some of the blame for what's happening in Ukraine onto the
  EU impact the talks?

MH: I don’t think the Europeans pay more
  attention to John Kerry than the Americans do. He is basically
  making these speeches for the American electorate, not to the
  Europeans to pay attention. Kerry is a new sort of Tony Blair.



  He [Kerry] is trying to frame the situation but again, not many
  people are paying attention. Most people say “What is
  actually the stake? War is basically financial today?” And
  you could say “Wars are financed by other means” or
  “Finances war by other means” and then they realize that
  all this juggling over Ukraine is basically financial, not only
  between the West and Russia but between America and Europe. And
  all this can do is spur a pullback on the part of Europe, saying
  “Wait a minute, we are pushing for our own interests, not for
  American national interests.” Again, what it is doing is
  dividing NATO and making Europeans ask “Is there any real
  reason for NATO anymore?”

RT:What are the possible consequences of
  the sanctions against Russia, what do you think?

MH: One consequence will be within Russia
  itself. It will realize the need that it must be much more
  self-sufficient and it will have to reduce its dependency on the
  West and develop much more industrialization. Russia under the
  World Trade Organization rules is able to sue the US in the
  International court. And I believe as I have already said that it
  can soon recover from any damages. And it would be able to
  recover from these damages by moving against American investments
  in Russia. So the ramifications could be on America itself. It
  cannot be good for the foreign investors in Russia, and what
  Russia can also do is decide to pursue a tax policy that will tax
  resource rent, mineral rent, land rent and most of the rent that
  is now being used to generate income, to pay dividends to foreign
  stockholders. Russia has a very wide range of policies that it
  can do to resist the sanctions, to be more self-sufficient and
  basically the effects will not be positive for the US, they will
  be the exact opposite of what the US is trying to bring about,
  which is more Russian dependency on the West.


RT:Edward Snowden revealed the US had been
  spying on Europe, including Merkel herself, for years. In fact,
  the Chancellor even had her request to see her file rejected. Is
  she really prepared to sweep this under the carpet, and for
  what?

MH: Absolutely not. Merkel is from East Germany
  and they grew up under the Stasi listening to them all the time.
  And anyone who grew up in East Germany was so traumatized by the
  tapping of the phones, by the constant surveillance, that this is
  not something they can get out of the system. All this was
  sudden, like her eyes were open, saying “The Americans are
  acting like the new Stasi.” This is everything that she has
  spent her life fighting against and that was a shock to the
  system that has led her to doubt in everything the US is doing.
  She doesn’t want to come out and contradict the President of the
  United States on her visit here but it makes her very worried
  about any kind of demands that the US will make on her. And it is
  beholden on her to back and support German industry and German
  tax payers against the demands that Obama is making that Germany
  fund NATO for much more and helping the American producers to
  outcompete German producers and take the markets away from
  Germany.

  going to be any invasion of Europe from anyone – not from Cuba,
  Russia or Brazil. The purpose of NATO from the American point of
  view was burden sharing. Since the 1960s and 1970s military
  spending has been the single major cause of the US balance and
  payment deficits. So within Congress and within the Pentagon
  there was a discussion on how we are going to minimize the
  balance and payment costs of our military spending in Asia,
  Europe and the Near East. The answer was burden sharing. And the
  purpose of involving NATO in Syria, Libya and Iraq, which have
  nothing to do with North Atlantic at all, is basically to get
  Germany and France and other European countries to contribute to
  the American military program.



  This is a tension felt in Germany, France and other countries
  now, but especially on the German Die Linke party and some of the
  social democrats who say “Why should we, Europeans, be taxed
  to pay for the American military program and strategy when we
  don’t have really any voice in forming it?” They are saying
  “no taxation without representation” virtually, they are
  saying “Why should we, Europeans, be taxed for NATO’s tax
  gathering program.” They fund the American military not only
  in the Near East but now also adventures in Ukraine that is very
  much against the European tradition. The European arguments in
  the press are “We want to support the elected
  governments” but the Obama Administration says “Well,
  we’ll redefine democracy. Democracy is not an elected government,
  it is not an elected government in Libya, in Iraq and Ukraine.
  Democracy is a country that appoints leaders who the American
  government will approve off and who will agree to impose
  neo-liberal policies.”

RT:White House press secretary Jay Carney
  admitted that the sanctions will impact the global economy as
  well as hurt Russia. Only a few years after the global economic
  crisis, how wise is it to upset the economy again? Won’t it be
  very harmful for states like Germany that has strong economic
  ties with Russia?

MH: The Germans are very clear they are not
  going to pursue sanctions that hurt German industry. That would
  be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. And there is some
  discussion in Germany whether they do really want to remain part
  of NATO. If they don’t really have a voice in it, do they really
  need to sacrifice German industry so that American industry moves
  in and takes over the markets that German industry has. This is
  an American market grabbing opportunity from Germany, and you can
  be sure that within Merkel’s only Christian-Democratic party
  there is a big argument over whether Germany should make a
  sacrifice of its industry for American industry just because
  America says so.


RT:Will John Kerry's seeming attempt to
  shift some of the blame for what's happening in Ukraine onto the
  EU impact the talks?

MH: I don’t think the Europeans pay more
  attention to John Kerry than the Americans do. He is basically
  making these speeches for the American electorate, not to the
  Europeans to pay attention. Kerry is a new sort of Tony Blair.



  He [Kerry] is trying to frame the situation but again, not many
  people are paying attention. Most people say “What is
  actually the stake? War is basically financial today?” And
  you could say “Wars are financed by other means” or
  “Finances war by other means” and then they realize that
  all this juggling over Ukraine is basically financial, not only
  between the West and Russia but between America and Europe. And
  all this can do is spur a pullback on the part of Europe, saying
  “Wait a minute, we are pushing for our own interests, not for
  American national interests.” Again, what it is doing is
  dividing NATO and making Europeans ask “Is there any real
  reason for NATO anymore?”

RT:What are the possible consequences of
  the sanctions against Russia, what do you think?

MH: One consequence will be within Russia
  itself. It will realize the need that it must be much more
  self-sufficient and it will have to reduce its dependency on the
  West and develop much more industrialization. Russia under the
  World Trade Organization rules is able to sue the US in the
  International court. And I believe as I have already said that it
  can soon recover from any damages. And it would be able to
  recover from these damages by moving against American investments
  in Russia. So the ramifications could be on America itself. It
  cannot be good for the foreign investors in Russia, and what
  Russia can also do is decide to pursue a tax policy that will tax
  resource rent, mineral rent, land rent and most of the rent that
  is now being used to generate income, to pay dividends to foreign
  stockholders. Russia has a very wide range of policies that it
  can do to resist the sanctions, to be more self-sufficient and
  basically the effects will not be positive for the US, they will
  be the exact opposite of what the US is trying to bring about,
  which is more Russian dependency on the West.


RT:Edward Snowden revealed the US had been
  spying on Europe, including Merkel herself, for years. In fact,
  the Chancellor even had her request to see her file rejected. Is
  she really prepared to sweep this under the carpet, and for
  what?

MH: Absolutely not. Merkel is from East Germany
  and they grew up under the Stasi listening to them all the time.
  And anyone who grew up in East Germany was so traumatized by the
  tapping of the phones, by the constant surveillance, that this is
  not something they can get out of the system. All this was
  sudden, like her eyes were open, saying “The Americans are
  acting like the new Stasi.” This is everything that she has
  spent her life fighting against and that was a shock to the
  system that has led her to doubt in everything the US is doing.
  She doesn’t want to come out and contradict the President of the
  United States on her visit here but it makes her very worried
  about any kind of demands that the US will make on her. And it is
  beholden on her to back and support German industry and German
  tax payers against the demands that Obama is making that Germany
  fund NATO for much more and helping the American producers to
  outcompete German producers and take the markets away from
  Germany.

CLARISSA WARD: Hi, good morning. We were stopped at a checkpoint just outside the city of Slovyansk where we were trying to go because the Ukrainian military had allegedly started an operation to dismantle some of the pro-Russian separatists who were in the town.

We were stopped and told that the commander needed to ask his commander whether we should either be let go or taken prisoner. From there we were then taken to another nearby tent where we were blindfolded with sort of cloth and masking tape, really quite tightly bound around our heads so we couldn’t see anything at all.

We were then bundled into a vehicle and taken to another location. When we got out of the car there, they were quite rough and quite sharp with us. There was a woman shouting at us not to speak at all. We had to have our hands in the air and put them against the wall. People went through all of our belongings - you know, everything, and put it into bags, which they did give back to us later. But they took our earrings, they took our passports. Then the women were separated. Myself and producer were taken to a separate area and they appeared to have a video camera from what I could hear – although obviously I couldn’t see anything and they were asking, “do you have family?” and “why are you here?” and “where are you from?” Of course when you’re asked in that situation whether you have family, and they were like, “do you have children?,” and “who is your family?,” you start to feel a little pit in your stomach because it’s not clear which direction things are going in.

Our male colleagues were in a different area. One of them was beaten. But then men who were holding us kept telling us not to be frightened and that everything would be ok.

Russia is struck by the complacence of the West following violence by pro-Kiev radicals in Odessa, the Russian Ambassador to the UN has said. While the West has condemned the unrest, it has stopped short of pointing the finger at its culprits.


  Following an emergency meeting with the UN Security Council on
  Friday night in connection with the fire at Odessa’s Trade Unions
  House that killed 39 people, Ambassador Vitaly Churkin spoke out
  against Western support of radical elements in Ukraine.
  
  “We were struck by the complacence of the Western members of the
  Security Council towards the actions, including the use of force,
  by the illegitimate Kiev authorities and the ultra-radicals they
  rely on,” said Churkin in a statement.
  
  He added Russia was “profoundly disturbed” by reports
  “thugs” from the extremist, right-wing group Right
  Sector had set the Trade Unions building ablaze.
  “Such actions are reminiscent of the crimes of the
  Nazis,” he said, stressing it is not surprising such
  elements believe they can act with “impunity” when they
  have the backing of the West.
  
  Although the West has moved to condemn the incident, it has
  stopped short of acknowledging it was pro-Kiev radicals that set
  the building ablaze and the victims were pro-federalization
  activists.
  
  The US State Department issued a statement following the event,
  decrying the violence and mayhem that led to so many senseless
  deaths and injuries as “unacceptable.” It made no
  mention of the actions of radical, right-wing elements in
  Ukraine. Sweden’s Foreign Minister went one step further,
  intimating in a Twitter post that the events in Odessa were
  triggered by a “pro-Russian attempt to get control of
  buildings.”

Navalny, who is serving a five-year suspended sentence on a theft conviction he says was Putin's revenge for his opposition, could be jailed for years if found guilty of stealing more than 30 million roubles ($840,200) from two companies through fraud.

But the judge's decision to prolong his house arrest instead of moving him to a detention facility, as prosecutors and prison authorities had requested, suggests the Kremlin is concerned that jailing him could cause protests.

After gaining prominence with an on-line crusade against the corruption that he says permeates Putin's government, Navalny emerged from a wave of street protests in 2011-2012 as Russia's most popular opposition leader.

Ukrainian radical neo-fascist Right Sector group has moved its main headquarters from Kiev to Dnepropetrovsk to “closely monitor” the developments in the east, its leader said, announcing the formation of yet another paramilitary squadron in Ukraine.

“I moved my headquarters to Dnepropetrovsk. The purpose is to
  prevent the spread of the Kremlin infection,” Ukrainian
  presidential candidate and Right Sector leader Dmitry Yarosh
  announced at a press conference in Dnepropetrovsk.



  He says the vital industrial city in Ukraine, Dnepropetrovsk
  provides a better platform to observe the situation in Donbass
  where pro-federalization protests are flourishing, after the coup
  in Kiev.



  Yarosh, placed by Russia on an international most wanted
  terrorist list, also announced that he started forming a special
  squad of fighters called “Donbass.”


“We coordinate all of our actions with the leadership of the
  National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, the Ministry of
  Internal Affairs and Security service of Ukraine,” Yarosh
  said.



  Local media reports that the unit will comprise about 800
  fighters. Any military trained adults could volunteer to join the
  unit, as long as they meet the requirements.



  The move follows a similar announcement in Dnepropetrovsk region,
  whose Kiev-appointed governor and oligarch Igor Kolomoysky
  recently formed a special battalion “Dnepr” formed of
  “local patriots of Ukraine.”


  Both battalions are part of the special force which is being
  formed to stabilize and take the situation under control in the
  eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, as announced earlier by
  Ukraine’s coup-installed millionaire turned Interior minister
  Arsen Avakov.


“The new structure of special divisions of the Ministry of
  Internal Affairs is the answer to saboteurs, ‘green little men’
  and to the other gangs tasked with attacking statehood and
  integrity of Ukraine,” Avakov said earlier in April, stating
  his ministry was ready to employ and legalize as many as 12,000 volunteers across the country.



  On Wednesday, in an exclusive interview to RT, Russia Foreign
  Minister Sergey Lavrov, once again reiterated the worrying
  expansion of the Right Sector. He sees the existence and the
  expansion of the neo-Nazi group as a violation of last week's
  Geneva accords.


“In Geneva we agreed that there must be total rejection of
  extremists and the Right Sector is still very active, and after
  Geneva the Right Sector staged provocations killing several
  people in the vicinity of Slavyansk during Easter Sunday. So
  nothing which was agreed in Geneva and which certainly is for the
  authorities in Kiev to start implementing was done by them,”
  Lavrov said.



  In response to Yarosh's announcement, the mayor of Slovyansk
  Vyacheslav Ponomarev told Gazeta that formation of such a
  battalion “could lead to a fratricidal war.”


  The leader of the Ukrainian radical group, Right Sector Dmitry
  Yarosh, was placed on an international wanted list in March and charged with inciting
  terrorism.



  Yarosh, who leads the far-right militant Right Sector group, has
  always been anti-Russian in his statements, calling for the
  destruction and division of the “Moscow Empire” and
  openly supporting Chechen militants and Georgian aggression.
  Yarosh believes that Russia is Ukraine’s “eternal foe”
  and that a war between the two countries is
  “inevitable.”


  The Right Sector was formed in November 2013 soon after the
  anti-government protests in Ukraine began. Members of the radical
  movement were very active in the violent events which led to the
  ouster of President Viktor Yanukovich.



  The group has been referred to as the most active, the most
  radical and the best organized group in the Ukrainian unrest.
  Many of its violent acts have been well-documented by media and
  in videos posted on YouTube.","Ukraine’s far-right leader moves HQ to the east, forms new squadron

  Ukrainian forces must respect international standards on use of
  force, Amnesty International said on its website responding to
  reports of fatal shootings
  of anti-government activists at several checkpoints in Slavyansk.
  “International standards on the use of force and firearms are
  clear – law enforcement officials should resort to the use of
  firearms only in defence against an imminent threat of death or
  serious injury. They should apply other non-violent means before
  resorting to the use of force, and the use of firearms must
  always be the last resort. When the use of force and firearms is
  unavoidable they must exercise restraint and take steps to
  minimize damage and injury and preserve life,” Heather
  McGill, Ukraine Researcher at Amnesty International, has said.
  
  Amnesty stressed that “an independent, impartial
  investigation should be launched into the events leading up to
  today’s reported loss of life at checkpoints around
  Slavyansk,” adding that “if it is found the Ukrainian
  forces violated international standards and resorted to arbitrary
  or abusive use of force, they must be brought to justice.”

Obama has since banned the practice of eavesdropping on allied political leaders, but the measure has not placated Germany.

We have a few difficulties yet to overcome, Merkel said in a joint news conference with Obama at the White House, referring to the conflict and pointedly declining to say, when asked, that trust between the two nations had been restored.

Snowden's revelations caused indignation in Germany, which is especially sensitive about surveillance after abuse by the Gestapo under the Nazis and by the Stasi in East Germany.

Berlin has pushed in vain for a no-spy agreement with Washington.

Obama said the United States did not have such agreements with any country, friend or foe. He said the United States was working with Germany to work through rules that govern the relationship and to avert misunderstanding.

I think that we have gone a long way in closing some of the gaps, but as Chancellor Merkel said, there's still some gaps that need to be worked through, he said.

Obama said the United States would hold a cyber dialogue with Germany to help address further differences in how their intelligence operations worked. He made clear that the backlash in Berlin, and with Merkel specifically, had affected him personally.

Germany is one of our closest allies and our closest friends. And that's true across the spectrum of issues: security, intelligence, economic, diplomatic, he said.

And Angela Merkel is one of my closest friends on the world stage, and somebody ... whose partnership I deeply value. And so it has pained me to see the degree to which the Snowden disclosures have created strains in the relationship.

ALIGNED ON TRADE

German officials had not expected to obtain concessions from the White House about spying during Merkel's trip.

The two sides were closer on the issue of trade, however. Both Obama and Merkel said they were committed to bridging differences to reach a U.S.-EU trade pact, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

It will be very important for us to bring the negotiations very quickly to a close, Merkel, referring to the talks about the pact, said through a translator.

Europe and the United States see free trade as a way to create more jobs. A deal could boost the EU and U.S. economies by more than $100 billion a year each.

But concerns about food safety and environmental standards, among other issues, have dogged the talks.

Merkel said doubts about the pact had to be overcome.

It's simply necessary, looking at the intensity of the transatlantic partnership and the closeness of our partnership, for us to have this agreement, she said.

Obama noted that TTIP would make it easier to export U.S. natural gas to Europe. The United States is pushing the EU to diversify its energy supplies as a result of the Ukraine crisis, which has highlighted European reliance on Russia for oil and gas. The EU, in turn, has pressed Obama to speed up approvals for U.S. energy exports.

The United States has already approved licenses for natural gas exports, which will increase global supply and benefit partners like Europe, he said. And TTIP would make it even easier to get licenses to export gas to Europe.

Merkel, in remarks later at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the powerful business lobby, said she wanted to wrap up TTIP talks by the end of 2015.

Asked if the Ukraine crisis would slow or stimulate talks, Merkel said: It won't be harder. Whether it will be easier, I don't dare to say yet.

Without a free trade agreement it would take a long time for Europe to get access to American natural gas, she said.
