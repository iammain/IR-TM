"The conversation is continuing quite regularly. The previous conversation between the two presidents took place last week" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Echo of Moscow radio station. "There are a lot of disagreements now and therefore these dialogues are sometimes very tough but nevertheless communication is continuing." Some Western media had earlier reported that Putin and Obama had severed their "direct contacts" because of the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Russia's Federal Migration Service said Friday the country has introduced border control on the crossing points between its newly-adopted republic of Crimea and Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of attempting to "capture" Ukraine for geopolitical projects while U.S. State Secretary John Kerry accused Russia of refusing to take "a single concrete step in the right direction" in the past seven days. The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations agreed Friday night to impose more sanctions on Russia over its "inaction" in easing the tension in eastern Ukraine. Also on Friday acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk accused Russia of violating the compromise Geneva agreement and urged the international community to unite their efforts to secure peace in the world. The standoff between Russia and Ukraine peaked on Thursday when Russia began drills near the border with Ukraine in response to Kiev's "anti-terror" operation which left five pro-Moscow protesters dead.

"Culture is the main essence uniting a nation. It doesn't much matter what is his formal ethnicity. What's important is how a person identifies himself" Putin told his cultural adviser Vladimir Tolstoy during a meeting. "In this sense it's very important for us to create a single cultural space" he said adding culture should play a historic role in the current complicated international environment. Tolstoy echoed Putin's opinion saying provocative appeals which could have led to isolation were very dangerous. "Talented people may have different points of view but it is important that the foundations of national cultural policy unite people" the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. The advisor added that culture could become an instrument of soft power and proposed that the national cultural program must have in its core that "Russia is neither Europe nor Asia." Putin set up the Arts and Culture Council in 2004 to develop principles of state policy in the field of culture with Tolstoy serving the Council's secretary. The Russian government repeatedly underlined importance of " soft power" and of respect to national traditions in the modern world. In March Russian Foreign Ministry voiced concern over the UN Human Rights Council saying that "implementation of human rights must take into account traditions cultural and historical characteristics" of a country. Last July Putin said that Russia must be able to respond adequately on "soft power" use by other countries.

The announcement came as Moscow staged military drills on the joint border with Ukraine Thursday. In announcement the G7 nations urged Russia to join efforts to seek a "diplomatic resolution" of the crisis. WASHINGTON April 25 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations agreed Friday night to impose more sanctions on Russia over its "inaction" in easing the tension in eastern Ukraine. "We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia" said a joint statement issued by leaders of Britain Canada France Germany Italy Japan and the United States plus the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission. The announcement came as Moscow staged military drills on the joint border with Ukraine Thursday responding to Kiev's "anti-terror" operation that resulted in the deaths of five pro-Moscow protesters. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday it was Kiev not implementing the agreement and that Moscow had been eager to assist in the de-escalation of tension as agreed in last week's Geneva deal. The minister accused the West of attempting to "capture" Ukraine for geopolitical ambitions rather than the interests of the Ukrainian people. In Friday's announcement the G7 nations urged Russia to join efforts to seek a "diplomatic resolution" of the crisis threatening "broader coordinated sanctions" including sectoral measures in the event of further "destabilizing" moves from Russia. The United States and EU had hit dozens of Russians and pro-Russia Ukrainians including close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin with travel bans and asset freezes following Moscow's annexation of Crimea last month. However the 28-member bloc remains divided over full trade and economic sanctions against Russia considering the huge gas supplies from the country and their broad economic ties.
