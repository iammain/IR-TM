"Culture is the main essence uniting a nation. It doesn't much matter what is his formal ethnicity. What's important is how a person identifies himself" Putin told his cultural adviser Vladimir Tolstoy during a meeting. "In this sense it's very important for us to create a single cultural space" he said adding culture should play a historic role in the current complicated international environment. Tolstoy echoed Putin's opinion saying provocative appeals which could have led to isolation were very dangerous. "Talented people may have different points of view but it is important that the foundations of national cultural policy unite people" the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. The advisor added that culture could become an instrument of soft power and proposed that the national cultural program must have in its core that "Russia is neither Europe nor Asia." Putin set up the Arts and Culture Council in 2004 to develop principles of state policy in the field of culture with Tolstoy serving the Council's secretary. The Russian government repeatedly underlined importance of " soft power" and of respect to national traditions in the modern world. In March Russian Foreign Ministry voiced concern over the UN Human Rights Council saying that "implementation of human rights must take into account traditions cultural and historical characteristics" of a country. Last July Putin said that Russia must be able to respond adequately on "soft power" use by other countries.

WASHINGTON April 25 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations agreed Friday night to impose more sanctions on Russia over its "inaction" in easing the tension in eastern Ukraine. "We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia" said a joint statement issued by leaders of Britain Canada France Germany Italy Japan and the United States plus the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission. The announcement came as Moscow staged military drills on the joint border with Ukraine Thursday responding to Kiev's "anti-terror" operation that resulted in the deaths of five pro-Moscow protesters. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday it was Kiev not implementing the agreement and that Moscow had been eager to assist in the de-escalation of tension as agreed in last week's Geneva deal. The minister accused the West of attempting to "capture" Ukraine for geopolitical ambitions rather than the interests of the Ukrainian people. In Friday's announcement the G7 nations urged Russia to join efforts to seek a "diplomatic resolution" of the crisis threatening "broader coordinated sanctions" including sectoral measures in the event of further "destabilizing" moves from Russia. The United States and EU had hit dozens of Russians and pro-Russia Ukrainians including close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin with travel bans and asset freezes following Moscow's annexation of Crimea last month.

In a telephone conversation with his U.S. counterpart Chuck Hagel Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the Western military activity had been growing substantially and was "accompanied by provocative statements." Shoigu's remarks came after NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said earlier that the bloc had decided to take "further military measures" to respond to the crisis in Ukraine. Rasmussen said the alliance's aircraft would fly more sorties over the Baltic region and ships would be deployed to the Baltic Sea the eastern Mediterranean and elsewhere. Shoigu denied allegations that Russian special troops had been infiltrating into the Ukrainian territory. "Anti-Russian hysteria that was recently unleashed in the Western media would not help subdue these emotions" the Russian Defense Ministry's press service quoted Shoigu as saying. He also said two fly-bys of Russian jet fighters around a U.S. warship and a warplane in April had been "misinterpreted" by the West. A Russian SU-24 fighter jet flew over the U.S. destroyer Donald Cook 12 times in the Black Sea on April 12. A SU-27 approached the U.S. RC-135 plane over Okhotsk Sea on April 22. Also on Tuesday Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the new package of U.S. sanctions levied against Russia will negatively affect the country's high-tech industry. "The gravity of these measures is absolutely obvious especially in terms of restricting cooperation in high technologies deliveries of dual-purpose products from the United States to Russia and issues linked with launches of U.S.-made spacecraft" Ryabkov was quoted by Gazeta.ru online news portal as saying. On Monday the White House announced fresh sanctions against Russia targeting seven government officials and 17 companies. Ryabkov said Moscow does not want to sever ties with the United States and the European Union. "We want to cut nothing as we've got lots of ties -- human and economical" he said. Last week Standard & Poor's rating agency downgraded Russia's long-term rating as well as ratings of a number of Russian companies amid the wave of sanctions imposed against Moscow by the West. Ryabkov called these actions "disgusting" and warned that Russia will retaliate.
