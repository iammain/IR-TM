The United States has just announced sanctions on individuals close to Putin to protest Russia's actions in Ukraine. (ALEXEY DRUZHINYN/KREMLIN POOL/RIA NOVOSTI/EPA) Given that the concept has been around since at least the Greek ages * it's a little worrying that there is still so much debate about whether economic sanctions actually work or not. Right now that problem appears especially acute: Sanctions seem to be the main if not only Western weapon for dealing with Russian aggression in Ukraine. Just Monday the United States announced sanctions on thoseindividuals close to President Vladimir Putin part of a broader campaign of targeted visa bans and asset freezes on the Russian elite over Russia's actions in Ukraine. However the success of the sanctions already in place is proving hard to ascertain: AsRussias deputy prime minister said of the last round of U.S. efforts: " Send me your teeth ground in impotent rage ." So when have economic sanctions actually worked? One of the best known investigations of that question is " Economic Sanctions Reconsidered " first published in 1985 byGary Clyde Hufbauer Jeffrey J. Schott Kimberly Ann Elliott. That book now on its third edition (from 2009) attempts to access the aims and success of every economic sanction for which it can find data. According to the latest edition the sanctions listed below are the only instances from 1914 to 2008 in which not only was the stated goal of the measures reached but the sanctions themselves were instrumental in achieving that goal thus receiving a full rating of 16 out of 16 . It isn't a long list and many of the entries are a little obscure. Where possible the cost to the nation targeted has been included: 1921: the League of Nations vs. Yugoslavia In 1921 the League of Nations threatened economic sanctions against Yugoslavia if it attempted to seize land from Albania. Yugoslavia backed down. 1925: the League of Nations vs. Greece Four years later the League of Nations threatened sanctions against Greece unless it withdrew from Bulgaria's border territory. Greece withdrew. 1948-1949: the United States vs. Netherlands As the Dutch East Indies struggled to become an independent Indonesia after World War II the United States suspended the Marshall Plan aid to authorities in the region after the Dutch arrested Indonesian leaders. After threats of sanctions the Dutch agreed to Indonesian independence in 1949. The sanctions cost 1.1% of the Dutch gross national product. 1958-1959: the U.S.S.R. vs. Finland During the "Night Frost Crisis" of 1958 and 1959 Finnish-Soviet relations were fraught after the Communists were excluded from government and Karl-August Fagerholm viewed as unfavorable to the Soviets was appointed as prime minister. The U.S.S.R. used economic sanctions to force Fagerholm's resignation.The sanctions cost 1.1.% of the Finnish GNP. 1961-1965: the United States vs. Ceylon (Sri Lanka) Between 1961 and 1965 the United States applied sanctions against theDominion of Ceylon (what is now Sri Lanka) after the socialist government of Sirimavo Bandaranaikewas accused ofexpropriating the assets of U.S. and British oil companies. The government fellin 1965 largely because of the economic effects of these sanctions which cost 0.6% of the the country's GNP. 1965-1967: the United States vs. India In 1965 the United States canceled food and military aid to India in a bid to force it to change its agricultural policies and to voice displeasure over its war with Pakistan earlier that year. In 1966 Indira Gandhi's government proposed new agricultural policies and U.S. aid resumed the next year. The economic cost was 0.08% of the Indian GNP. 1975-1976: the United States vs. South Korea In 1975 the United States used the threat of sanctions to discourage South Korea frombuying a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant from France which the U.S. thought might be secretly used to help make nuclear bombs. South Korea never bought the plant. 1976-1977: the United States vs. Taiwan In 1976 the United States learned that Taiwan was secretlydeveloping nuclear weapons so the United States delayed its export of nuclear material to the country. Taiwan later announced that it was abandoning its plans. The estimated economic cost was 0.1% of Taiwan's GNP. 1982-1986: South Africa vs. Lesotho South Africa applied economic pressure on Lesotho to make it return South African refugees with links to the African National Congress. After a military coup in Lesotho South Africa lifted a blockade on the landlocked nation and 60 ANC members were deported back home. The cost was estimated to be 5.1% of Lesotho's GNP. 1987-1988: the United States vs. El Salvador In 1988 the United States used economic sanctions to block El Salvador from releasing those accused of killing U.S. citizens. 1992-1993: the United States vs. Malawi The United States (and other nations) significantly cut aid in 1992 in a bid to improve the democratic standards and human rights situation in Malawi. Malawi was largely reliant on aid (the sanctions were estimated to cost 6.6% of its GNP) and swiftly adopted more open policies. After a referendum multi-party democracy was introduced in 1993 and aid was soon resumed. 1993: the United States vs. Guatemala In 1993 afterPresident Jorge Serrano dissolved Congress and said he would rule by decree the United States and European nations threatened sanctions. Business owners scared of the economic effects helped force Serrano out of power and installed a new presidentRamiro de Leon Carpio. The economic cost was said to be 1.3% of Guatemala's GDP. 1994-1995: Greece vs. Albania Greece suspended European Union aid to Albania in 1994 after five members of an ethnic Greek group in the country were given prison terms. After this economic pressure (said to have cost Albania 2.9% of its GNP) Albania reduced the sentences and released two and Greece resumed aid . --- The authors of"Economic Sanctions Reconsidered" looked at more than 200 sets of sanctions so this is not the most reassuring batting average. And it appears that many of the best-known sanctions such as those against South Africa during apartheid were probably not home runs. Some experts such as the University of Chicago's Robert A. Pape have argued that the definition of "sanction" used in the study is too broad further weakening the success rate of such economic penalties. There are some factors in the report's favor however: There were other sanctions that appeared to work of course (any sanction rated above 9 means that at least some aspect of the sanctioner's goals were achieved) plus we should remember that the list ends in 2008. There's another confusing factor: Targeted sanctions such as those used against Putin's allies are a relatively new form of economic sanctions. They only emerged afterthe broader sanctions that we saw before the 1990s fell out of favor when the worrying humanitarian effects on Iraq were revealed. The jury is still out on whether sanctions actually work. "The early assessments of these targeted sanctions is that they are quite useful in signaling displeasure and as tangible signs of support for international norms" Kimberly Ann Elliott one of the authors of "Economic Sanctions Reconsidered" told me in an e-mail. "Their utility in changing objectionable behavior is more questionable." *TheMegarian Decree ofc. 432 B.C. imposed economic sanctions on Megarians throughout theAthenian Empire.

View all Malaysia This map shows possible search corridors for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight Ten major international airlines disasters in the past 50 years View all The most offensive owner in world sports is (sadly) not Donald Sterling Gigi Becali the owner of Steaua football club in Bucharest. (Vadim Ghirda/AP) The comments allegedly made by Donald Sterling the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers have generated an understandable furor in the United States with many incensed by the vulgar racism aired in a leaked recording of a supposed conversation between him and a girlfriend. Even President Obama thousands of miles away on a tour of Asia was compelled to weigh in on the controversy. But as grotesque and unpalatable as the whole situation is the immediate and near-universal condemnation heaped upon Sterling as the story grew viral is a sign that there is at root a fundamental intolerance for this sort of intolerance in the United States despite all the racial injustices that remain. Other parts of the world still have more work to do. Exhibit A: Romania home of George "Gigi" Becali possibly the most offensive owner in world sports. Since 2003 Becali has been in charge of Steaua Bucharest one of the more famous and historic club sides in Eastern Europe. He is one of Romania's richest men a former shepherd turned real estate mogul who made his fortune in the chaos that followed the fall of Communism. He served in the European Parliament in Brussels from 2009 to 2012 and then in the Romanian parliament until May when he was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a dodgy land-swaps deal. (He has a very checkered legal history including an arrest on kidnapping charges and reports of match-fixing.) He is now in jail but still runs Steaua Bucharest. But Becali is controversial for a whole other set of reasons: his penchant for homophobic misogynist racist rhetoric. It'll be difficult to itemize every single offensive slur attributed to Becali a larger-than-life man who has become something of a pantomime villain in the European press. A devout Orthodox Christian Becali keeps artwork in his home depicting himself as Jesus and various apostles and saints. That religiosity has led to some extreme comments. In 2012 Becali reacted angrily to Lady Gaga's presence in Romania whom he deemed a "disciple of Satan": "When she comes on the TV I switch the channels after two seconds and spit on the TV" he said. Worse are his thoughts on homosexuals. He banned songs by the British band Queen from being played at the stadium because of the sexuality of Queen's late lead singer.In 2010 Becali reportedly blocked the acquisition of a Bulgarian player because of rumors that he was gay. Two years later after Steaua fans were heard singing homophobic chants Becali offered this outrageous defense : There is no excuse for discrimination. Yet of course while I love the gays you must understand: gays cannot be in football teams. The players bathe naked! I love gays but I'd never employ one. Put one in a team and you'd never win again. That earned censure elsewhere but did little to diminish his popularity among a segment of Romania's population. Becali not unlike Italy's Silvio Berlusconi (though more extreme) is a charismatic populist who has deployed his extensive wealth to win the support of a certain conservative base. Some critics see in Becali's slogans and campaigning gestures to the World War II-era Iron Guard a Romanian fascist movement. Far-right nationalism is very much alive in parts of Eastern Europe and Becali's bigotry sadly echoes wider prejudice. He has made dark comments on what he deemed the infiltration of Jews in Romanian politics. He reportedly fired a Turkish coach once "for being too Muslim." He once said women have "no more value" after giving birth. He called an African TV presenter an "ape." He is attributed with making racist remarks about the Roma the long-marginalized minority group in Eastern Europe known derogatorily as gypsies and even ethnic Hungarians living in Romania. And while he has no shortage of critics and opponents the chances are that Becali will emerge unscathed from his imprisonment still the owner of Steaua Bucharest as well as one of the world's most repugnant big mouths.

View all Malaysia This map shows possible search corridors for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight Ten major international airlines disasters in the past 50 years View all Saudi Arabia and Russia blast Norways human rights record. Wait. What? At a session of the United Nations' Universal Periodic Review where a selection of member states have their performance on human rights assessed Norway's record came under the microscope. The conspicuous critics at this Geneva meeting? Russia and Saudi Arabia members of the United Nations' 47-nation Human Rights Council and well-known paragons of global norms and freedoms of course. Representatives from Saudi Arabia accused Norway of endangering the religious rights of Muslims in the country. According to the Independent : The gulf state called for all criticism of religion and of prophet Mohammed to be made illegal in Norway. It also expressed concern at increasing cases of domestic violence rape crimes and inequality in riches and noted a continuation of hate crimes against Muslims in the country.... Russia meanwhile called for Norway to clamp down on expressions of religious intolerance and and criticised the countrys child welfare system. They also recommended that Norway improve its correctional facilities for those applying for asylum status. The Russian rebuke is perhaps less glaring than the criticisms of the Saudis who don't seem to mind the irony of demanding censorship and a curtailing of freedom of expression at a session on human rights. Ahead of Norway's grilling the country's foreign minister Borge Brende expressed bemusement at what may follow to local media:"It is a paradox that countries which do not support fundamental human rights have influence on the council but that is the United Nations" he said. Saudi Arabia of course is notorious for its draconian laws that among other harsh measures ban women from driving curb the religious expression of non-Muslim minorities and make homosexuality a crime punishable by death . As a custodian of the birthplace of Islam the kingdom's government has long championed the cause of Muslims elsewhere so it's not surprising that it watches the gains of anti-immigrant Islamophobic political groups in Scandinavia with concern. But for a country where domestic abuse of women and exploitation of foreign laborers is rife -- and where gang-rape victims can be sentenced to 200 lashes -- to harp on another state's far less offensive record is astonishing. Norway has long projected itself as a committed moral force on the global stage: It's home to the annual Nobel Peace Prize and has been a key host and interlocutor for peace talks between warring factions including in Colombia the Middle East and the Philippines. No country is beyond criticism of course and it's good that the United Nations has such procedures of oversight. When the Saudis faced their own review in 2009 there were calls to strengthen the rights of migrant workers and women subject to the country's sharia laws. One wonders how much progress the kingdom has truly made since then on that front. Ishaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

(Sergei Grits/AP) As the Ukrainian army launched its first major assault on the rebel stronghold in Slovyansk at dawn a CBS news crew was detained blindfolded and questioned by pro-Russian militants at a checkpoint just outside the city in the eastern part of the country. As our correspondents reportedrebels have taken several hostages including journalists and the seven members of a European security monitoring organization. According to CBS News correspondent Clarissa Ward the men who were holding the team yelled anti-American comments and beat one of her male colleagues but they were all ultimately freed. You can listen to Ward's live phone interview on CBS This Morning in the video below. Speaking over the phone with her colleagues in New York Ward said that her crew was stopped just outside of Slovyansk and told that the commander needed to ask his senior officer whether they should be let go or taken prisoner. Read the full transcript of the interview below: CHARLIE ROSE: A CBS News team has just been freed in Eastern Ukraine. Clarissa Ward and her crew were detained this morning. NORAH ODONNELL: They were held for hours. Clarissa joins us now on the telephone. Clarissa tell us what has happened. CLARISSA WARD: Hi good morning. We were stopped at a checkpoint just outside the city of Slovyansk where we were trying to go because the Ukrainian military had allegedly started an operation to dismantle some of the pro-Russian separatists who were in the town. We were stopped and told that the commander needed to ask his commander whether we should either be let go or taken prisoner. From there we were then taken to another nearby tent where we were blindfolded with sort of cloth and masking tape really quite tightly bound around our heads so we couldnt see anything at all. We were then bundled into a vehicle and taken to another location. When we got out of the car there they were quite rough and quite sharp with us. There was a woman shouting at us not to speak at all. We had to have our hands in the air and put them against the wall. People went through all of our belongings - you know everything and put it into bags which they did give back to us later. But they took our earrings they took our passports. Then the women were separated. Myself and producer were taken to a separate area and they appeared to have a video camera from what I could hear although obviously I couldnt see anything and they were asking do you have family? and why are you here? and where are you from? Of course when youre asked in that situation whether you have family and they were like do you have children? and who is your family? you start to feel a little pit in your stomach because its not clear which direction things are going in. Our male colleagues were in a different area. One of them was beaten. But then men who were holding us kept telling us not to be frightened and that everything would be ok. Then another group of commanders appeared to come in and gave them instructions to release us ultimately. But all in all I think its fair to say that it was an unpleasant and quite frightening experience. ROSE: Absolutely. Did they ever say to you why they were releasing you and why they were holding you? WARD: They claimed that well the sort of more sober-minded commanders that let us go at the end said that the people who had taken us were emotional because of what was happening with the Ukrainian Army in Slovyansk today. Certainly its fair to say that when I was listening to the pro-Russian separatists speaking to each other I can understand Russian and there was a lot of very strong anti-American rhetoric going on. One guy was shouting at me in Russian you know If president Obama was smart he wouldnt be supporting the fascists in Kiev. So I think certainly that may have something to do with it.

But later in 2012 as he campaigned to reclaim the presidency he unveiled Website Vladimir Putin. The page showed among other things pictures of Putin fishing rafting in a power boat taming what appears to be a tiger playing hockey driving small cars and stretching in his judo outfit . Some Russians according to Radio Free Europe werent as enthralled with Putins many interests as he. Please leave politics begged one man identified as Andrei Antonenko in a comment posted on Website Vladimir Putin. We understand that power is like a drug but this would be a dignified act.Another commenter Mikhail Meshkov pleaded : A lot of my friends are thinking about leaving Russia. Do you need this? Do we? I dont. I want to live in a normal country. So get out before its too late. The observations were immediately removed Radio Free Europe reports and replaced with statements praising Putin and calling on him to impose censorship. One of the many ways the internet has punished Putin: When Russian soldiers singing Get Lucky at the Sochi Olympics went viral. One opposition leader named Alexei Navalny said :Vladimir Putin and his team do not understand the Internet. But according to Putins musings on Thursday that conclusion couldnt be more wrong. Putin has the Internet figured out. Speaking at a media event in St. Petersburg Putin called the Internet a CIA project which is still developing as such. To combat it Putin said Russia must fight for its interests online. Little however fuels a Web mob like attacks from state leaders. Just ask Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan who is still waging his own personal campaign against Twitter after several high-profile backfires . Twitter now toes the line! one of his officials declared last weekend after Twitter blocked two accounts that had leaked recordings showing alleged corruption. Or consider China which has stoked outrage over its recent war on Internet porn .Indeed like other state leaders before Putin took a drubbing online over his nascent CIA-internet hypothesis. Vlado Putin called the Internet a CIA project Russia is going back to stone age with this idiot at the wheel  Jozef (@jzalik) April 24 2014 The comment however represents just the latest move Putin has taken against the Web since he was reelected Russias president. Although rarely as publicly as he did Thursday Putin has methodically out-muscled some of the Internets strongest Russian voices with censorship legislation and intimidation.The year Putin took back the Kremlin this Freedom House study referred to the Internet in Russia as the last relatively uncensored platform for public debate. This assessment however was something Putin evidently could not abide. In the months following the government sued and fined three Internet service providers according to the Ria Novosti news agency. Then the government blacklisted Russias Facebook VKontakte. Putin backed off the banning saying it had been an accident. This was a mistake he explained . Our employee put a tick in the wrong place. By October 2013 Russias Internet ranking by Freedom House had dropped 10 spots placing it between Venezuela and Zimbabwe. But Putin was only getting started. The Russia State Duma adopted on Tuesday new legislation aimed at Internet users called bloggers. Any blog that clocks more than 3000 daily visitors must now register with the state body for media oversight. Those blogs now need to verify information for accuracy and will be held accountable for any third-party comment posted on their sites or social media. Pavel Durov the founder of Russias equivalent of Facebook announced he had been fired from his job as CEO and that the social network is now under full control of oligarchs belonging to Putins inner circle . Durov then fled the country. Thursday Putin was still complaining about the Internet. Beyond voicing concerns over alleged CIA involvement he also took aim atYandex a search engine thats bigger in Russia than Google. He complained that the company was registered in the Netherlandsnot only for tax reasons but for other considerations too.

Russians celebrate the coming of spring and since communist times Labor Day on May 1. (Maxim Shemetov/Reuters) MOSCOW The 1st of May in Russia is always a nationwide excuse for a party but in this newly expansionist Russian epoch Thursdays rallies were far larger than usual. Tens of thousands of jubilant Russians took to the streets of Moscow to march past the Kremlin through Red Square and up a central boulevard the first time that trade unions held May Day marches through Red Square since 1991 shortly before the breakup of the Soviet Union. Children tugging on balloons elderly medal-bedecked veterans and a wide range of Russians in between sang old labor songs on a sunny Moscow day. Some sported signs saying Lets go vacation in Crimea the peninsula that was an autonomous region of Ukraine until it was annexed by Russia in March setting off one of the most dangerous confrontations between Russia and the West since the end of the Cold War. Others carried banners condemning President Obama and NATO which many Russians regard as a security threat that has crept up to their borders. In this flower-mad nation many women carried red carnations. Russian Communist Party activists parade in central Moscow on May 1 2014 during their traditional May Day rally. (Kirill  Images) Today is a wonderful day! the head of the Moscow Trade Union Federation Sergey Chernov told the crowd from a stand in front of GUM the famous department store that abuts Red Square. Crimea and Sevastopol have returned to Russia! Unions have returned to Red Square! In keeping with the retro mood President Vladimir Putin awarded five people the Hero of Labor medal a Soviet-era honor that he revived last year. An oil company worker a museum director a farm manager a high school teacher and the coach of the Russian National Synchronized Swimming team were all given medals Thursday. We have a very good tradition Putin said in a ceremony at the Kremlin. On the 1st of May the day of spring and Labor Day we honor the citizens of Russia that through their achievements have improved the power prestige and wealth of our country. But after the main rally had disbanded a discordant tune sliced through the air. Seven protesters singing the Ukrainian national anthem and carrying a Ukrainian flag marched down empty upscale Tverskaya Boulevard. More than a dozen police officers charged at them throwing two men and one woman into a nearby police van and ripping up the Ukrainian flag. The woman shouted from the van that the police were being violent but then the door slammed and her voice could no longer be heard. We're here because we have no alternatives.

(William Booth/The Washington Post) Strange things have been happening in eastern Ukraine a place swirling with rumors of imminent invasion by the "Little Green Men" (what the suspected Russian troops without insignia are being called). A couple of British journalists and I were driving back to our hotel after a day of chasing news on the outskirts of Slovyansk when Boris our intrepid taxi driver pointed out the window and shouted Look at that! We or at least I ducked -- but then we looked. It was a large gray military-style helicopter. And something was falling out of the sky. It was dropping leaflets which fluttered toward the highway to Kramatorsk then drifted in the spring breeze into a cow field and apple orchard. Mission accomplished. A couple of locals pulled over and so did we to grab a handful out of the trees. Dear Peaceful Citizens of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk! The leaflets read.Here are your instructions on how to SURVIVE in the territories where Russian terrorists act. There was a black and white image of a masked man with a Kalashnikov and then what appears to be the Ukrainian Security Service version of a listicle. The first point: 1. Dont go close to the occupied buildings. You can become a human shield or hostage. It is a good picture for Russian media. Russian media are generally seen by the government in Kiev as instruments of the Russian state especially President Vladimir Putin. 2. Dont listen to those who spout propaganda for federalization. They're being paid 1000 UAH per day. That would be about $80 a day which is real money in eastern Ukraine where in July 2013 the average monthly salary was 3901 UAH or about $312 at todays rates. The instructions continue: They ask peace-loving citizens to inform law enforcement about suspicious people and groups of people carrying bags.They ask please don't join any self-defense groups: They're anti-Ukrainian. Also: Avoid participating in mass rallies. The leaflet warns that there are Russian GRU assets circulating in the crowds (GRU is Russia's military intelligence directorate) and that they might liquidate those who criticize Russian politics. On that note the instructions also warn the peaceful citizens to keep themselves and loved ones away from terrorists and anti-Ukrainian actions. Why? Because "all those who participate in anti-Ukrainian actions are potential victims. You can see the full leaflet below: The leaflet itself.

View Photo Gallery Restrictions on international aid have exacerbated a growing health crisis among stateless Muslim Rohingya in western Burma. The Rohingya may be the most well-known forgotten people on earth. The minority Muslim community living along Burma's western border has been discriminated against for decades by the central Burmese state. Their plight is well-documented but that has changed few of the grim facts on the ground. These pictures provided by Reuters come from a number of camps for the internally displaced in Burma's western Arakan state also known as Rakhine that are home now to tens of thousands of Rohingya who fled recent rounds of ethnic mob violence. A displaced Rohingya woman Norbagoun holds her severely malnourished twins in their shelter at the Dar Paing camp for internally displaced people in Sittwe Rakhine state on April 24. (Reuters/Minzayar ) The images show the deplorable living conditions there made far worse after the forced removal of foreign NGO aid workers some of whom were expelled by Burmese authorities in February. Hunger and malnutrition stalk the camps leaving infant children most vulnerable. According to one aid worker whom Reuters cites in the Kyein Ni Pin camp six infants have died there in the weeks since doctors from Medecins Sans Frontieres were ordered out of the country. Norbagoun's babies are less than a month old. (Reuters/Minzayar) The Rohingya are looked upon by many other Burmese as Bengali interlopers illegally living in a foreign land; most Rohingya are denied Burmese citizenship. But the vast majority of the roughly 1.3 million people considered Rohingya who live in Burmahave called Arakan state home for generations. Toms Ojea Quintana aU.N. special rapporteur surveyed the situation earlier this month in the wake of the withdrawal of aid workers. He documented food shortages and the lack of access to water and to adequate medical care. The conditions he said were part of a "long history of discrimination and persecution against the Rohingya Muslim community which could amount to crimes against humanity." Rohingya children walk past shelters inside the Kyein Ni Pyin camp for internally displaced people in Pauk Taw Rakhine state on April 23. (Reuters/Minzayar) Sectarian and ethnic strife have shadowed Burma's slow transition to democracy after years of brutal military dictatorship. A strident Buddhist nationalism fueled by some particularly radical characters is in part to blame. In March of 2013 Buddhist mobs reportedly targeted Muslim neighborhoods Muslims who were not ethnic Rohingya in the central Burmese town of Meikhtila after a local dispute at a gold shop. At least 43 people were killed in what some described as a fiery pogrom the worst single incident in a wave of violence that has led to more than 300 deaths and prompted at least 140000 to flee their homes in recent years. Some have been dismayed by the relative silence of Aung San Suu Kyi Burma's Nobel laureate a champion of democracy and now the lead opposition figure in parliament. Meanwhile the Rohingya suffer in the margins not totally forgotten but largely devoid of help and hope. Ishaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

(Larry Downing/REUTERS) On Monday thousands of protesters greeted President Obama as he held talks with his counterpart Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III at the presidential palace in Manila. The demonstrators even burned an effigy of the American commander-in-chief. But that did nothing to thwart the inking of a landmark security deal between the two countries. The new 10-year defense agreement is perhaps the most significant achievement of Obama's four-country tour of Asia where the Philippines was the final destination. U.S. troops now have expanded access to Philippine facilities and will participate in an increased number of joint military exercises with the archipelago nation. There's no plan at present for a permanent American troop presence nor a clear indication that the U.S. would come to the Philippines' defense in the face of an external threat. But the pact represents something an about-face for Manila: more than two decades ago the last U.S. naval base in the country at Subic Bay -- a legacy of nearly half a century of American colonial rule --was shut down. (At the time Aquino's mother Corazon was the country's President.) The protesters demonstrating against Obama were angered by what they saw as the meddling return of a former imperial power. But a much larger group of Filipinos is more concerned with newer Asian realities. The Philippines has increasingly sparred with China over disputed islands in the South China Sea a body of water that China claims almost in its entirety despite the rival claims of a number of Southeast nations. As detailed here China's emergence as a budding superpower has occurred parallel to a massive expansion of its naval capabilities which has other countries in the region nervous. In the last two years Chinese and Philippine vessels have engaged in tense standoffs over a set of shoals (see map below) just miles away from the Philippine coast. This March Chinese coast guard ships blocked Philippine civilian vessels from resupplying marines stationed at the Second Thomas shoal among the countless spits of rock and reef that comprise the contested archipelagos of the South China Sea. In 2012 after the Philippine navy intercepted Chinese fishing vessels poaching protected species by the Scarborough shoal Chinese maritime ships arrived to prevent the fishermen's arrest--an incident that almost escalated into conflict. The spats have inflamed Philippine public opinion. According to Pew only 48 percent of Filipinos now have a favorable view of China--compared to 85 percent for the U.S. For all the ire American foreign policy attracts elsewhere in the world there are still countries--including many in East Asia--where the involvement of the U.S. is recognized as a guarantor of stability. The Philippines in particular is a nation well-disposed to the U.S. with so much of its politics and society shaped by the decades of American occupation following the Spanish-American War . Manila's alliance with Washington has strengthened under Aquino . When I met him before his election victory in 2010 he spoke generously of China's role in the region and the Philippines' desire to have strong ties with all major players in the Pacific. But in the intervening years Aquino's stance perceptibly hardened and he has become perhaps the most forthright statesman in Southeast Asia when it comes to confronting perceived Chinese aggression. Obama meanwhile reiterated that the new defense deal with the Philippines was not about containing China. But it's hard not to view it in the context of a larger geopolitical chess match in the Pacific. The U.S. now has greater operational flexibility when contemplating maneuvers and actions in the South China Sea. The protesters in Manila may remain apoplectic about Uncle Sam's footprint but strategists in Beijing will have cause for pause as well.

(Laris Karklis/The Washington Post) During an epic question-and-answer session with the Russian public Thursday President Vladimir Putin dropped a reference that is likely to be obscure to many in the West.Talking about the Ukrainian elections and ethnic Russians in that country's east Putin took a detour through history. "I would like to remind you that what was called Novorossiya back in the tsarist days Kharkov Lugansk Donetsk Kherson Nikolayev and Odessa were not part of Ukraine back then" Putin said. "The center of that territory was Novorossiysk so the region is called Novorossiya. Russia lost these territories for various reasons but the people remained." Putin's comment might be taken as it was portrayed as an aside or a little tidbit of information if it weren't for the fact that Novorossiya has been brought up so often in recent days by pro-Russian activists who have reportedly been chanting the word as they argued against staying with Kiev . Someone has even set up a Web site that appears devoted to bringing the historical region back . If nothing else Putin's comments are relatively accurate historically: Novorossiya was won from the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century. Its name which means "New Russia" is a reflection of that. It became a part of theUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in the early years of the Soviet Union and remained a part of Ukraine after the collapse of communism. Talking about Novorossiya fits in with Putin's broader habit of talking about a golden era of Russian empire and using history to justify modern action. It's a similar action Putin made with Crimea though in this case the historical justification is a little harder to make: Crimea only became part of Ukraine in 1954 and you have to wonder what's to stop Turkey from deciding that its own claims onNovorossiya earlier still than Russia's are more valid? In the modern world things are more complicated. As the map below to the left shows Crimea's large ethnic Russian population is not matched in any of the regions that once made up Novorossiya. However as you can see from the map on the right it makes up a big portion of the GDP of Ukraine. (Laris Karklis/The Washington Post) It's not clear right now whether Putin has any real plan to annex Novorossiya or whether it is just talk. But if Putin is hoping to foment chaos in Ukraine it would appear that Crimea has shown him that history can be potent weapon. Adam Taylor writes about foreign affairs for the Washington Post.

(Charles Dharapak/AP) President Obama's ongoing tour through four Asian countries is a sign we're told of Washington's renewed effort to " pivot " or " rebalance " toward Asia. Far from conflict hot spots in the Middle East and now Eastern Europe the Asia-Pacific is home to some of the world's most dynamic exciting economies. As Obama's former national security adviser Tom Donilon wrote this week in The Washington Post the administration is keen to move beyond the wars and occupations that "dominated U.S. national security policy and resources for the past decade" in favor of "a shift toward the region that presents the most significant opportunity for the United States." But Asia is hardly a space free of contest. Obama's swing through Japan South Korea Malaysia and the Philippines four democracies with warm ties to the U.S. is a visit to allies who are to varying degrees wary of the rise of budding superpower China. Though U.S. officials repeatedly disavow claims that the U.S. seeks to "contain" China Beijing appears to believe it and so do many scholarly observers . Here are three ways the specter of China looms large during Obama's Asia trip. Balance of power in the Pacific : For decades a Pax Americana underpinned by U.S. naval supremacy has authored the status quo in Asia. American military dominance is still a fact but China's aggressive military expansion over the past two decades its defense budget grew more than 12 percent this year alone calls into question the long-term balance of power. Last year China commissioned 17 new warships more than any other nation. It aims to have four aircraft carriers by 2020 and has developed a considerable fleet of nuclear submarines. In the next few decades China's ability to project naval power will extend deep into the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. (The Obama administration in a thinly-veiled response has committed to an expanded military presence in Australia and will work on a new security deal with the Philippines when in Manila next week.) China's build-up comes alongside an increasing number of diplomatic spats between China and its neighbors over disputed territories particularly islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Tensions with the nationalist government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the Senkaku islands known by the Chinese as the Diaoyu Islands have flared dangerously in the past year with Japanese and Chinese aircraft and vessels engaging in dangerously provocative maneuvers. Calming Asia's troubled waters is no easy task especially for an administration that wants to buttress traditional allies but remains fearful of antagonizing Beijing. Obama's mixed messaging in Tokyo was evidence of the awkward diplomatic tight rope he has to walk. Chinas global footprint : China is changing the game away from Asia as well. This year China eclipsed the U.S. for the first time as the worlds largest trading nation. The map below compiled by the Chinese Relations blog shows the extent to which China has become the biggest trading partner of many countries in the developing world particularly in Africa. (Note: It discounts the European Union as a single trading bloc for illustrative effect.) China is the number one trading partner of all countries in red  Beyond trade China is pouring billions of dollars into megaprojects around the world. Its state companies are building and investing in roads mines stadiums and dams from Papua New Guinea to Peru . The growing scope of China Inc. driven largely by China's insatiable appetite for natural resources raises thorny questions about the future of global politics. Is Chinese influence in developing countries harmful for democracy ? How does Washington deal with its declining clout in Latin America? Should we be concerned about a new form of Chinese neo-imperialism ? The Obama administration's desire to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal a massive free trade pact that would knit together a host of countries around the Pacific is in part aimed at reasserting American influence in a part of the world where it was once the unquestioned hegemon. Friendship with Russia : It's no secret U.S.-Russia relations are in a bad place with the West struggling to deal with Moscow's power play in Ukraine. Sanctions on Russian officials have been imposed and new rounds threatened as the Ukraine crisis worsens. But China Russia's frequent collaboratoron the U.N. Security Council presents Russia with something of an escape. Recent reports suggest that the two countries may be close on a long-mooted natural gas deal worth billions of dollars. It's a deal that makes sense especially if Russia wants to thumb its nose at Europe currently the chief importer of Russian natural gas. Russia and China are finding more reasons to deepen their political and economic ties expanding trade and military links. For American strategists they present a troubling axis of illiberal authoritarian states that has already stymied U.S. objectives over a host of issues at the U.N. including the drive for tough action on Syria. At the same time the U.S.'s democratic allies in Asia are finding more reasons to bicker Abe's nationalist government in Japan has riled South Korea while India and the grouping of Southeast Asian nations ASEAN show little to no inclination to help the U.S. hedge against China. The American "pivot" to Asia may be an escape from quagmires further west but it comes with no shortage of headaches of its own. Ishaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

(YouTube) On Friday Ukraine's army launched its first major assault on a rebel stronghold with the state's military attempting to retakeSlovyansk a region currently controlled by pro-Russian militia. The assault has seen casualties on both sides and Ukraine'sDefense Ministry said that twoMi-24 attack helicopters were shot down and two crew members killed. A number of amateur videos posted online appear to show the helicopters being attacked. One video later shared by the pro-Kiev Euromaidan PR account and picked up by the United Kingdom's Channel 4 appears to show a helicopter going down after being shot: Other footage which appears to have been shot and uploaded to YouTube by a pro-Russian activist seems to show a helicopter being shot at over a militia checkpoint outside Sloyvansk. And one more amateur video appears to show a crowd cheering in Russian as they see a large explosion in the distance which the person who uploaded the video says is a Ukrainian helicopter crashing. While it is difficult to conclusively confirm the authenticity of these videos a representative of Euromaidan PR said they believed all three were authentic. They are just a handful of the many more that have been uploaded to YouTube over the past 12 hours . The downing of multiple helicopters is being taken as proof that the pro-Russian militias are at least being armed by Russia. The Ukrainian Security Service is saying that at least one helicopter was shot down by asurface-to-air missile which ledSweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt to tweet: Ukrainian helicopters shoot down in Slovyansk.

Now if this sounds familiar she said its what Hitler did back in the 30s.... Germans by ancestry were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places [and] Hitler kept saying theyre not being treated right. I must go and protect my people. Then the German finance minister said the Crimea absorption was analogous to Hitlers 1938 seizure ofSudetenland. Weve seen this before in  saidbefore quickly backing off the comment.Hitler took over the Sudetenland with these types of tactics. Afterward as reported by Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen a prominent Russian thinker mulled the same. One must distinguish between Hitler before 1939 and Hitler after 1939 Andranik Migranyan said. The thing is that Hitler collected [German] lands. If he had become famous only for uniting without a drop of blood Germany with Austria Sudetenland and Memel in fact completing what Bismarck failed to do and if he had stopped there then he would have remained a politician of the highest class.

Korean forces President Obama speaks as South Korean President Park Geun-hye looks on in a joint news conference at the Blue House on April 25 in Seoul South Korea. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) During the first two legs of his Asia tour at stops in Japan and South Korea President Obama paid tribute to those who died in the tragic Sewol ferry disaster sought to offer support to Asian allies in the face of external threats (read: North Korea and to a lesser extent China) and found time to kick a soccer ball around with a robot . But somewhat lost in the headlines was another interesting wrinkle: Following meetings in Seoul it emerged that Washington was possibly going to postpone its planned handover of wartime command of South Korea's forces which had been slated for 2015. Wait you say. The U.S. commands the South Korean military? Yes and no. Since 1994 South Korea has retained peacetime control over its armed forces. But in the event of conflict breaking out most probably with neighboring pariah state and regional irritant North Korea the U.S. would assume "operational control" known as OPCON in military jargon over the South's armed forces. It's a relic of the uneasy armistice that ended the Korean War six decades ago and has led to a permanent U.S. troop presence on the peninsula ever since (some 28500 soldiers). If the North attacks the U.S. must take the lead to battle its Cold War foe. The new delay in the proposed handover is largely a result of South Korean skittishness as my colleague Craig Whitlock reported last September in the face of the North's increasingly erratic bellicose behavior under its young leader Kim Jong Un. While the South Korean army is more than a match for that of the North the U.S. military is better equipped to deal with an enemy that possesses the nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities North Korea is believed to have in its arsenal. Here's Whitlock: South Korean officials began a public campaign this summer for a delay beyond 2015 but haven't specified a new date. U.S. officials have not agreed to any changes. Some have said they are becoming frustrated with South Koreas reluctance to take charge of its own defense ... In February [2013] North Korea conducted a nuclear test two months after testing a long-range ballistic missile that could strike the western United States. Memories are also fresh here of a March 2010 incident in which North Korea torpedoed a South Korean naval vessel killing 46 sailors. Responding to South Korean angst felt most keenly by the conservatives currently in power in Seoul Obama offered assurances that the U.S. would perhaps not be transferring its wartime command so soon. "Given the evolving security environment in the region including the enduring North Korean nuclear missile threat we can reconsider the 2015 timeline" said Obama at a news conference alongside South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Of course not all South Koreans want the U.S. to retain these wartime powers. In most other circumstances no sovereign nation would cede such authority to another state. Robert E. Kelly assistant professor of international relations at Pusan National University in South Korea offers a good explanation of the politics of OPCON here . The first handover planned for 2012 had been demanded by a progressive government in Seoul in 2006. Subsequent conservative administrations now keep pushing back the date. Kelly outlines the contours of the domestic debate in South Korea: [U.S. wartime command] smacks of neocolonialism and external control. The Korean left in particular has long been uncomfortable with the U.S. presence. Like many Western European leftist parties during the Cold War the South Korean left is deeply divided over how to approach the communists. A minority could be fairly described as pro-Pyongyang... More generally there is some confused sympathy for the Norths goals and a strong willingness to blame the Americans for making North Korea so paranoid and awful. Where conservatives tend to see a megalomaniacal out-of-control monarchy progressives tend to see North Korea pushed into harshness by U.S. imperialism. Hence a reversion of OPCON could reduce tensions by reducing the Northern perception that the U.S. is out to get it . One can imagine that many in the U.S.would welcome not having to shoulder such a burden on the other side of the planet. But even as American troops prepare to pull out of Afghanistan later this year the frozen intractable Korean conflict grinds on. Ishaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

View all Malaysia This map shows possible search corridors for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight Ten major international airlines disasters in the past 50 years View all An updated glossary with everything you need to know about Ukraines crisis A pro-Ukrainian supporter foreground stands opposite pro-Russia supporters in Donetsk. (AP) About six weeks ago we published a glossary of key terms in the Ukraine crisis; since then Crimea voted to become part of Russia and conflict has shifted to the eastern part of the country. Here are the keywords phrases people and places involved. We've added Donbass Donetsk People's Republic "green men" Novorossiya Transnistria and Dmytro Yarosh as well as edited throughout. (What else should we add? E-mail! ) Anti-protest laws: Measures Viktor Yanukovych passed Jan. 16 designed to limit protests . Dubbed the " Dictatorship Laws " by protesters they led to a new level of violence in the Euromaidan protests and were repealed by parliament two weeks later. Berkut: Descended from an elite force in Soviet times the Berkut were Ukrainian riot police who operated under the Interior Ministry. At the center of much of the violence with Euromaidan protesters they were disbanded Feb. 26 . There were reports in March that Russia is givin out passports to ex-Berkut officers . Black Sea Fleet: A Russian naval unit that has been based in the Crimeancity of Sevastopol . Its not a particularly powerful force. It consists of an aging guided-missile cruiser the Moskva; a large dated  cruiser; a destroyer; two frigates; landing ships; and a diesel-powered attack submarine. Viktor Yanukovych and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev reached a deal to extend the lease on facilities in Crimea until 2042 in exchange for a discounted deal for natural gas. The Budapest Memorandum: An agreement in 1994 that saw Russia the United States and Great Britain agree to recognize the "independence and sovereignty" of Ukraine in exchange for it giving up its stockpile of nuclear weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that this agreement is void as Ukraine is no longer the same state it was in 1994 . Crimea: A peninsula jutting into the northern tip of the Black Sea. This strategically located region has been fought over many times over the course of its complicated history . Long a part of Russia it was given to Ukraine in 1954 though it enjoyed a good dose of autonomy. Residents of Crimea the majority of whom are ethnically Russian voted March 16 to leave Ukraine and join Russia. Crimean War: A three-year war that started in 1853 and ended up with Russia keeping Crimea even though it lost the war. Russia fought an alliance of the Ottoman Empire France Britain and Sardinia over disputes involving the Middle East and religion. It's widely considered the beginning of modern warfare. Crimean Tatars: A Sunni Muslim Turkic ethnic group that has been in Crimea since before it became part of Russia . Notably the entire population was deported to Central Asia as punishment for collaboration with German forces during World War II. Since 1991 they have been coming back in droves: By Ukraine's last census in 2001 they were said to make up 12 percent of the population . As you might imagine they are said to be anti-Russian and largely supportive of the Euromaidan protests. NB: It's Tatar not Tartar . The demographic split: To put this very simply thanks to a complicated history Ukraine can broadly be split between a Ukrainian-speaking Westand a Russian-speaking East. Some have argued that this is an oversimplification (most things are) but it does still seem to hold weight. Donbass: A region of eastern Ukraine with an unofficial capital of Donetsk.Pro-Russian separatists are operating in parts of this region. Donetsk People's Republic: A self-declared breakaway region of Ukraine in the eastern region of Donetsk the the pro-Russian Donetsk People's Republic seeks a break from Kiev. The region is not recognized by outside states and there have been some questions about its legitimacy . In mid-April a number of masked men carrying a Russian flag reportedly handed out leaflets demanding that Jews register. The leaflet bore the logo of the Donetsk People's Republic though temporary leaderDenis Pushilin denied any involvement. Euromaidan: The name given to the anti-government protests that began Nov. 21 2013 and eventually led to the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych . The name comes from the hopes of further European integration many had and the name of their central Kiev location Maidan Nezalezhnosti . "The family": The name given to Viktor Yanukovych 's immediate family and other associates who are said to have enriched themselves through corruption and nepotism. "Fascists": Both Russia 's foreign ministry and Viktor Yanukovych have linked "fascist" elements to the Euromaidan protests. There is some truth to this far-right Ukrainian nationalist groups such as Svoboda or Pravy Sektor have been a part of the protests . Maidan supporters however dispute the idea that the protests are at all dominated by these groups and critics have accused the Kremlin of playing "political football" with (the very real threat) of anti-Semitism in Ukraine. Gazprom: Russia 's huge state-controlled gas company. Russia says Ukraine owes it $2.2 billion for fuel and that Ukraine will have to start paying for gas in advance unless it pays down that debt. The last time Russia and Ukraine argued over prices Gazprom turned off the gas . Also worth noting: 15 percent of Europes gas imports come through Ukraine the Financial Times reports . "Green men": The euphemism used to describe the irregular or paramilitary forces deployed first in Crimea and now in Eastern Ukraine in the service of pro-Russia separatists. These troops wore uniforms with no emblem or insignia allowing Moscow to initially dismiss claims that it was behind the separatist takeover of parts of Ukraine. But Western governments are firmly convinced that these green men are directly linked to the Russian military. Kiev: Ukraines capital (also written as Kyiv) and the center of protests against the Yanukovych government. Its population tends to lean more to the west and Europe than east to Russia. It was also the focal point of protests in the Orange Revolution in 2004. Klitschko Vitali: A former professional boxer and heavyweight champion Klitschko was perhaps one of the most prominent political leaders at the Euromaidan protests and certainly one of the best-known internationally. In a leaked phone call however U.S. officials spoke disapprovingly of his chances for leadership . He is currently leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform. Lustration: As Will Englund wrote for The Post Maidan protesters used the phrase "lustration" to describe what they want from the new government . The term was first used after the fall of the Soviet Union to describe the purge of Communist officials from the government and bureaucracy in post-Soviet states. In Ukraine however it's being used to describe the purging of the government of those associated with Viktor Yanukovych . Lviv: A culturally important city in Ukraine 's west. Lviv apparently played a big role in the Euromaidan protests: It was reported to be sending 1000 protesters a day to Maidan Nezalezhnosti at the height of the protests. Magnitsky Act: A U.S. human rights law that created a blacklist of Russian officials last year. Bill Browder a fund manager at the center of campaigning for the act has told The Washington Post that it should be expanded in light of the Crimea crisis. Maidan Nezalezhnosti: A square at the center of Kiev its name quite literally means "Independence Square." It was at the heart of protests against Soviet rule in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the Orange Revolution . NATO's Article 4: Poland has requested meetings under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Here's the full text of that article : "The Parties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened." NATO meetings for Article 4 are exceptionally rare: Only Turkey has used them before twice during the Iraq war and once during the Syrian conflict. Novorossiya: A term referenced by Russian President Vladimir Putin that means "New Russia." It's territory won from the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century that included much of what is now eastern Ukraine. The term has also been brought up by pro-Russia activists in Ukraine as they've argued against staying with Kiev. Orange Revolution: A series of protests that began in November 2004 following the disputed election of Viktor Yanukovych as president. That vote was thrown out by the country's Supreme Court and a re-vote was held that put Viktor Yushchenko in office. Protests ended in January 2005 with Yushchenko's inauguration. Much like the Euromaidan protests the center of the action was Maidan Nezalezhnosti and protesters considered themselves more European than their Russia-leaning countrymen in the east. Putin Vladimir: A former KGB agent in East Germany St. Petersburg native Putin had an unexpected rise through Russia 's political elite during the 1990s before becoming prime minister in 1999 and president in 2000. Apart from a brief period between 2008 and 2012 when he was prime minister again (during which many suspected he was still the real power) Putin has been leading the country ever since. He believes that the new Euromaidan-linked Ukraine government is illegitimate and led by "fascists." Russia: Ukraines neighbor to the east. Its big and powerful and taking a strong interest in Ukraine. Youve probably heard of it. Russo-Georgian war: A short war in 2008 between Russia and former Soviet republic Georgia over the separatist states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It took just five days for Russia to overwhelm Georgia's far smaller army. Some believe that the war was a blatant act of aggression by Russia and that it set a worrying precedent for the situation happening now in Crimea . Sanctions: The United States and the European Union have both targeted a number of Russian individuals with sanctions due to their involvement in the Ukrainian crisis. While the sanctions took aim at a number of Putin's inner circle and won plaudits from some some on the list have mocked it as ineffective . The U.S. is said to be considering more sanctions . Sevastopol: The deep-water port in Crimea is home to Russia s Black Sea Fleet and was the headquarters of Ukraines navy. Sevastopol was under siege for 11 months during the Crimean War and was heavily bombed by the Germans during World War II. Its also a popular seaside resort and looks feels and sounds like a little corner of Russia. Transnistria: A sliver of Moldova that split away from the country as the Soviet Union collapsed and has effectively been a Russian and Ukrainian-speaking enclave ever since . In late March a senior NATOleader warned that Russia might try and move its troops across Ukraine to reach this area.It's home to a Russian army base and has a population of about a half a million. Turchynov Oleksandr : Current acting president of Ukraine and speaker of the Verkhovna Rada . According to the BBC he has said he would seek to reopen negotiations with the European Union but has also said he is "open to dialogue with Russia ." Considered an ally of Yulia Tymoshenko . Tymoshenko Yulia: : Tymoshenko rose to power as one of the predominant leaders of 2004's Orange Revolution and became prime minister of Ukraine in 2005. Her eventual fallout with Viktor Yushchenko lead to her star falling however and she lost the 2010 presidential election to Viktor Yanukovych . In her time in office however she helped negotiate a new gas deal with Russia that bypassed companies linked with Yanukovych but saw Ukraine pay a higher price. After Yanukovych came to power she was charged with misuse of power and sent to jail only to be released in February after Euromaidan . Ukraine: A country about the size of Texas with a population of about 46 million bordered by Moldova Romania Hungary Slovakia Poland Belarus and this one is important Russia. It got its independence when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Please note it's not " the Ukraine " just "Ukraine." Verkhovna Rada: Often just called the Rada this is Ukraine 's parliament. It's played an important role in Ukraine's crisis pulling back Viktor Yanukovych's more drastic anti-protest laws releasing Yulia Tymoshenko and ultimately ousting Yanukovych . Yanukovych Viktor: Yanukovych was president of Ukraine from 2010 till February 2014 though he claims he is still president. Raised in eastern Ukraine he is said to have had a rocky start in life and ended up in jail twice (though the BBC notes that his official biography claims that the convictions were eventually overturned). He worked his way up through the post-Soviet political world to eventually run in the 2004 presidential elections but never actually took office after the Orange Revolution questioned the legitimacy of the vote and he lost the re-vote. Yanukovych's critics say he has enriched himself at his country's expense and see his lavish mansion near Kiev as evidence of that. Yarosh Dmytro: Yarosh is the leader of the far-right Ukrainian nationalist group Pravy Sektor and candidate for the countrys May 25 presidential elections. The former Soviet soldiers fiery brand of politics and belief in the usefulness of militant action has made him an easy target of the Kremlin. Ahead of Moscows de facto annexation of Crimea Russian officials warned of the danger by the creeping fascism of Ukrainian nationalists like Yarosh to ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. In the wake of a deadly shootout in eastern Ukraine this weekend Russian media pinned the attack on Yarosh and Pravy Sektor. A spokesman for the group rejected the charge as absurd. Yatsenyuk Arseniy: Current prime minister of Ukraine and leader of Yulia Tymoshenko 's Fatherland party. In a leaked phone call between Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt Nuland and Pyatt agreed that Yatsenyuk had good economic experience .
