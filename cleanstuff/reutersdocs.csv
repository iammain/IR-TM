"Putin_critic_Navalny_gets_reprieve_as_court_finds_fault_with_case",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_15_36_46_GMT",""","Putin critic Navalny gets reprieve as court finds fault with case Opposition leader Alexei Navalny talks to the media after leaving a justice court building in Moscow April 22 2014. MOSCOW (Reuters) - A prominent foe of Vladimir Putin won an unexpected judicial respite on Monday when a Moscow court questioned a theft case he sees as the president's revenge for his activism and sent it back to prosecutors for overhaul. The ruling means the second trial of Alexei Navalny who is serving a five-year suspended sentence on a 2013 theft will be put off until prosecutors remove flaws in their case. But it leaves plenty of pressure on Navalny who is under house arrest and is barred from seeking office for years due to the conviction. An avid blogger who built his reputation with an on-line campaign against state corruption he is prohibited from blogging but has supporters posting on his behalf. Navalny said he had no doubt the trial would eventually go ahead. "The court and the prosecutors are just being extra-careful" state-run news agency Rapsi quoted Navalny as saying. Navalny a leader of protests that shook the Kremlin in 2011-2012 could be jailed for years if found guilty of stealing more than 30 million rubles ($832700) from two companies one of them an affiliate of French cosmetics firm Yves Rocher. He and his brother Oleg who is also charged deny guilt. Putting off the trial removes a cause for protests in Russia and for Western criticism at a time when Moscow's relations with the United States and European Union are badly strained over the turmoil in Ukraine and Russia's annexation of the Crimea region last month. The judge's ruling granting Navalny's motion to return the case to prosecutors came at a preliminary hearing on the same day that the United States imposed new sanctions on several Russian officials and companies close to Putin over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.

"North_Korea_says_army_must_develop_to_be_able_to_beat_U.S.",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_03_50_57_GMT",""","North Korea says army must develop to be able to beat U.S. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (C) guides the multiple-rocket launching drill of women's sub-units under KPA Unit 851 in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) April 24 2014. SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un urged the army to develop to ensure it wins any confrontation with the United States the reclusive country's news agency said on Sunday a day after U.S. President Barack Obama warned the North of its military might. Kim led a meeting of the Central Military Commission and "set forth important tasks for further developing the Korean People's Army and ways to do so" KCNA news agency said. "He stressed the need to enhance the function and role of the political organs of the army if it is to preserve the proud history and tradition of being the army of the party win one victory after another in the confrontation with the U.S. and creditably perform the mission as a shock force and standard-bearer in building a thriving nation." Obama said on Saturday on a visit to Seoul where the U.S. army has a large presence that the United States did not use its military might to "impose things" on others but that it would use that might if necessary to defend South Korea from any attack by the reclusive North. North and South Korea are still technically at war after their 1950-53 civil conflict ended in a mere truce. The impoverished North which routinely threatens the United States and the South with destruction warned last month it would not rule out a "new form" of atomic test after the U.N. Security Council condemned Pyongyang's launch of a mid-range ballistic missile into the sea east of the Korean peninsula. North Korea is already subject to U.N. sanctions over its previous three atomic tests. Recent satellite data shows continued work at the nuclear test site in North Korea although experts analyzing the data say that preparations do not appear to have progressed far enough for an imminent test. "We don't use our military might to impose these things on others but we will not hesitate to use our military might to defend our allies and our way of life" Obama told U.S. forces at the Yongsan garrison. "So like all nations on Earth North Korea and its people have a choice. They can choose to continue down a lonely road of isolation or they can choose to join the rest of the world and seek a future of greater opportunity and greater security and greater respect - a future that already exists for the citizens on the southern end of the Korean peninsula."

The United States is capable of wasting the entire North Korean Military with extremely small loses. Human wave attacks like those in the good old days of the Korean War would result in near 100 percent casualties for the North Koreans. Their armored divisions would be turned into molten slag in the first week of hostilities and that sorry excuse for an Air Force would lose every aircraft launched and nearly all that remain on the ground in their shelters. What would happen is that North Korea would lose almost all of its military hardware and a huge percentage of its military personel. Then without the military to keep the North Korean people under control we would supply them with arms with which to execute a regime change. OK fat boy do you feel lucky?

"Obama_says_U.S._committed_to_supporting_MH370_search",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_07_22_00_GMT",""","A woman holds a sign before U.S. President Barack Obama's arrival at the Young Southeast Asian Leadership Intiative (YSEALI) Town Hall at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur April 27 2014. KUALA LUMPUR/PERTH Australia (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Sunday that the United States was fully committed to providing more assets to assist in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean. "I can tell you the United States is absolutely committed to providing whatever resources and assets that we can" Obama told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. A U.S. Navy submersible drone scanned a remote patch of the Indian Ocean seabed on Sunday in its so far fruitless efforts to find signs of the missing plane but bad weather prevented an air and sea surface search. More than seven weeks after the jet carrying 239 people disappeared enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and six weeks since the search moved from Asia to the Indian Ocean authorities are now regrouping to decide how to proceed. "We are currently consulting very closely with our international partners on the best way to continue the search into the future" the Joint Agency Coordination Centre in charge of the search told Reuters in an email. Malaysia China Japan New Zealand South Korea Britain and the United States are assisting Australia in trying to solve the most expensive search in aviation history. "Obviously we don't know all the details but we do know if in fact the plane went down in the ocean on this part of this world there is a big place and it is very challenging effort and laboriously effort" Obama said. "It is going to take quite some time." A U.S. defense official told Reuters on Friday that the sea search is likely to drag on for years as it enters the much more difficult phase of scouring broader areas of the ocean near where the plane is believed to have crashed. Australia and Malaysia are under pressure to bring closure to the grieving families of those on board MH370 which disappeared on March 8 by finding wreckage to determine what happened to the aircraft. Malaysia is also under growing pressure to improve its disclosure about its investigation although Obama said on Sunday that U.S. authorities had found it to be "fully forthcoming" in sharing information. Najib has said his government would make public a preliminary report into the plane's disappearance next week. Last week Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters that authorities would be "increasing the assets that are available for deep-sea search" and that his government was seeking help from state oil company Petronas which has expertise in deep-sea exploration. The empty expanse of water some 1000 miles northwest of Western Australia's state capital Perth is one of the most remote places in the world and also one of the deepest. Until now the undersea search has been focused on a 10 square km (6.2 square mile) circular zone where a series of "pings" detected earlier this month led authorities to believe the plane's black box flight recorders may be located. The undersea search is set to be extended beyond this small area if the U.S. Bluefin-21 drone fails to find anything the search authority said on Saturday.

"New_group_CubaNow_tells_Obama_it_s_time_to_change_Cuba_policy",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_21_12_09_GMT",""","New group #CubaNow tells Obama it's time to change Cuba policy 1 of 5. A poster depicting U.S. President Barack Obama is seen above a passing train at the McPherson Square Metro stop in Washington April 28 2014. MIAMI (Reuters) - A new advocacy group calling for the United States to change its policy toward Cuba launched an advertising campaign on Monday with posters on the Washington D.C. metro system showing President Barack Obama and urging him to "stop waiting." The metro ads by the group #CubaNow are designed to highlight economic changes happening in Cuba. The group believes the 52-year-old U.S. embargo against the communist-ruled island has not worked. "It's time to bring the conversation on U.S.-Cuba policy into the 21st century" said #CubaNow director Ric Herrero. The group said its mission unlike other Cuba policy groups was specifically focused on changing U.S. thinking about Cuba policy. While the group opposes the embargo it recognized that overturning it in Congress is an uphill battle and other ways can be found to change policy such as allowing all Americans to travel to Cuba. "There's plenty the President can do within his existing authority" said #CubaNow founding member Andres Daz a Cuban-born former Obama administration official at the Department of Commerce. #CubaNow was founded by a group of mostly younger generation Cuban Americans. Herrero declined to discuss its funding. The group's launch coincides with the fifth anniversary of Obama's 2009 steps allowing Cuban-Americans to travel freely to visit relatives in Cuba as well as send remittances. That policy shift helped "usher in more change in that time than had been seen in the previous 50 years" the group said in a press release. Herrero said the group based in Miami and Washington wants the White House to take "new steps" to encourage Cuba's burgeoning private sector which has emerged under economic reforms being slowly introduced by the Cuban government. Cuba announced new reforms on Monday loosening regulation of its largest state-run companies including minerals tourism and telecommunications. The group's founding is part of a new wave of efforts to prod Obama into taking bolder steps to engage the Cuban government. It follows a February poll by the Atlantic Council which found a majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba. In November Obama told a Miami area fundraiser that it may be time for the United States to "update" its policies toward Cuba. "Blue jeans and rockn roll brought down the Berlin Wall so we have to recognize that there is a new wave of energy pushing a new approach toward U.S.-Cuba policy" said Alex Castellanos a Republican political strategist who is Cuban American.

How can the US engage so openly with the Chinese communist regime (which has an equally poor if not more serious record of human rights violations than the Castro government) and then continue to punish Cubans for clinging to the same communist system? It is far more effective to engage your neighbors rather than to punish them (the population collectively I might add) over archaic Cold War sentiments that are completely non-sensical and absurd this day and age. So they want to take the heat off the embargo and concentrate on The embargo is a moral abomination that been repeatedly condemned even by the USAs closest allies at the UN and by groups like Amnesty International. Targeting every man woman and child on the island as it does it is morally and legally a form of genocide. The elephant in the room but that is the point that must be driven home to American voters.

On a visit to Malaysia Obama praised political reforms under way in once-isolated Myanmar but said the danger of democratization was that it could unleash religious and ethnic conflicts and that such developments could move Myanmar in a bad direction. "You have a Muslim minority (in Myanmar) that the broader population has historically looked down upon and whose rights are not being fully protected" Obama told a townhall-style meeting of young leaders from across Southeast Asia. "Myanmar won't succeed if the Muslim population is oppressed."

"Obama_arrives_in_Manila_as_Philippines_U.S._sign_security_pact",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_09_02_03_GMT",""","Obama hails security pact with Philippines says no threat to China 1 of 3. U.S. President Barack Obama walks with President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines at the Malacanang Palace in Manila April 28 2014. U.S. removes Philippines from copyright blacklist Mon Apr 28 2014 MANILA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said a new military pact signed with the Philippines on Monday granting a larger presence for U.S. forces would bolster the Southeast Asian country's maritime security but was not aimed at countering China's growing military might. The agreement which will have an initial 10-year term was touted as the highlight of Obama's first visit to the Philippines the United States' oldest ally in the region. It sets the framework for a beefed-up rotation of U.S. troops ships and warplanes through the Philippines part of a rebalancing of U.S. resources towards fast-growing Asia and the Pacific. But China interprets the move as an attempt to contain its increasing military capability and embolden Manila in a decades-long territorial dispute with Beijing. "The goal for this agreement is to build Philippine capacity to engage in training engage in coordination not simply to deal with issues of maritime security but also to enhance our capabilities so that if there is a natural disaster that takes place we can respond quickly" Obama told a joint news conference in Manila after talks with President Benigno Aquino. "Our goal is not to counter China our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make sure that international rules and norms are respected and that includes the area of maritime disputes." He reiterated Washington's support for Manila's move to seek international arbitration over conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea an important shipping route that is believed to be rich in energy resources. REGIONAL TENSIONS The Philippines is the last stop on a week-long tour of Asia partly aimed at reassuring U.S. allies that Washington remains committed to its strategic "pivot" to the region. Obama said all four countries he has visited including Japan which has its own dispute with China over tiny islands in the East China Sea were committed to seeking a peaceful resolution of territorial issues. China claims about 90 percent of the South China Sea a claim that overlaps with those of the Philippines Brunei Malaysia Vietnam and Taiwan. China has rejected international arbitration preferring a bilateral route to solving the jurisdictional disputes. Rising regional tensions were highlighted by a commentary from China's state news agency Xinhua criticizing the pact. "Given that the Philippines is at a bitter territorial row with China the move is particularly disturbing as it may embolden Manila in dealing with Beijing" the commentary said. "A more assertive or even reckless Manila would stoke regional tensions and in turn upset Obama's policy of rebalancing." Aquino said China "shouldn't be concerned" about the new agreement which is aimed at increasing joint military training especially for disaster relief operations. The United States and the Philippines will hold joint exercises next week in areas mostly north of the capital. "We are not a threat militarily to any country we don't even have ... presently a single fighter aircraft in our inventory" Aquino said adding his country had "legitimate needs" to protect its 36000 km (22370 miles) coastline. NO NEW BASES The United States was not seeking to rebuild old military bases or construct new ones under the agreement said Obama who was greeted with a 21-gun salute upon his arrival at the presidential palace in the former U.S. colony. Dozens of anti-U.S. protesters shouted slogans and waved banners to protest against his visit outside the palace. The United States had maintained two military bases northwest of Manila including Subic Bay which was once its biggest overseas naval base until the Philippine Senate ordered U.S. troops to leave in 1991. Eight years later the Senate approved an agreement providing for temporary visits by U.S. forces allowing the staging of joint military exercises. Officials said the new security accord did not specify the number of U.S. troops and equipment to be deployed in the country with those details to be discussed separately by the two governments. "They can do construction and upgrade of infrastructure they can store or preposition defense equipment supplies and material as well as hard equipment and supplies" said Lourdes Yparraguirre Philippine ambassador to Austria and a member of the negotiating panel that worked on the deal for eight months. "China was never discussed in the negotiations" she told reporters on the sidelines of a signing ceremony hours before Obama's arrival. "We don't aim to contain or confront anyone. I hope that our neighbors in the region would also view this agreement as a positive contribution to peace stability security and prosperity in the region." While some analysts believe the new military agreement with Washington raises Manila's military capabilities others think it will create more problems for the country. "Relations with China...will deteriorate further in the context of maritime disputes. China is averse to any Philippine government initiative to involve the U.S. in its security agenda" said Rommel Banlaoi analyst at the Center for Intelligence and National Security in Manila. "We are strengthening our relationship with the U.S. at the expense of our relationship with China" he said.

"Obama_announces_new_U.S._sanctions_on_Russia_over_Ukraine",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_10_05_02_GMT",""","1 of 25. Pro-Russian men attack pro-Ukrainian supporters during a pro-Ukrainian rally in Donetsk eastern Ukraine April 28 2014. U.S. imposes sanctions against 7 Russians 17 companies linked to Putin New U.S. sanctions on Putin allies cause few ripples Mon Apr 28 2014 White House casts Russia sanctions strategy as battle of attrition Mon Apr 28 2014 DONETSK/SLAVIANSK Ukraine (Reuters) - The United States imposed new sanctions on allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday prompting Moscow to denounce "Cold War" tactics amid more violence in eastern Ukraine. The move to ban visas and freeze assets of the likes of Putin's friend Igor Sechin head of oil giant Rosneft also drew fire from President Barack Obama's domestic critics who called it a "slap on the wrist." EU states added 15 more Russians and Ukrainians to their blacklist and will reveal them on Tuesday. The new round of U.S. sanctions following those imposed last month when Russia annexed Crimea barely registered in eastern Ukraine where pro-Moscow rebels were holding a group of German and other OSCE military observers for a fourth day. Despite a Ukrainian military operation to contain them the militants extended their grip by seizing key public buildings in another town in the Donetsk region. In the regional capital Donetsk club-wielding pro-Russian activists broke up a rally by supporters of the Western-backed government in Kiev. The high-profile mayor of Kharkiv Ukraine's second city was badly wounded by a gunman raising fears of further unrest in a Russian-speaking region that has seen less trouble of late than the neighboring provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. U.S. sanctions were aimed Washington officials said at "cronies" of Putin. Seven men including Sechin were targeted by visa bans and freezing of any U.S. assets and 17 companies were also named. "The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally" Obama said. "The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul." Washington will also deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities and revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions the White House said. In addition to Sechin the Russians sanctioned by the United States included another Putin ally Sergei Chemezov head of Rostec a Russian state-owned high-tech products company. The others named were Oleg Belavencev Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea Dmitry Kozak deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation Evgeniy Murov director of Russia's federal protective service Aleksei Pushkov a state Duma deputy and Vyacheslav Volodin a Putin adviser. Not included was Gazprom chief Alexei Miller a close ally of Putin who had been seen as a possible target. Obama is under pressure from opposition Republicans at home to move faster on sanctions. But in taking what he described as "calibrated steps" he has emphasized a need to act in concert with European countries which have more at stake economically and a more cumbersome process for taking decisions. There was little prospect of a change in the calculus for Putin who critics say is stirring up fear among ethnic Russians in order to redraw post-Soviet borders and rebuild Moscow's empire. "Washington is in effect reviving ... an old method of restricting normal cooperation from Cold War times essentially chasing itself into a dark dusty closet of a bygone era" said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov describing the sanctions as illegitimate uncivilized and in breach of international law. In an hour-long phone call with U.S. Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu voiced concern about an "unprecedented" increase in U.S. and NATO activity near Russia's borders and urged Hagel to help "turn down the rhetoric" over Ukraine Moscow's Defense Ministry said. RALLY ATTACKED Both sides continue to offer diametrically mirror-image versions of events in Ukraine. The West sees the pro-Western leaders who took power after Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovich fled to Russia in February as legitimate and believes Putin is trying to undermine their efforts to hold an election. For Moscow they are "fascists" and "putschists" anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalists against whom the Russian speakers of Crimea and the east have risen up in self-defence - a view it broadcasts into Ukraine on state-run Russian media. Opinion polls show substantial but still only minority support in the depressed industrial east of Ukraine for it to follow Crimea into union with Russia. Several people were injured on Monday after dozens of men in military fatigues carrying baseball bats and throwing firecrackers tried to break up a demonstration in Donetsk. A crowd of about 2000 waved Ukrainian flags and chanted: "Donetsk is Ukraine" and "Putin no" but they dispersed after the assault in which Reuters journalists saw at least 10 people treated for head injuries. Earlier in the same region armed men in camouflage who refused to identify themselves seized the police station and town hall in Kostyantynivka. Reuters journalists saw about 20 well-organized gunmen controlling the administration building. They erected a barricade of tires sandbags and concrete blocks. Soviet songs played over loudspeakers and women gathered signatures in support of an uprising against rule from Kiev. Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes a colorful and well-known figure nationwide was shot in the back while out exercising and doctors are battling to save his life. Kernes 54 is a member of the party through which Yanukovich and fellow easterners had dominated a Ukrainian system widely seen as deeply corrupt. Among the most prominent Jewish politicians in the country who earned his wealth from business dealings in the crime-ridden 1990s Kernes had called for Kharkiv to quit Ukraine after Yanukovich fell but had lately clamped down on separatists. The government said police were looking into whether the assassination attempt was linked to the arrest of pro-Russian separatists on Sunday. GERMAN HOSTAGES Although Russia signed a deal with Ukraine and Kiev's U.S. and EU allies at Geneva 10 days ago under which militants should surrender to OSCE monitors it flatly denies Ukrainian and Western assertions it is controlling the militants' activities and that it has special forces orchestrating events on the ground. "Russia's involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable" a White House statement said. After an appeal from Germany long Moscow's firmest advocate in the West for Russia to intervene to secure the release of the seven European monitors four of whom are German Moscow's ambassador to the OSCE said it would be good if they were freed. But he also condemned the OSCE of which Russia is a member for being "extremely irresponsible" in sending them to eastern Ukraine. Moscow has condemned the Kiev authorities for failing to provide security in the industrial and heavily populated east close to the Russian border. In the face of Western and Ukrainian calls for it to pull back troops massed on Ukraine's frontier the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday it had "deep concern" about forces Kiev has sent to the region suggesting that Ukrainian troops might be preparing for "the destruction of entire cities". In the separatist military stronghold at Slaviansk the self-declared mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov said he had given OSCE mediators a list of detainees his movement wanted freed by Kiev in return for the OSCE observers he is holding. The Russian Foreign Ministry said the jailed leader of an earlier separatist protest in Donetsk was on hunger strike to protest against his torture. It also cited reports that Ukraine was building detention centers "very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps" for "dissenting citizens" in the east. The Moscow stock market shrugged off the sanctions rising almost 1 percent when they failed to penalize more companies. Although its chief executive Sechin was hit by a visa ban few expected Rosneft or its international partners to suffer much though its shares lost 1.7 percent on the day. Western countries say sanctions are already having an effect on Russia by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The central bank has raised interest rates to support the ruble and Russian firms are finding it harder to raise funds.

"Obama_reaffirms_commitment_to_Japan_on_tour_of_Asia_allies",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_13_12_21_GMT",""","Obama reaffirms commitment to Japan on tour of Asia allies 1 of 8. U.S. President Barack Obama shakes hands with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (R) at a joint news conference at the Akasaka Palace in Tokyo April 24 2014. TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama assured ally Japan on Thursday that Washington was committed to its defense including of tiny isles at the heart of a row with China but denied he had drawn any new "red line" and urged peaceful dialogue over the islands. His comments drew a swift response from China which said the disputed islets were Chinese territory. Obama also urged Japan to take "bold steps" to clinch a two-way trade pact seen as crucial to a broad regional agreement that is a central part of the U.S. leader's "pivot" of military diplomatic and economic resources towards Asia and the Pacific. U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators failed to resolve differences in time for Obama and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to shake hands on a deal at the summit. The leaders reported progress but Japan's economics minister Akira Amari said later that remaining sticking points could not be resolved quickly. Obama on the start of a four-nation tour is being treated to a display of pomp and ceremony meant to show that the U.S.-Japan alliance the main pillar of America's security strategy in Asia is solid at a time of rising tensions over growing Chinese assertiveness and North Korean nuclear threats. "We don't take a position on final sovereignty determinations with respect to Senkaku but historically they have been administered by Japan and we do not believe that they should be subject to change unilaterally and what is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by Japan" Obama said. "This is not a new position this is a consistent one" he told a joint news conference after his summit with Abe using the Japanese name for the islands that China which also claims sovereignty over them calls the Diaoyu. "In our discussions I emphasized with Prime Minister Abe the importance of resolving this issue peacefully" Obama added. Whilst his comments amounted to a restatement of longstanding U.S. policy there was symbolism in the commitment being stated explicitly by a U.S. president in Japan. Responding to Obama's remarks Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a daily press briefing in Beijing that the islands belonged to China. "The so-called U.S.-Japan security treaty is a product of the Cold War era and it cannot be aimed at a third party and ought not to harm China's territorial sovereignty" he said. "No matter what anyone says or does it cannot change the basic reality that the Diaoyu Islands are China's inherent territory and cannot shake the resolve and determination of the Chinese government and people to protect (our) sovereignty and maritime rights." INTERNATIONAL RULES Obama also said there were opportunities to work with China - which complains that his real aim is to contain its rise - but called on the Asian power to stick to international rules. "What we've also emphasized and I will continue to emphasize throughout this trip is that all of us have responsibilities to help maintain basic rules of the world and international order so that large countries small countries all have to abide by what is considered just and fair" he said. Some of China's neighbors with territorial disputes with Beijing worry that Obama's apparent inability to rein in Russia which annexed Crimea last month could send a message of weakness to China. Obama told the news conference that additional sanctions were "teed up" against Russia if it does not deliver on promises in an agreement reached in Geneva last week to ease tensions in Ukraine. Obama and Abe also agreed that their top trade aides U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Amari would keep trying to narrow gaps in their trade talks. "This is not something we can reach a conclusion (on) in a short period of time" Amari told reporters after meeting Froman again after the leaders' summit. Abe has touted the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as key to the "Third Arrow" of his economic program to reinvigorate the world's third-biggest economy along with hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending. Both sides have also stressed that the TPP would have strategic implications by creating a framework for business that could entice China to play by global rules. But the talks have been stymied by Japan's efforts to protect politically powerful agriculture sectors such as beef and disputes over both countries' auto markets. Pointing to restrictions on access to Japan's farm and auto sectors Obama said: "Those are all issues that people are all familiar with and at some point have to be resolved. I believe that point is now." Experts had said failure to reach a final deal could cast doubts on Abe's commitment to economic reform and take the wind out of the sails of a drive for a broader TPP agreement. "If they don't show progress ... it will be harder to use TPP as a spur to reforms" said Robert Feldman a managing director at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities in Tokyo. "It gives the anti-reform forces aid and comfort." DIPLOMATIC CHALLENGE The diplomatic challenge for Obama during his week-long four-nation regional tour is to convince Asian partners that Washington is serious about its promised strategic "pivot" while at the same time not harming U.S. ties with China the world's second-biggest economy. Obama will also travel to South Korea Malaysia and the Philippines. Abe - who repeatedly referred to the U.S. president as "Barack" during their news conference - and Obama were keen to send a message of solidarity after U.S-Japan ties were strained by Abe's December visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine seen by critics as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Japan lobbied hard to get the White House to agree to an official state visit the first by a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton in 1996. Abe is trying to soothe U.S. concerns that his conservative push to recast Japan's war record with a less apologetic tone is overshadowing pragmatic policies on the economy and security. "Seventy years ago when the war ended Japan gave grave damage and pain to many people particularly people in Asia. Japan started taking post-war steps by reflecting on this. Japan and Japanese people have continued to take the path of peace for the past 70 years" Abe told the joint news conference. "Japan has strived to create a free and democratic country after the war. We have been building a country that respects human rights and the rule of law" he said.

"Exclusive_EU_considers_ban_on_deals_with_banks_in_Crimea",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_13_33_35_GMT",""","Exclusive: EU considers ban on deals with banks in Crimea An European Union flag hangs outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels February 13 2014. BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union may ban transactions with financial institutions in Crimea as part of its response to the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula by Russia last month an EU document obtained by Reuters showed. EU leaders consider the takeover as illegal and have asked the EU executive arm the European Commission to propose economic trade and financial restrictions on Crimea for rapid implementation. These proposals are separate from an EU discussion on stepped-up sanctions against Russia if Moscow does not help deescalate tensions in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and the government in Kiev. The document spelt out some of the practical difficulties involved in implementing sanctions specifically against Crimea now that it is de facto a part of Russia. "Solutions need to be found that at the same time support the territorial integrity of Ukraine do not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea defend European interests in this region and do not penalize the Crimean people" the Commission said in a document prepared for EU governments to consider. One way to discourage or penalize financial institutions in Crimea that cooperated with the annexation could be to restrict capital movements between the EU and those banks it said and bar EU citizens or businesses from carrying out transactions with them. "The same could hold for prohibiting investments by Crimean investors (companies located or registered in Crimea) into the EU and by EU investors into Crimean entities" it said. The Commission proposals are still under review and a decision whether to follow them is likely to be taken by EU foreign ministers whose next meeting is on May 12. Out of Crimea's 1000 bank branches around 60 were owned by EU banks the Commission said. Italy's Unicredit had 20 Austria's Raiffeisen had 32 and Hungarian OTP had six the Commission said. However Raiffeisen closed its operations in Crimea in early April it said and Unicredit wants to transfer its Crimea branches to its Russian subsidiary. "Russian banks are gradually taking over in Crimea but the main Russian banks (Sberbank and VTB ) reportedly are reluctant to do so for fear of becoming subject to European or U.S. sanctions" the Commission document said. NO PREFERENTIAL TRADE TERMS The Commission noted that by the end of April Ukrainian exporters will be in a position to trade under two preferential arrangements with the EU and enjoy significant tariff reductions. But the exporters need to have a certificate of origin for their goods and Ukraine will stop issuing such certificates to companies based in Crimea. However the Commission document noted that there was practically no way to prevent Crimean products from being exported to the EU via Russia unless they were clearly of Crimean origin like wine. The only way to guarantee an absolute ban on imports from Crimea would be to suspend trade with Russia entirely the document said - an option which it made clear was not feasible. "In addition to the political consequences this would have such a ban would also involve legal risks as it would require justification under World Trade Organisation law. A more practical option would consist in limiting the ban on import only to the products of clear Crimean origin such as wines." Crimea has taken ownership of Ukraine's state companies on its territory including the region's Black Sea natural gas fields. Black Sea gas production is currently only one billion cubic meters per year but Ukraine had hoped it would increase to 3 billion cubic meters in 2015 and it had attracted foreign investors including majors Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. The paper said Crimea residents would have to apply for visas to the EU through Kiev because allowing them to apply via an EU consulate in Moscow would amount to indirect recognition of the illegal annexation. The Commission also proposed that EU countries should not recognize passports issued by Russia to Crimea residents after the annexation.

Only Russians can decide when they want to live in peace with the world they must get rid of dictator rasPutin. Revolution in Moscow this August. It is coming. How stupid can the EU be. The event in Ukraine are motivated by pure economic interests of the US. But the sad thing is it is going to be Europe that would end up paying price for this misadventure. In addition to EU being made to bear the cost of stabalizing Ukraine after the messed-up situation there the imminent incraese in cost of gas will be a double whammy for European nations. On one hand it will make manufacturing even less competitive compared to China and the US (which is expereincing a revival thanks to cheaper energy costs due to shale revolution) and secondly it will increase costs of living further crimping any revival in consumer spending. With massive youth unemplyment and under-employment Europe does not need a manufactured US crisis. Unless European leaders have already decided that turning Europe into a war-zone will provide more fruitful employment to youth than any other option with them. It is time for EU to disassociate itself from events where escalation in any form will only benefit American interests while making Europe even weaker and dependent on the US. That would mean Europe ending up buying expensive US shale gas European manufacturing being further decimated American exporters will be happy to fill this gap .And Europe will end up stationing even more US troops. East-ward expansion of NATO/EU ensures that Americans can piggy-back on the more insecure setiments of Eastern European nations and will continue to have leverage in European affairs.

"Ukraine_forces_kill_up_to_five_rebels_Russia_starts_drill_near_border",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_15_53_53_GMT",""","Ukraine forces kill up to five rebels Russia starts drill near border 1 of 12. Ukrainian soldiers stand guard at a checkpoint in the village of Malinivka east of Slaviansk in eastern Ukraine April 24 2014. Ukraine forces kill up to five rebels Russia starts drill near border Kerry: window closing for Russia to change course in Ukraine Thu Apr 24 2014 Hagel says Russian actions on Ukraine border worrisome Thu Apr 24 2014 Russia demands U.S. stop Ukraine's military operation Thu Apr 24 2014 US slams new Russian military exercises near Ukraine Thu Apr 24 2014 SLAVIANSK Ukraine/ST PETERSBURG Russia (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces killed up to five pro-Moscow rebels on Thursday as they closed in on the separatists' military stronghold in the east and Russia launched army drills near the border in response raising fears its troops would invade. The Ukrainian offensive amounts to the first time Kiev's troops have used lethal force to recapture territory from the fighters who have seized swathes of eastern Ukraine since April 6 and proclaimed an independent "People's Republic of Donetsk". Ukraine's acting president accused Moscow of supporting "terrorism at the state level" against his country for backing the rebels who the government blames for kidnapping and torturing a politician found dead on Saturday. The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said its forces backed by the army had removed three checkpoints manned by armed groups in the  city of Slaviansk. "During the armed clash up to five terrorists were eliminated" it said in a statement adding that one person had been wounded on the side of the government forces. A rebel spokeswoman in Slaviansk said two fighters had died in a clash in the same area northeast of the city center. Slaviansk's separatist self-proclaimed mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov quoted on a local news site said one man was shot dead and another badly wounded on the northeastern outskirts of the city. He said the dead had been unarmed. The Kremlin which says it has the right to invade its neighbor to protect Russian speakers has built up forces on Ukraine's border - estimated by NATO at up to 40000 troops. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu announced Moscow had launched military drills near the border in response to "Ukraine's military machine" and NATO exercises in eastern Europe. Kiev demanded an explanation within 48 hours of action on the border. Russia already seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine last month after President Vladimir Putin overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy by announcing the right to use military force in neighboring countries. An invasion of mainland Ukraine's industrial heartland would be a far more serious action. It had seemed beyond contemplation only weeks ago but now looks like a real threat although the full extent of Putin's territorial ambitions remains a mystery. In St Petersburg Putin said that if the authorities in Kiev had used the army in eastern Ukraine it would be a very serious crime against their own people. "It is just a punitive operation and it will of course incur consequences for the people making these decisions including (an effect) on our interstate relations" Putin said in a televised meeting with regional media. Washington criticized the Russian drills on the frontier. It was "exactly the opposite of what we have been calling on the Russians to do which is to de-escalate the situation" Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said. Russia's Foreign Ministry responded that it was up to Washington to halt the Ukrainian military action and "force the Kiev authorities who are wards of the United States to restrain themselves and not use force." Reuters journalists saw a Ukrainian detachment with five armored personnel carriers take over a checkpoint on a road north of Slaviansk in the late morning after it was abandoned by separatists who set tires alight to cover their retreat. However two hours later the troops pulled back and it was unclear if Kiev would risk storming Slaviansk a city of 130000 that has become the military stronghold of a movement seeking annexation by Moscow of Ukraine's industrialized east. "FINISH WHAT WE HAVE STARTED" At another checkpoint set up by the Ukrainian military a soldier said they were there to instill law and order. "Those separatists they violated the constitution they are torturing the country they violated laws they do not recognize the authority of police so the army had to move in and we will finish what we have started so help me God" he said. Under an accord signed by Russia Ukraine the United States and European Union in Geneva last week illegal armed groups are supposed to disarm and go home including the rebels occupying about a dozen buildings in the largely Russian-speaking east. However the rebels have shown no sign of retreating. U.S. President Barack Obama blamed Russia for failing to carry out the Geneva deal and said he was ready to impose new sanctions. Putin said sanctions were "dishonorable" and destroyed the global economy but that so far the damage had not been critical. Moscow also flexed its economic muscles with the government suggesting foreign firms which pull out of the country may not be able to get back in. A source at Gazprom said the Russian exporter had slapped an additional $11.4 billion bill on Kiev. Ukraine is negotiating to reverse east-west pipelines so that it can receive gas from Europe if Moscow cuts it off. Washington accuses Moscow of sending agents to coordinate the unrest in the east as it did before seizing Crimea last month. Russia denies it is behind the uprising and says the separatists are responding spontaneously to hostility from Kiev. Russia made similar denials over Crimea until Putin acknowledged last week his troops had indeed acted alongside local militia. "At the state level Russia is supporting terrorism in our country" Ukraine's acting President Oleksander Turchinov said in an address to the nation on Thursday. "Armed criminals have taken over buildings are taking citizens Ukrainian and foreign journalists hostage and murdering Ukrainian patriots." Turchinov called for the eastern offensive this week after the apparent torture and murder of a pro-Kiev town councilor whose body was found on Saturday near Slaviansk. Volodymyr Rybak had disappeared after being filmed trying to take down a separatist flag while trying to enter the rebel-held town hall where he worked in Horlivka a town near Slaviansk. "He was bruised and punctured from head to toe...it's clear they tortured him" said Aleksander Yaroshenko a family friend who accompanied Rybak's widow when she identified his body at the morgue. "The police have lots of details they have CCTV footage they should know who did this" he told Reuters. Rebels in Slaviansk released U.S. citizen Simon Ostrovsky one of three journalists they are believed to be holding. Moscow called for Kiev to release "political prisoners" including a pro-Russian activist named Pavel Gubarev. U.S. TROOPS ARRIVE IN POLAND So far the United States and EU have taken only mild action against Moscow imposing visa bans and asset freezes on a few Russians measures Moscow has scoffed at as meaningless. Washington and Brussels both say they are drafting more serious sanctions and will impose them if the Geneva deal collapses. Even without serious sanctions Russia's confrontation with the West has hurt its economy as fearful investors send their money abroad. Mutual funds specializing in Russia and Eastern Europe were the 30 worst performers out of 3489 equity funds for sale in Britain in the three months ending in March. In NATO member Poland the first group of a contingent of around 600 U.S. soldiers arrived on Wednesday part of an effort by Washington to reassure eastern European allies who are worried by the Russian build-up near Ukraine's borders. However NATO and the United States have made clear they will not use military force to protect Ukraine itself. Shoigu the Russian defence minister said aircraft would fly increased patrols near the Ukrainian frontier as part of the new exercises. Two local residents in the area told Reuters they had seen attack helicopters flying in formation. Kiev said the city hall in another eastern town Mariupol which had been seized was back under central control. A separatist crowd later surrounded the building patrolled by police but otherwise apparently empty. Kiev also reported a shootout overnight in another part of the east where a Ukrainian soldier was wounded. Ukraine a former Soviet republic slid into unrest late last year when Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich rejected a pact to build closer ties with Europe. Protesters took over central Kiev and he fled in February. Days later Russian troops seized control of Crimea. The Ukrainian defence ministry confirmed its involvement in the operation around Slaviansk on Thursday saying the troops involved were airborne units with experience of such tasks from international peacekeeping missions. "The morale of our forces will allow them to completely fulfill their task of defending Ukraine" it said. Unarmed mediators from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe are in eastern Ukraine trying to persuade pro-Russian gunmen to go home in line with the Geneva accord. Reuters reporters have not been able to establish that any Russian troops or special forces members are on the ground though Kiev and Western powers say they have growing evidence that Moscow has a presence. Masked gunmen in the east widely referred to as "green men" wear uniforms without insignia. Kiev has been cautious in taking action for fear of triggering a Russian invasion. Last week it ordered an "anti-terrorist operation" but this quickly fizzled out when an armored column of paratroopers surrendered weapons to a separatist crowd.

"Russia_says_Marshall_Islands_nuclear_lawsuits_baseless",""_Mon_28_Apr_2014_19_41_11_GMT",""","This U.S. Navy handout image shows Baker the second of the two atomic bomb tests in which a 63-kiloton warhead was exploded 90 feet under water as part of Operation Crossroads conducted at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 to measure nuclear weapon effects on warships. MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday that lawsuits in which the Marshall Islands accused nine nations with nuclear weapons capability of failing in their obligation to negotiate disarmament are "baseless" and would not help rid the world of atomic weapons. The tiny archipelago nation in the Pacific Ocean which was used for U.S. nuclear tests in the 1950s filed lawsuits last week against the United States Russia and seven other countries. The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed surprise at the allegation saying the Cold War arms race was decades in the past and that Russia and the United States had been negotiating nuclear cuts almost constantly for years. "As a result ... Russia has reduced its strategic (long-range) nuclear potential by more than 80 percent and its non-strategic nuclear weapons by three-quarters from their peak numbers" the ministry said in a statement. "We are convinced that filing baseless suits does not foster a favorable conditions for further steps by the international community in the area of arms control and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction" it said. Russia said it had clearly shown it was abiding by the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). However it lamented that "for past 45 years the international community has made no serious efforts" to fulfill the treaty's obligation that signatories seek a pact on "complete disarmament under strict and effective international control". "The Russian Federation is open to interaction with its NPT partners with the aim of seeking the most effective paths to realization of the Treaty" it said. The comments were in line with statements by Russian officials that total disarmament is a good idea in theory. But Russia has also made clear it will not approve cuts below ceilings set in the 2010 New START treaty unless the United States addresses its concerns about U.S. missile defense and non-nuclear weapons capabilities among other things.

"Syrian_relief_work_hampered_by_U.N._failings_aid_groups_say",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_15_42_57_GMT",""","Syrian relief work hampered by U.N. failings aid groups say A United Nations vehicle towing a trailer with humanitarian aid arrives at a besieged area of Homs February 12 2014. BEIRUT (Reuters) - Aid organizations working in Syria say they are growing frustrated at how the United Nations is handling the world's biggest humanitarian crisis accusing it of excluding them and withholding information vital to assist millions in need. A letter obtained by Reuters which was sent to several U.N. Security Council members this month by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in Syria says a lack of coordination by the United Nations means assistance is not reaching some civilians in priority areas. In other regions of the country the U.N. does not inform other aid groups when it brings aid leading to "potential duplication" of deliveries the document said. Syria's war has killed 150000 people and poses an enormous challenge for relief workers. Nine million people inside the country need aid and protection industry and agriculture are failing and 2.5 million refugees have fled abroad. Funding shortfalls combined with restrictions imposed by Damascus and by the fighting have hampered relief efforts. But the NGOs suggested that shortcomings in the aid operations were aggravating the situation calling on the United Nations to demonstrate greater leadership improve coordination and demand better access. U.N. officials in New York Geneva and Damascus declined to comment on the NGO report but U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos has repeatedly said the Syrian government and rebels have not done enough to allow aid in to besieged areas. President Bashar al-Assad's forces and to a lesser extent rebels fighting to overthrow him have been accused of preventing food and medicine from reaching a quarter of a million people in besieged areas seeking to starve opponents into submission. Syrian authorities also frequently dictate how aid is distributed by U.N. agencies who are legally obliged to work with the country's authorities resulting in more supplies going to  areas aid workers say. Seeking to expand the humanitarian reach the U.N. Security Council agreed in February that all sides must allow greater access. But U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week none of Syria's warring parties was adhering to the demand. "WEAK U.N. SYSTEMS" Reuters spoke to three international aid organization that drafted the report to Security Council members. The organizations asked to remain anonymous citing fears that public disclosure would negatively affect their work in Syria. "U.N. agencies ... need to ensure better coordination and leadership" the report said. "Coordination between aid agencies operating from neighboring countries and those present in Damascus continues to be challenging with weak U.N. systems and insufficient capacity currently in place. "In Damascus NGOs are often excluded from decision-making processes related to the planning of aid convoys and discussions on aid delivery mechanisms" it said. The report said aid groups did not take part in a government and U.N. meetings during the evacuation of civilians from besieged areas of Homs city this year. That kind of exclusion means "that information and analysis from a broader range of aid actors are often not taken on board" it said. "Greater U.N. action to press for diplomatic support on key access issues is needed" it added repeating a long-standing criticism that the U.N. has not voiced concerns loud enough when Syrian authorities impede access such as restricting aid to besieged areas. Amos who is due to brief the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday has appealed to the council for more than a year for help in increasing humanitarian access. Diplomats say that it will be tough however for the council to take further action. Russia supported by China has shielded its ally Syria on the Security Council during the war. They had previously vetoed three resolutions that would have condemned Syria's government and threatened it with possible sanctions. BORDER AREAS A representative of an international NGO that works in Syria and neighboring countries said the U.N. "should complement ongoing operations not undermine them." "That's a concern at the moment that a lack of coordination between the U.N. and organizations already working on the ground means they're sometimes doing more harm than good" he said. "Ban Ki-moon's recent report (on aid access) was strong but frustratingly it barely mentioned the challenges that NGOs have faced in delivering aid cross border and cross line in Syria." The report dated April 16 said U.N. agencies are not directly providing critical humanitarian support to millions of Syrians across borders one of the main demands which the Security Council resolution put to Syrian authorities. On March 20 U.N. aid trucks crossed from Turkey into Syria for the first time. But the report said the operation "allowed virtually no assistance to reach civilians in  areas". It said that delays in sharing U.N. plans meant that aid during the cross-border operation was duplicated as other humanitarian groups were also distributing there. There are eight formal border crossings between Syria and Turkey and the one used Qamishli is the only one where there are government forces in the area. Damascus has made clear it will not allow crossings through rebel-held border posts. "We need the help of the U.N. to really scale up that operation and meet the huge demand for help. There are 7 million people living in areas that can only really be accessed with any ease from border countries" the representative said.

"Ukraine_rebels_free_Swedish_hostage_Obama_seeks_unity_against_Russia",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_23_21_17_GMT",""","Ukraine rebels free Swedish hostage; Obama seeks unity against Russia 1 of 9. Pro-Russian protesters take part in a rally near the seized office of the SBU state security service in Luhansk eastern Ukraine April 27 2014. Mediators held in Ukraine as U.S. readies new Russia sanctions Separatists seize control of TV HQ in east Ukraine city Sun Apr 27 2014 EU courts Moldova with visa-free travel from Monday Sun Apr 27 2014 'Open arms and smile' fail to protect German colonel in Ukraine Sun Apr 27 2014 UK to host international meeting on stolen Ukrainian assets Sun Apr 27 2014 KUALA LUMPUR/SLAVIANSK Ukraine (Reuters) - Pro-Russian rebels paraded European monitors they are holding in eastern Ukraine on Sunday freeing one but saying they had no plans to release another seven as the United States and Europe prepared new sanctions against Moscow. U.S. President Barack Obama called for the United States and Europe to join forces to impose stronger measures to restrain Moscow. The White House said it will add names on Monday of people close to President Vladimir Putin and firms they control to a list of Russians hit by sanctions over Ukraine and also impose new restrictions on high tech exports. The European Union is expected to follow suit by adding to its own list of targeted Russian people and firms but Washington and Brussels have yet to reach agreement on wider measures designed to hurt the Russian economy more broadly. In Donetsk where pro-Russian rebels have proclaimed an independent "people's republic" armed fighters seized the headquarters of regional television and ordered it to start broadcasting a Russian state TV channel. Speaking during a visit to Malaysia Obama said restraining Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions in Ukraine would depend on the United States and its allies finding a unified position on tighter sanctions. "We're going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified and the United States and Europe is unified rather than this is just a U.S.-Russian conflict" Obama told reporters. White House deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the new U.S. measures would be imposed on Monday mostly focused on adding to a list of those barred from travel to the United States and hit by asset freezes. "We will be looking to designate people who are in (Putin's) inner circle who have a significant impact on the Russian economy. We'll be looking to designate companies that they and other inner circle people control" Blinken told CBS television. "We'll be looking at taking steps as well with regard to high-technology exports to their defense industry. All of this together is going to have an impact." The stand-off over Ukraine an ex-Soviet republic of about 45 million people has dragged relations between Russia and the West to their lowest level since the end of the Cold War. After Ukrainians overthrew a pro-Russian president Putin overturned decades of international diplomacy last month by announcing the right to use military force on his neighbor's territory. He has seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and massed tens of thousands of troops on the frontier. Heavily armed pro-Russian gunmen have seized buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Kiev and its Western allies say the uprising is directed by Russian agents. Moscow denies it is involved and says the uprising is a spontaneous reaction to oppression of Russian speakers by Kiev. An international agreement reached this month calls on rebels to vacate occupied buildings but Obama said Russia had not "lifted a finger" to push its allies to comply. "In fact there's strong evidence that they've been encouraging the activities in eastern and southern Ukraine." PRISONERS The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has sent unarmed monitors to try to encourage compliance with the peace deal. The pro-Russian rebels seized eight European monitors three days ago and have been holding them at their most heavily-fortified redoubt in the town of Slaviansk. One a Swede was permitted to leave on Sunday after OSCE negotiators arrived to discuss their release. A separatist spokeswoman said the prisoner had been let go on medical grounds but there were no plans to free the rest. The captives from Germany the Czech Republic Denmark Poland and Sweden were paraded before reporters on Sunday and said they were in good health. "We have no indication when we will be sent home to our countries" the group's leader German Colonel Axel Schneider told reporters as armed men in camouflage fatigues and balaclavas looked on. "We wish from the bottom of our hearts to go back to our nations as soon and as quickly as possible." Germany denounced the appearance and said Moscow must press their captors to free the prisoners. "The public parading of the OSCE observers and Ukrainian security forces as prisoners is revolting and blatantly hurts the dignity of the victims" Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement. "It is an infringement of every rule of behavior and standards that are made for tense situations like this. Russia has a duty to influence the separatists so that the detained members of the OSCE mission are freed as soon as possible." The OSCE a European security body includes Russia. Its main Ukraine mission was approved by Moscow although the Europeans held in Slaviansk were on a separate OSCE-authorized mission that did not require Russia's consent. Vyacheslav Ponomaryov the rebel leader who has declared himself mayor of Slaviansk has described them as prisoners of war and said the separatists were prepared to exchange them for fellow rebels in Ukrainian custody. Washington is more hawkish on further sanctions than some of its European allies which has caused a degree of impatience among some U.S. officials. Many European countries are worried about the risks of imposing tougher sanctions - the EU has more than 10 times as much trade with Russia as the United States and imports about a quarter of its natural gas from Russia. RUSSIA! RUSSIA! At the Donetsk television headquarters about 400 pro-Russian demonstrators chanted "Russia! Russia!" and "Referendum!" - a call for a vote like one in Crimea that preceded its annexation by Russia last month. Four separatists in masks controlled access at the entrance and more masked gunmen in camouflage fatigues could be seen inside. Oleg Dzholos the station's director who came outside to speak to reporters said the people who seized the building had ordered him to change the programming. "They used force to push back the gates" he said. "There were no threats. There were not many of my people. What can a few people do? The leaders of this movement just gave me an ultimatum that one of the Russian channels has to be broadcast." Ponomaryov the rebel leader in Slaviansk said his men had captured three officers with Ukraine's state security service who he said had been mounting an operation against separatists in the nearby town of Horlivka. The Russian television station Rossiya 24 showed footage it said was of a colonel a major and a captain. They were shown seated with their hands behind their backs blindfolded and wearing no trousers. At least two had bruises on their faces. Ukraine's State Security Service said the three had been part of a unit which went to Horlivka to arrest a suspect in the murder of Volodymyr Rybak a pro-Kiev councillor whose body was found last week in a river near Slaviansk.

"Congestion_capital_Brussels_looks_to_unclog_traffic_arteries",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_07_06_58_GMT",""","1 of 5. Cars are seen stuck in a traffic jam on a road near the European Commission headquarters during the morning rush hour in Brussels March 20 2014. BRUSSELS (Reuters) - For two years running Brussels has been named the most congested city in North America and western Europe a mark of shame for the capital that guides Europe's environment and transport policies. The disgrace has however had the effect of uniting Belgium's environmentalist Green Party center-right rivals N-VA and business and motoring groups in a call for a solution whose time may finally have come - charging drivers for distance traveled. Tests have already begun. Others are watching keenly to see what will work in a city the size of Brussels whose issues are different from sprawling megacities like Bangkok or Beijing or London with its central congestion charge. "Since London brought in their congestion scheme technology has come a long way" said Nina Renshaw deputy director of sustainable transport campaign group Transport & Environment. "Today it's possible using GPS (global positioning systems) to have precise billing per kilometer which wasn't possible even 10 years ago" she said. "That makes it much more attractive for cities to consider it." Cities in the Netherlands and Sweden are among those who want to reduce congestion but also cut carbon emissions an effort in which Europe sees itself as setting an example. The European Commission estimates traffic congestion costs at nearly 100 billion euros per year or 1 percent of the European Union's gross domestic product not including the health costs of pollution. The latter has led to the rise of low emission zones in cities from Umea in northern Sweden to Naples in southern Italy. Air pollution from traffic prompted Paris to ban cars with even number plates from entering the city for a day in March. Bruno De Lille Green Party member and mobility secretary for the Brussels region is skeptical his city really is the developed world's capital of congestion as traffic services provider INRIX says but acknowledges his city has some unique problems. One is Belgium's high population density ranked 10th in the world excluding small island or city states such as Malta or Singapore. It also has a tax system that encourages company cars and compensates the cost of driving to work with the former taxed at a lower rate than salaries and the latter able partially to be offset against tax. Moreover more than half of the 650000 people employed in Brussels live outside city limits. Around half of those commute into the city by car a higher proportion than in most European cities. Eurostat data shows the same figure in Amsterdam is 40 percent for example. In Washington DC the percentage is also around 40 percent and for Chicago it is 50 percent according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So far Brussels has tried to fight traffic creep by making public transport more attractive with special bus or tram lanes. That has worked by convincing many commuters to switch to public transport or bicycles but has also created its own problems. "What we've seen in the last 10 years is that we've got 7 percent fewer cars on the roads but the jams have got longer. That's because there's less room for cars" De Lille said. On weekday mornings there are a combined 150-200 km (93-124 miles) of jams on 7000 km of Belgian highways on average according to motorist association Touring. The record set on one day in March last year was 1400 km of jams. THE SOLUTION The most common way of tackling traffic congestion and the pollution it causes has been a congestion zone such as those in place in London Stockholm and Milan. London's 10-pound charge has reduced car traffic by 27 percent since its introduction in 2003. Milan dropped off the top of the INRIX congestion standings after it introduced a charge in 2012. Brussels is considering a combination of steps including a rapid regional rail system along the lines of Paris's RER. "But if we want the cars to move more freely then we have to take another step" De Lille said. The proposal to charge drivers per kilometer traveled is already on trial with around 1000 volunteers in the city and neighboring regions of Flanders and Wallonia. In the trial the volunteers' driving patterns and distances are measured. If they subsequently drive less they are rewarded with cash while activity over the norm is noted. In real life people would be charged electronically or via ticketing for driving during peak hours. The idea is backed by the Flemish separatist party N-VA currently the largest party in parliament albeit balanced against reductions of annual road tax as well as business bodies the Belgian auto federation Febiac and Touring. First public responses have been negative: an online petition opposing the scheme quickly gained over 170000 signatories. In the past decade plans for congestion charges in Manchester and Edinburgh were rejected in referendums. But Transport & Environment says public opinion can shift sharply once road pricing is set up. In Stockholm for example a poll showed very strong support for its congestion charge a year after its launch. Transport & Environment also says that a kilometer charge is a more effective way to cut congestion and emissions than a congestion charge which some users simply get used to. "We prefer the kilometer charges because if you pay a one-off fee you're incentivized to maximize your driving within that period" said Transport & Environment's Renshaw. Jeroen Verhoeven of Bral a group seeking to make Brussels more livable believes a combination of congestion zone and distance charge would be best. With just the former there is no discouragement to drive after taking the one-off hit. With just the latter drivers may still be inclined to make short trips in the city. Joost Kaesemans of Febiac who says he regularly cycles to work says the time lost to traffic jams has doubled in Belgium since 2007. In a report with PwC last year Febiac said cutting traffic by just 5-10 percent could reduce congestion by 40 percent. "Road pricing is a system you can influence yourself. We estimate that 20 percent of the peak-time traffic doesn't have to be there at that time" he said. "Is it for tomorrow? It could take until after 2020 ... but doing nothing is not an option."

"Malaysia_cites_sensitivities_as_Obama_struggles_to_push_trade_pact",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_09_59_13_GMT",""","Malaysia cites 'sensitivities' as Obama struggles to push trade pact U.S. President Barack Obama listens to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak as they participate in a joint news conference at the Perdana Putra Building in Putrajaya April 27 2014. KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Sunday that he and U.S. President Barack Obama had agreed to upgrade bilateral relations but suggested that his country remains far from ready to sign a U.S-led trade pact due to domestic "sensitivities." Obama's visit to Malaysia follows his swing through Japan where he failed to clinch a trade deal key to the U.S. "rebalancing" back to Asia. Such a deal would have injected momentum into the delayed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. Najib's ambition to bring Malaysia into Obama's flagship trade plan has been undercut by the resurgent influence of traditionalists within his own ruling party following a weak election showing last year. Early this month a Malaysian cabinet minister was reported as saying the country was a long way from being able to sign a TPP deal and that the priority should be on economic integration within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc. Najib said Malaysia was committed to free trade and denied that Washington was "bullying" the Southeast Asian nation into joining the controversial pact. "We are working around the sensitivities and challenges which I alluded to in my discussions with President Obama" Najib told a joint news conference with the U.S. leader in the administrative capital of Putrajaya. "He fully understands our domestic sensitivities and we will sit down and try to iron this out with the intention of trying to work out a deal in the near future." Obama said that domestic opposition to trade deals wasn't surprising and that the United States was willing to be flexible on particularly sensitive areas such as prices of life-saving medicines that critics say will jump in countries like Malaysia under the TPP. "There's never been a trade deal in which somebody's not going to at some point object because they're fearful of the future or they're invested in the status quo" Obama said. Protesters briefly disrupted Obama's talk later in the day at a town hall-style meeting with young Malaysians at a university holding up anti-TPP signs before being ushered away by security. "PEACEFUL RISE" FOR CHINA The challenge for Obama during his week-long four-nation regional tour is to convince Asian partners that Washington is serious about its promised strategic "pivot" to increase U.S. influence in Asia without harming U.S. ties with China the world's second-biggest economy and a growing maritime power. In his town hall speech the Hawaiian-born president who lived in Indonesia as a boy told his audience that the United States has long had connections across the Pacific as well as the Atlantic. He told students he plans to meet every year with the leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and would work through the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) to build trade ties. "We want to work with old allies and worthy partners and with China" he said. "We want to see a peaceful rise to China." Najib announced that he had agreed with Obama to upgrade the two countries' ties to a "comprehensive partnership" mirroring a step that Malaysia took with China last year when President Xi Jinping made a state visit. "This marks a new phase in our relationship with greater collaboration in economy security education science technology and more" Najib said. Human rights groups and members of Malaysia's opposition alliance have urged Obama to speak out on what they say has been a sharp deterioration in religious and political freedoms since the ruling coalition suffered its election setback last May. Since then the government has reinstated detention without trial as part of a package of tougher crime laws and renewed what critics call a campaign of judicial persecution against opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. In March a court convicted Anwar on a charge of sodomy and sentenced him to five years in prison. The verdict came days before he was to stand in an election seen as paving the way for him to take charge of Malaysia's richest state. Asked why he would not be meeting Anwar on his three-day visit to Malaysia Obama said it was "not indicative of a lack of concern" and that Malaysia had "work to do" on allowing more freedoms. Obama was due to meet civil society leaders later on Sunday. Najib said he was committed to the rule of law and civil liberties but that he had to take account complex racial sensitivities in the multi-ethnic nation of 29 million people where majority ethnic Malays enjoy special rights. "We have to manage that and that's exactly what Malaysia has done and because of that we are a relatively peaceful harmonious nation" Najib said.

"Abbas_calls_Holocaust_most_heinous_crime_against_humanity",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_11_31_30_GMT",""","Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attends a meeting with the Palestinian Liberation Organization's (PLO) central council in the West Bank City of Ramallah April 26 2014. JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the Nazi Holocaust "the most heinous crime" against humanity in modern times in an apparent bid to build bridges with Israel days after troubled peace talks collapsed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the overture on Sunday saying Abbas's Palestinian power-sharing deal with Hamas which led Israel to suspend the negotiations on Thursday put him in partnership with an Islamist group that denies the Holocaust and seeks the Jewish state's destruction. "What I say to him very simply is this: President Abbas tear up your pact with Hamas" Netanyahu said on the CBS news program Face the Nation. Abbas's message published in Arabic and English by the official Palestinian news agency WAFA coincided with Israel's annual remembrance day for the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and included an expression of sympathy for the families of the victims. "What happened to the Jews in the Holocaust is the most heinous crime to have occurred against humanity in the modern era" WAFA quoted Abbas as saying at a meeting a week ago with an American rabbi. By speaking in superlative terms Abbas could risk a backlash from Palestinians who draw comparisons between their suffering at the hands of Israeli occupiers and that of Jews under Hitler's Third Reich. Abbas has condemned the mass killings of Jews in World War Two before and challenged allegations stemming from a 1983 book he authored that he is a Holocaust denier. But the timing of the publication of his latest comments gave them extra significance a day after he signaled he remained committed to the peace talks and said a future Palestinian unity government would recognize Israel. "SHOCKED" On CBS Netanyahu said he and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry "were both shocked" to learn last Wednesday of the reconciliation agreement between Hamas and Abbas's Palestine Liberation Organization. The peace negotiations championed by Kerry were facing an April 29 deadline with little public sign the two sides were making progress toward a U.S.-mediated deal to extend the talks. Netanyahu said in the TV interview however that he had negotiated in earnest for nine months working closely with Kerry and "we made some significant progress". Palestinian officials have blamed Netanyahu for the peace impasse noting he failed to carry out a pledged release of Palestinian prisoners and citing Israeli announcements of further construction in settlements in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu has said Abbas's refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state blocked progress in talks aimed at ending decades of conflict and creating a Palestinian state. The Palestinian unity accord followed seven years of failed reconciliation attempts after Hamas seized the Gaza Strip from forces loyal to Abbas in 2007. The agreement envisages the formation of a Palestinian government of non-political "technocrats" within five months and new elections six months later. On CBS Netanyahu said Abbas "cannot embrace Hamas and say that he wants peace with Israel". In a separate interview with CNN Netanyahu reiterated he would never negotiate with a Palestinian government backed by Hamas a group that both Israel and the United States regard as a terrorist organization. Hamas officials were not immediately available to comment on Netanyahu's Holocaust-denial accusations. But in an open letter to a senior U.N. official in 2009 Hamas branded the Holocaust "a lie invented by the Zionists". Hamas was protesting U.N. plans at the time to start Holocaust studies for children in Gaza. Yad Vashem Israel's national Holocaust memorial gave a guarded welcome to Abbas's statement on Sunday. "Holocaust denial and revisionism are sadly prevalent in the Arab world including among Palestinians" Yad Vashem said. "Thus the statement that the Holocaust is the most heinous crime to have occurred against humanity in the modern era coming from Abbas might signal a change."

"Germans_outraged_by_Berlusconi_s_comments_on_concentration_camps",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_14_14_49_GMT",""","Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gestures as he appears as a guest on the RAI television show Porta a Porta (Door to Door) in Rome April 24 2014. BERLIN (Reuters) - German politicians on Sunday condemned as "unacceptable" and "absurd" comments by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi that Germans denied the existence of Nazi concentration camps. Social Democrat (SPD) General Secretary Yasmin Fahimi described the comments as "repugnant shocking and completely unacceptable". "These lapses ... not only damage the image of Italy but also endanger the political culture and values of Europe" she told Reuters. She demanded that conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel respond. Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) are allies of Berlusconi's Forza Italia in the European parliament's European Peoples Party conservative grouping. CDU General-Secretary Peter Tauber said the comments were "so absurd that they don't deserve commenting on". Berlusconi said on Saturday: "According to the Germans there never were concentration camps." He caused a storm in 2003 by jokingly offering German Social Democrat Martin Schulz a film part as a concentration camp "kapo" or inmate appointed as an overseer. Social Democrat Schulz told Der Spiegel magazine on Sunday it was also shocking that an Italian sister party of the CDU was campaigning for May's European elections with anti-German slogans such as "More Italy Less Germany". "Such a slogan is outrageous" he said. German conservative Herbert Reul also criticized the slogan saying it was "out of order" and he could not understand it. Anti-German rhetoric has been on the rise in Italy and other heavily indebted euro states since the euro zone crisis led to German demands for economic austerity.

"New_group_CubaNow_tells_Obama_it_s_time_to_change_Cuba_policy",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_17_59_02_GMT",""","New group #CubaNow tells Obama it's time to change Cuba policy U.S. President Barack Obama speaks at the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative Town Hall at University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur April 27 2014. MIAMI (Reuters) - A new advocacy group calling for the United States to change its policy toward Cuba launched an advertising campaign on Monday with posters on the Washington D.C. metro system showing President Barack Obama and urging him to "stop waiting." The metro ads by the group #CubaNow are designed to highlight economic changes happening in Cuba. The group believes the 52-year-old U.S. embargo against the communist-ruled island has not worked. "It's time to bring the conversation on U.S.-Cuba policy into the 21st century" said #CubaNow director Ric Herrero. The group said its mission unlike other Cuba policy groups was specifically focused on changing U.S. thinking about Cuba policy. While the group opposes the embargo it recognized that overturning it in Congress is an uphill battle and other ways can be found to change policy such as allowing all Americans to travel to Cuba. "There's plenty the President can do within his existing authority" said #CubaNow founding member Andres Daz a Cuban-born former Obama administration official at the Department of Commerce. #CubaNow was founded by a group of mostly younger generation Cuban Americans. Herrero declined to discuss its funding. The group's launch coincides with the fifth anniversary of Obama's 2009 steps allowing Cuban-Americans to travel freely to visit relatives in Cuba as well as send remittances. That policy shift helped "usher in more change in that time than had been seen in the previous 50 years" the group said in a press release. Herrero said the group based in Miami and Washington wants the White House to take "new steps" to encourage Cuba's burgeoning private sector which has emerged under economic reforms being slowly introduced by the Cuban government. The group's founding is part of a new wave of efforts to prod Obama into taking bolder steps to engage the Cuban government. It follows a February poll by the Atlantic Council which found a majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba. In November Obama told a Miami area fundraiser that it may be time for the United States to "update" its policies toward Cuba. "Blue jeans and rockn roll brought down the Berlin Wall so we have to recognize that there is a new wave of energy pushing a new approach toward U.S.-Cuba policy" said Alex Castellanos a Republican political strategist who is Cuban American.

"Ukraine_blames_Moscow_for_human_shield_detentions_in_east",""Sat_26_Apr_2014_23_22_28_GMT",""","1 of 17. An armored personnel carrier is seen near a barricade around the state security service building in Slaviansk April 26 2014. Mediators held in Ukraine as U.S. readies new Russia sanctions Russia offered support in effort to free OSCE monitors: Germany Sat Apr 26 2014 Lavrov tells Kerry U.S. should press Kiev to rein in army Sat Apr 26 2014 SLAVIANSK Ukraine (Reuters) - Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine offered on Saturday to release eight captive international observers in a prisoner exchange as Western governments prepared new sanctions against Moscow. The pro-Western government in Kiev blamed Russia for what it called the kidnapping on Friday of the monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The separatists said they suspected the observers of spying; Ukraine said they were being used as human shields. Since Ukrainians toppled their pro-Russian president in February Russia has annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and massed tens of thousands of troops on the country's eastern border. NATO has responded by sending reinforcements to eastern Europe in the gravest East-West crisis since the Cold War. Earlier on Saturday the Group of Seven major economies announced they had agreed to impose more sanctions on Russia which they believe is bent on destabilizing its former Soviet neighbor and possibly grabbing more territory. Diplomats said the United States and the European Union were expected to unveil new punitive action against Russian individuals from Monday. Russia denies orchestrating a campaign by pro-Moscow militants who have seized control of public buildings across eastern Ukraine. It accuses the Kiev government of whipping up tensions by sending troops to root out the separatists. The OSCE sent more monitors on Saturday to seek the release of those detained in Slaviansk a city under the separatists' control. Those being held are from Germany Sweden Denmark Poland and the Czech Republic. "COINS TO EXCHANGE" Vyacheslav Ponomaryov de facto mayor of Slaviansk told reporters: "They were soldiers on our territory without our permission of course they are prisoners." He said the separatists were ready to exchange the captured monitors for fellow rebels now in the custody of the Ukrainian authorities. "Prisoners have always been coins to exchange during times of war. It's an international practice" he said. Ukraine's state security service said the OSCE observers - part of a German-led military verification mission deployed since early March at Kiev's request - were being held "in inhuman conditions" and that one needed medical help. A spokeswoman for the Vienna-based organisation of which Russia is a member said the OSCE had been in contact with "all sides" since late on Friday but had had no direct contact with the observers. The Russian foreign ministry said it was working to resolve the crisis but blamed Kiev for failing to ensure the OSCE mission's safety in "areas where the authorities do not control the situation and where a military operation against residents of their own country has been unleashed". Russia's Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper released a video interview with a man it identified as Ivan Strelkov a militia leader in Slaviansk accused by Ukraine's security services of being an employee of Russian intelligence. He suggested the monitors might have been using their diplomatic status "to carry out reconnaissance of the resistance positions for the benefit of the Ukrainian army". It is standard practice for serving military officers to be seconded to OSCE missions. DIPLOMATIC MOVES German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier discussed the Ukraine situation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov by telephone on Saturday "with an accent on possible steps to de-escalate the situation" the Russian ministry said. Steinmeier said Lavrov had offered his backing which he welcomed. In a separate call with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry the Russian minister said Ukraine must halt military operations in the southeast of the country in order to defuse the crisis. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said Russian military aircraft entered Ukrainian airspace seven times overnight. "The only reason is to provoke Ukraine ... and to accuse Ukraine of waging war against Russia" the prime minister told reporters before cutting short a visit to Rome. Washington deployed 150 paratroopers to Lithuania on Saturday. A total of 600 U.S. troops have now arrived in Poland and the former Soviet Baltic states in a bid to reassure nervous NATO allies. "As threats emerged we see who our real friends are" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said as she greeted the troops at the Siauliai air base. Without mentioning Russia she said the presence of U.S. troops would "repel those who encroach on stability in Europe and peace in the region". "The numbers are not important. If just one of our guests is harmed this would mean an open confrontation not with Lithuania but with the United States of America." "DOOR REMAINS OPEN" U.S. officials said new sanctions targeting "cronies" of President Vladimir Putin could be unveiled as early as Monday unless Russia moved fast to defuse the crisis. In a joint statement G7 leaders said Russia had not taken any concrete steps to implement an accord signed earlier this month in Geneva intended to rein in illegal armed groups. "Instead it has continued to escalate tensions by increasingly concerning rhetoric and ongoing threatening military maneuvers on Ukraine's border" it said. "We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia." But it added: "We underscore that the door remains open to a diplomatic resolution of this crisis." Senior EU diplomats will meet on Monday to discuss the next steps and are expected to add 15 more names to a list of Russians subject to asset freezes and a travel ban. Putin acknowledged for the first time this week that sanctions were causing difficulties for Russia though he said the impact was not "critical". Standard & Poor's cut Russia's sovereign long-term debt rating on Friday making it more expensive for the government to borrow money. That forced the central bank to raise its key interest rate to limit a fall in the rouble. Russian banks have been moving funds out of foreign accounts in anticipation of sanctions. Russia has threatened to cut off gas to Ukraine which would have a knock-on effect on customers further west because many pipelines transit the country. Slovakia said on Saturday it had reached an agreement with Ukraine on opening up limited reverse flow of natural gas from central Europe to Ukraine.

"Putin_foe_Navalny_avoids_detention_during_new_Russian_trial",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_15_51_31_GMT",""","Opposition leader Alexei Navalny talks to the media after leaving a justice court building in Moscow April 22 2014. MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court rejected a request by prosecutors to put Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny behind bars during a second trial on theft charges leaving one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics under house arrest. Navalny who is serving a five-year suspended sentence on a theft conviction he says was Putin's revenge for his opposition could be jailed for years if found guilty of stealing more than 30 million roubles ($840200) from two companies through fraud. But the judge's decision to prolong his house arrest instead of moving him to a detention facility as prosecutors and prison authorities had requested suggests the Kremlin is concerned that jailing him could cause protests. After gaining prominence with an on-line crusade against the corruption that he says permeates Putin's government Navalny emerged from a wave of street protests in 2011-2012 as Russia's most popular opposition leader. The initial theft conviction prevents Navalny 37 from running for office for years. He startled the Kremlin with a strong second-place showing in a Moscow mayoral election last year. Putin weathered the protests to win a third presidential term in 2012 and critics say the legal pressure on Navalny is part of a intensified clampdown on dissent since his return to the Kremlin. Putin denies he interferes in court cases. (Writing by Steve Gutterman; Editing by Angus MacSwan) We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion anecdotes links and data.

"Berlusconi_says_surreal_to_suggest_he_is_anti-German",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_16_00_03_GMT",""","Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gestures as he appears as a guest on the RAI television show Porta a Porta (Door to Door) in Rome April 24 2014. ROME (Reuters) - Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi denied on Monday that he was anti-German after he caused outrage at the weekend by suggesting Germany did not acknowledge the existence of Nazi concentration camps. The politician said his leftwing opponents had taken out of context a comment he had made about Martin Schulz a German who is president of the European Parliament and the center left's candidate to be the next European Commission chief. "It's surreal to attribute to me any anti-German sentiment or a presumed hostility towards the German people with whom I am friends" Berlusconi said in a statement. At a campaign rally on Saturday Berlusconi described Schulz whom he once compared to a concentration camp overseer as unfriendly to Italy. He then added: "According to the Germans there never were concentration camps. The latest in a long line of off-color quips from the 77-year-old billionaire has fed into the European parliamentary election campaign in which Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia party has adopted a marked anti-German tone. Trailing both Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's center-left Democratic Party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement in the polls ahead of the next month's election the party has blamed German Chancellor Angela Merkel for forcing Italy to adopt harsh austerity measures. One of its campaign slogan says: "More Italy less Germany". "If I'm hostile to anything it's to counter-productive austerity to certain restrictions and rules which in my opinion are seriously mistaken and which are trapping the whole of Europe in a long economic stagnation" Berlusconi's statement said. Jean-Claude Juncker the candidate for European Commission chief put forward by the European People's Party the center-right group that includes Forza Italia called on Berlusconi to withdraw his remarks about concentration camps saying he was "disgusted" by them.
