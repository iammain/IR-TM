Sanctions against Cuba were introduced in 1960 in response to the expropriation of Americans properties Russian FM: Crisis in Ukraine was caused by coup supported by West HAVANA April 29. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow believes that the maintenance of embargo against Cuba is totally unacceptable Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said after a meeting with his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez. We think the maintenance of the embargo against Cuba contrary to the will of a vast majority of UN member-states is absolutely unacceptable he said. Sanctions against Cuba were introduced in 1960 in response to the expropriation of Americans properties. They were expanded later on up to a virtually full commercial and economic blockade of the island. UN member-states have more than once spoken in favor of lifting the US blockade of Cuba. One of the documents towards that goal a 2011 resolution on the importance of terminating the economic commercial and financial blockade imposed by the US on Cuba received the support of 186 delegations at the UN. Bruno Rodriguez said in October 2013 while taking the floor at the UN that the damage done to Cuba during half a century of sanctions had inflicted a damage of $ 1.126 trillion. Since the start of Barack Obamas presidency Cubas blockade has only intensified.

Kievs plans to carry out a special assault operation in the South-East of Ukraine will lead to a catastrophe the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday May 1. Moscow is seriously worried by media reports about the Kiev regimes plans to carry out a special assault operation in the south-eastern regions of the country using ultra-nationalist Right Sector units the ministry said. Such irresponsible and aggressive actions by the present Ukrainian government can have catastrophic consequences if implemented the ministry warned. Punitive measures against their own people would indicate the inability of the Kiev leadership to fulfill its obligations assumed under the Geneva Statement of April 17 to stop all violence as soon as possible and launch a broad national dialogue with all regions and political forces. The ministry urged Kiev and the conniving United States and the European Union which signed the Geneva agreement not to make criminal mistakes and to soberly assess the gravity of possible consequences for the use of force against the Ukrainian people. Dozens of people hold picket near building of Cabinet of Ministers in Kiev 'Kievs intention to hold a nationwide poll May 25 a sham' Kievs intention to hold a nationwide poll on May 25 is a sham the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

He also said that the Ukrainian Cabinet had approved its vision of the regional reform. It is separately stated that the countrys government is ready to give additional guarantees on the corresponding territory to Russian-speaking population and other national minorities. However what kind of additional guarantees is meant was not specified. Instead of launching an extensive nationwide discussion in the country to seek for ways out of the deep political and socio-economic crisis that would involve all political forces and all regions the Kiev authorities are engaged in staging sham actions the Russian Foreign Ministry stressed.

Putin: Sanctions may benefit Russian economy but MasterCard Visa made mistake "By acting the way they are acting in Russia they are undermining trust in themselves and therefore will certainly lose the market" the Russian president added ST. PETERSBURG April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. Economic sanctions may benefit Russia by helping de-offshorize its economy and create better conditions for doing business inside the country President Vladimir Putin said. Many people who take their savings and business to low-tax areas are already thinking whether it would be better to carry out all of their economic activities including registration at home the president said at the Media Forum on Thursday April 24. As for de-offshorization the Russian authorities are facing many important and necessary tasks to create better conditions for doing business inside the country he said. This means the tax system its stability rates the fight against excessive bureaucratization and corruption and many other things. Putin believes that sanctions will also prod the Russian authorities into working harder and taking measures to strengthen the sovereignty of the national economy by creating a national payment system or drafting a law on enhanced sovereignty in strategic industries. The world is globalizing and the economy and politics are closely interdependent but excessive dependence leads to the loss of sovereignty Putin said with regret and cited the countrys gold and currency reserves as an example. Some countries with large gold and currency reserves diversify them one way or another he added. We did not create our own settlement system as Japan or China did and this makes us completely dependent on our partners the president said. We have always believed that our partners both Visa and MasterCard are depoliticized economic entities and companies. However as it turned out they too are under strong political pressure and influence and give in to it right away he said. Operators of international payment systems must be brought to senses - Medvedev Experts: Russia needs 2-3 years to create national payment system Creation of Russia nationwide payment system to take 2-6 months Sberbank chief Putin intends to open account in US sanctioned bank Rossiya Putin to get salary through bank Rossiya that fell under US sanctions From the economic point of view this is a big mistake because MasterCard and Visa control 90% of the Russian market which we gave to them of our own free will and all payments inside the country go through these systems and to a large extent through serves located in the United States. But thats nonsense! Why did Japan do it and can use a national payment system now but we are using their [American] systems inside the country I am not saying abroad where you go on a business trip or vacation Putin said This is a very big business for these companies. By acting the way they are acting in Russia they are undermining trust in themselves and therefore will certainly lose the market he said. At the same time he noted that the Russian authorities were not planning any retaliatory sanctions against MasterCard or Visa. However not only have we thought about it but we have also started creating our own national payment system Putin said. Putin said in March that Russia would create its own payment system. These systems work successfully in such countries as Japan and China. They started off as national systems for domestic needs only but are now becoming increasingly popular he said. The Japanese system now operates in 200 countries. Why shouldnt we do the same? We should and we will Putin said at a meeting with the leadership of the Federation Council the upper house of parliament. The Central Bank of Russia is already making plans for creating a national payment system in the country. We should create a system that will ensure uninterrupted domestic payments that make up about 90 percent of the total. We are preparing measures that should be realistic easy and gradual. At the initial stage we should ensure technological compatibility between processing and operating centers of major banks so that they could switch over quickly Central Bank Chair Elvira Nabiullina said. A draft law ensuring uninterrupted money transfers within Russia will go to the State Duma lower house of parliament shortly. It bans all participants from terminating transfers unilaterally. Clearing centers will not be allowed to provide information about money transfers outside the country or make such information accessible from other countries. In 2011 several MPs called for creating a domestic processing centre. The relevant law was adopted but processing operations were not transferred to Russia despite the risk of losing access to international payment systems for Russian banks. This is precisely what happened on March 21 2014 when Visa and MasterCard both headquartered in the United States suspended operations for several Russian banks. The blocking of access to the SWIFT inter-bank payment system makes online payments in any currency except the national one impossible. Presidential adviser Sergei Glazyev suggests creating a single processing centre for payments within the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Customs Union created by Belarus Kazakhstan and Russia.

Pavel Gubarev is not the only political prisoner of the Kiev regime.

New sanctions against Russia can upset crisis resolution in Ukraine -official LUGANO April 26/ITAR-TASS/. New sanctions the United States and the European Union are threatening to impose on Russia on April 28 is the way in the opposite direction which will only upset the crisis resolution in Ukraine Yuri Vorobyov Deputy Chair of the Federation Council (upper house of parliament) said on Saturday April 26. New sanctions by the EU and the US are the way leading in the opposite direction. We have seen this before. On February 21 the decision was adopted with Poland Germany and France acting as guarantors and a protocol was signed. But it was never implemented. Then Russia the U.S. the EU and Ukraine met in Geneva and made decisions but no one is going to implement them he said. Vorobyov who is in Switzerland on a visit as co-chair of the Switzerland-Russia inter-parliamentary friendship group believes that Kiev bears prime responsibility for this. The agreement must be implemented by Ukraine a country where all these events are taking place. But all sanctions are directed against Russia which is not clear at all he added. Any sanctions will only complicate the settlement process and can do no good. Its a road to nowhere Vorobyov said. I dont think this is a logical way and I see no logic in such decisions they are counterproductive. At their meeting in Brussels on April 28 the ambassadors of the 28 European Union countries are planning to enlarge the black list for Russia. Earlier a U.S. administration official said that Washington might impose additional sanctions on Russia on the same day and that they would be coordinated with Europe but not necessarily identical.

Lawmakers still unable to agree on memorandum on settlement in eastern Ukraine KIEV April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine's parliament will make a new attempt on Thursday to coordinate the memorandum on settling the situation in the east of the country along with the bill to amnesty participants in the protests that swept across the eastern regions. Though the documents are not formally on the Thursday agenda lawmakers said they would be added as soon as a consensus was reached between the opposition /the Party of Regions and the Communists/ and the coalition comprising the Batkivshchina UDAR and Svoboda factions and two groups of lawmakers. On Wednesday the heads of the factions failed to reach an accord on the bill on amnesty for protesters in the east of the country. At present six alternative documents are offered for review in parliament. The cabinet submitted its own bill on inadmissibility of prosecution for the events during mass actions of civil confrontation that began on February 22 2014. The Party of Regions in the bill of its own called for amnestying all those who had captured administrative buildings in eastern regions as the new authorities had amnestied the protesters on Kiev's Independence Square. However the coalition which called the Maidan supporters "patriots" denounced protesters in the east as "separatists." It said it would object to exempting from punishment all the participants in the protests in the Donetsk Lugansk and Kharkov regions. Nor can the parliamentary factions come to terms on the memorandum on settling the situation in the east. Acting head of Batkivshchina Sergei Sobolev said that the Party of Regions and the Communists had snubbed with the document drawn by the coalition. "At present there is actually no support from the Party of Regions or the Communists for the draft of the memorandum of mutual understanding brought forward by speaker of Verkhovnaya Rada /parliament/ and the heads of the factions of the parliamentary majority" Sobolev said. Speaker Alexander Turchinov's document contains several provisions which the opposition flatly rejects. The document does not envision federalization broader powers for regions official status for other languages in certain regions and amendments to the Constitution. Last week the coalition tried to put Turchinov's document on the agenda but it failed short of the required 226 votes. Lawmakers came close to "the format of passing the memorandum" but had not reached a consensus yet the speaker said in comments on the situation. The Party of Regions drew its own version of the memorandum. Together with the Communists it calls for "fixing in the Constitution the status of Russian as the second state language." They also offered to immediately adopt the laws on reform of local self rule and regional governance. Specifically the document proposes replacing regional and district state administrations with executive committees of regional and district councils and delegating executive powers to them. The Party of regions also insists on direct elections of chairpersons of regional councils by regional communities in an open vote by residents and on providing necessary funding to regions through the establishment of fair distribution of budget revenue. Local authorities in the east of the country support these demands. For example deputies of the Kharkov Town Council asked Ukrainian lawmakers to pass a law on local referenda to realize people's right to the expression of will. "We the legitimately elected representatives of Kharkov support Kharkov residents' rights to the expression of their views and peaceful actions" the deputies said in a statement. They also said they were at one with regional residents' position voiced during an opinion pool in Kharkov in 2002 on using Russian together with the state language in all spheres of public life. Kharkov Town Council also asked the parliament to "take measures aimed at restoring citizens' constitutional rights to information and ensure the resumption of broadcasting of Russian television channels." Kiev-appointed chairman of the Donetsk region state administration /OGA/ Sergei Taruta called for all-Ukrainian referendum on the status of the Russian language and decentralisation of Ukraine. "People want the referendum and should be given the opportunity to hold it. I suggest setting the date for May 25 the day of Ukrainian presidential election" Taruta said. He believes it is necessary to begin to formulate questions for the referendum as soon as possible in order to secure accord between all the interested parties. His initiative was supported by mayors district councils and state administrations of the Donetsk region.

Lavrov calls for end to army operation against protesters in Ukraine MOSCOW April 26./ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday April 26 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an end to the army operation against protesters in southeastern Ukraine and for stopping aggressive actions of ultranationalists from the Right Sector. Lavrov also urged Kerry to use his influence for getting arrested protest leaders released. He [Lavrov] once again highlighted the issue of political prisoners and urged the United States to use its influence in order to get detained protest leaders in the South-East of Ukraine released. The secretarys attention was drawn to the proposals put forth by the Party of Regions and public movements in the South-East regarding the start of a nationwide dialogue and constitutional reform the Foreign Ministry said. Kerry assured Lavrov that Washington would seek to use its possibilities to prod the Kiev authorities into taking concrete steps to ease tensions and expressed hope that south-eastern regions would reciprocate. Lavrov and Kerry also discussed the steps being taken to settle the incident with the detention of European military observers who have arrived in Ukraine at Kievs invitation under the Vienna Document of 2011 on confidence- and security-building measures. They travelled to the South-East without properly notifying the public bodies that are controlling the situation in the region. On Friday April 25 supporters of federalisation detained a bus with passengers with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities. The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures. Yevgeny Gorbik a spokesperson for the supporters of federalisation told reporters that the detained military observers had been engaged in intelligence activities. The humanitarian group of the [OSCE] mission has denied any relation to them They [observers] had intelligence agents cryptograms and notebooks with secret notes Gorbik said. A Bulgarian officer had a notebook with notes in Russian which confirm his intelligence activities and speak of a meeting with agents he added. No charges have been brought against them so far. But theyve ended up in a company that calls into question the legitimacy of their activities Gorbik said adding The investigation is underway to find out what they were doing and where.

Kiev does nothing to implement Geneva agreements - Russia's ambassador to UN Our Western colleagues first of all American who have an unprecedented influence on the current Kiev (authorities) have either failed or did not want to persuade Kiev to fulfil its obligations he says Sending OSCE observers to southeast of Ukraine by Kiev might be a provocation Churkin UNITED NATIONS April 30. /ITAR-TASS/. The authorities in Kiev have done nothing for the implementation of the agreements on the settlement of the crisis in Ukraine that were reached at a four-sided meeting in Geneva on April 17 Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said at a meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday. Nothing has been done by the authorities in Kiev for the implementation of the Geneva document he stressed. Our Western colleagues first of all American who have an unprecedented influence on the current Kiev (authorities) have either failed or did not want to persuade Kiev to fulfil its obligations under the Geneva declaration. They should clearly understand the measure of their responsibility if the situation in Ukraine continues to aggravate he said. The diplomat recalled that at the meeting in Geneva with the participation of Russia Ukraine the United States and European Union the parties reached an agreement on zero tolerance to extremists and on their disarmament. Neither the Right Sector that is marching under Nazi banners nor other radical organisations are laying down arms the diplomat said. On the contrary they have begun to legalise these groups forming from them the Dnepr Slobozhanshchina and Donbass paramilitary battalions he said. According to Churkin in violation of the Geneva agreements Independence Square in the centre of Kiev where concrete obstacles are installed and buildings in the city are still occupied. Nobody is vacating anything in Kiev and Washington officials state complacently that the buildings are legally rented the Russian ambassador said. He added that repression of people who disagree with the new authorities continues in Ukraine and also there is no promised amnesty for the protesters - peoples governor of Donetsk Pavel Gubarev who called for a referendum on the issue of the countrys federalisation is still in prison. The OSCE observers have confirmed that he was tortured and now he is on an indefinite hunger strike the Russian ambassador to the UN said. Churkin sharply criticised diplomats of other countries who spoke at the meeting including the US and British who stated that Kiev was fully complying with its obligations under the Geneva agreement. However in the view of US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power Russia is doing nothing to influence the separatists in the southeast of Ukraine. How can the peoples militia fighters in the east of the country be persuaded to lay down arms if they have been encircled as in Slavyansk by units of the Ukrainian armed forces and the so-called national guard detachments that are completely manned by gunmen of the Right Sector? Churkin asked the colleagues. According to him claims to Russia that it is building up its military presence on the Ukrainian borders are also groundless. Our armed forces are in the Russian territory and the American military so to speak are in a wandering mood. They appear now in Australia then in Lithuania or Poland or an American naval ship stays in the Black Sea longer than is permitted by international law. Yes our military periodically conduct manoeuvres acting transparently and complying with all the existing international agreements. We have no aggressive plans regarding Ukraine the Russian ambassador stressed. He warned that the Kiev regime encouraged by the Western friends is persistently pushing the country towards a catastrophe. According to the diplomat just several days after the meeting there was the resumption of the so-called antiterrorist and in essence - punitive operation. Some 15000 troops tanks armoured infantry carriers artillery planes units of the Right Sector were sent to the southeast of Ukraine the Russian ambassador to the UN said. He also noted that instead of the conscientious joint work with the aim of helping Ukraine out of the crisis the United States and EU countries prefer to spread malicious insinuations against Russias policy intrigue against Russia inventing the so-called sanctions that are senseless and counterproductive.

There are no doubts about Ukraines gas debt EU Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger said after the first tripartite meeting with the energy chiefs of Russia and Ukraine in the Polish capital on Friday. The European Commission intends to give financial assistance to Ukrainian energy company Naftogaz Ukrainy Oettinger said. Ukraine will continue its efforts at further three-party consultations with the European Union and Russia to have the price for Russian gas decreased to 268 USdollars per 1000 cubic metres Ukrainian Energy Minister YuriyProdan said on Friday after three-party talks with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and European Commissioner for Energy Gunter Oettinger. We are unable to pay almost 500 USdollars per 1000 cubic metres he said. The Ukrainian said has repeatedly asked the Russian side to return to the price of 268 USdollars per 1000 cubic metres. Ukraine has agreed to repay its debts at this price. If we fail to reach an agreement at the three-party consultations we will have to launch litigation. So we will meet at court on May 28 he said. Turchinov orders Naftogaz to secure Russian gas supplies at previous price Earlier Oettinger said that there were no doubts that Ukraine did have gas debts but the amount of such debts were subject to discussion. Kiev will discharge all its liabilities concerning gas transit to Europe Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuriy Prodan said. Ukraine will fulfill all its liabilities as concerns gas transit to Europe he pledged. Russia is worried over prospects for Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak added. The Russian minister noted that in order to ensure uninterrupted gas supplies to European countries it was necessary to store some 12 billion cubic metres of gas at Ukraines storage facilities during the summer period. We have heard from our Ukrainian colleagues that gas storing during the summer period is not guaranteed and problems with gas supplies are possible Novak said. It is very serious information for us which we must analyze. The European Union Russia and Ukraine will hold next gas talks in mid-May EU Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger said. A next meeting will be held in mid-May. We agreed to hold next two meetings in two and four weeks he said. Ukraine will have first yields of shale gas production not earlier than in five years Ukrainian Energy Minister YuriyProdan said. Ukraine signed contracts with Shell and Chevron on shale gas production he said. The results however will be seen in five years. At the same time he noted that Ukraine hoped to stabilize its economy thanks to the assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) so domestic gas consumption will grow.

He said that the use of force in the southeast of Ukraine was a manifestation of a crime of feebleness of Kievs rulers. Instead of taking effort to begin a normal dialogue in the spirit of the Geneva accords to make parties to the conflict sit down at a negotiating table to discuss compromise solutions they launched a punitive operation using landing parties and helicopters.

Lavrov Kerry state 92 prc of chemicals removed from Syria MOSCOW April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation on Saturday April 26 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that 92% of chemical material had been removed from Syria up to date. The Joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has confirmed delivery of a further shipment of chemical weapons material which has brought the total of chemical material removed and destroyed in country to 92.5% I welcome the significant progress of the last three weeks and I strongly encourage the Syrian authorities to conclude the removal operations as part of their efforts to achieve the 30 June 2014 deadline. Particular thanks goes to Member States for their steadfast support U.N./OPCW Joint Mission Special Coordinator Sigrid Kaag. In addition to the removal operations the Syrian authorities have destroyed buildings equipment and empty mustard gas containers and decontaminated other containers in a number of chemical weapons storage and production sites. A majority of these sites are now closed. Kaag said on April 22 that the removal of chemicals from Syria would be completed within the next few days. This will contribute to meeting the deadlines set by the OPCW Executive Council including the June 30 2014 target date for completing the destruction of Syrias entire chemical weapons programme. The renewed pace in movements is positive and necessary to ensure progress towards a tight deadline she said. According to the OPCW no chemical weapons will be left in Syria by April 27. They will be destroyed by Britain Germany the United States and Finland. When all of the Syrian chemicals from all storage sites have been loaded aboard the Danish and Norwegian cargo ships they will be transported to various locations for destruction under the verification of OPCW inspectors. The majority of Priority 1 chemicals will be neutralised at sea aboard the U.S. vessel MV Cape Ray while a smaller amount will be neutralised at a land-based facility in Ellesmere Port UK. The Priority 2 chemicals will be destroyed at commercial facilities in the U.S. and Finland. A facility in Germany will dispose of part of the effluent from the Cape Ray operations the OPCW said. The Syrian Government informed the Joint Mission of a revised plan for removing all relevant chemicals from its territory by April 27. The amended plan was considered by the OPCW Executive Council in The Hague in early March 7. Western countries were concerned that the delays would not allow Syria to destroy all of its chemical weapons by June 30 2014 as was initially planned and it will need a delay of several months. The removal of the most critical material for destruction began on January 7 2014 a week after the deadline for its completion set by an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States under which Syria renounced its chemical weapons material and joined 1992 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons. On November 15 2013 the OPCW Executive Council (EC) approved a detailed plan of destruction to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons stockpile. In the plan Syrian chemical weapons will be transported for destruction outside its territory to ensure their destruction in the safest and soonest manner and no later than June 30 2014. Under Security Council Resolution 2118 (2013) and decisions of the OPCW Executive Council Syrias entire chemical weapons programme is to be destroyed by June 30 2014. Syria renounced its chemical weapons material and joined 1992 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons under an agreement brokered last year by Russia and the United States.

Putin not authorized response to the Western sanctions despite government proposials MINSK April 30/ITAR-TASS/. The United States was initially behind the events in Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday. I think what is happening there now shows us who really managed the process from the start. But at first the United States preferred to stay in the background Putin told journalists when asked about his attitude toward America playing the lead in the situation around Ukraine. He said the fact that now the United States is in the foreground in the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis shows that the US "led this process initially but only displayed itself as the leader of this entire process now. Putin said that at first the interests of the United States and its European partners coincided because the European Union wanted to strike a well-known [association] agreement with Ukraine on terms that I believe were unprofitable for Ukraine. The previous Kiev government tried to fight it but the Western community followed another scenario implementing the military scenario an anti-constitutional coup an armed seizure of power he said. According to Putin the events initiators did not calculate what they could lead to. The Russian president said that although many people in Ukraine liked such a coup still many [people] dont like it and they disagree with that form of power change. He added that there is nothing democratic in that. Putin not authorized response to the Westernsanctions despite government proposials Putin also said the Russian government proposed imposing sanctions against the United States and the European Union in response to their sanctions but added that he has not authorized them yet. The government of the Russian Federation has already proposed some retaliatory steps. I think theres not need the head of state told journalists. However he said if something like that continues we will of course have to think about who and how works in the Russian Federation in the key branches of Russias economy including energy. We would not like to resort to some steps retaliatory measures I hope there will be no need Putin said. People should be taken into account their legal rights should be respected he said. The situation in Ukraine has been far from stable since a coup occurred in the country two months ago and new people were brought to power amid deadly riots triggered by President Viktor Yanukovichs decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the EU in November 2013 in order to study the deal more thoroughly. Yanukovich had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns in February. Russia does not recognize the new self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities but the West says they are legitimate. The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol a city with a special status on the Crimean Peninsula where most residents are Russians signed reunification deals with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation.

State Duma requests FAS to look into the price of mobile phone calls to Crimea Cellular phone communication companies' subscribers pay for their phone conversations between Crimea and the rest of Russia on the basis of international tariffs MOSCOW April 30/ITAR-TASS/. Cellular phone communication companies' subscribers pay for their phone conversations between Crimea and the rest of Russia on the basis of international tariffs even if a call is between subsidiaries of one and the same operator. Such a state of affairs angered Alexei Zhuravlyov State Duma Member from the United Russia party and he sent an appropriate enquiry to the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) the newspaper Izvestia writes on Wednesday. Zhuravlyov requests FAS "to look into validity of tariffs on cellular phone communication between Russia's new regions (Crimea and Sevastopol) and the rest of the country. Russia's mobile phone communication operators currently rate such phone calls as international communication" the newspaper points out. More than a month has passed since the signing of the treaty on Crimea's re-unification with Russia but cellular phone communication operators have not readjusted their operations the MP laments. At present Russian cellular phone operators are lacking communication networks of their own on the Crimean Peninsula. They provide services there via Ukrainian partners that have licenses for mobile communication in that country. However the MTS and VympelCom have their own subsidiaries there "MTS Ukraine" and "KievStar" respectively. Services for Megafon subscribers are provided in the networks of outside partners. Meanwhile FAS for its part told Izvestia that the MP's enquiry had not reached it yet.

Former deputies in western Ukraine speak out against march commemorating SS division KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Former deputies of the town hall in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov who held seats during the first democratic convocation of the legislature in the early 1990s have spoken out against the March of Magnificence of the Spirit (also known as the march of embroidered blouses) scheduled for Sunday to mark a yet another anniversary since the setting up of the Halichina division of the SS by Nazi forces during World War II. The former deputies who were elected to the town hall in 1990 and thus became the founding fathers of regional legislative nationalism issued a special statement in connection with the march. It is noteworthy that the municipal authorities in Lvov and numerous public associations have espoused a radically opposite point of view as regards the marches of the embroidered blouses throughout all the years of Ukraines independence. Nazi ideology was implanted both at general schools (a special textbook on history was written for the Lvov school system) and at all levels of public life. A testimony to this can found in a downtown restaurant styled to a dugout hut of paramilitaries of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army which is profiled there as a highlight of cultural life. Interior and law enforcement agencies in Lvov have traditionally turned a blind eye to the situations where the radicals beat up the veterans of World War II who had fought on the Soviet side of the frontline. The Lvov town hall of the first democratic convocation consisted for the most part of the deputies representing the Rukh (Pathway) party and other nationalistic organizations.

MOSCOW April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Russia celebrates Day of Russian Parliamentarism on Sunday April 27 2014. The memorable date was instituted by the June 27 2012 federal law introducing amendments in Article 1.1 of the federal law on days of military glory and memorable dates in Russia. The first Russian State Duma started working on this day in 1906. Last Russian Emperor Nicholas II issued a manifesto on establishing the State Duma as a legislative and consultative body on August 6 1905. However on October 17 1905 the all-Russia political strike made the emperor sign a manifesto on improvement of the state order which vested the Duma with powers of a lawmaking body. A festive opening ceremony of the first Duma was held on April 27 1906. The total number of its members ranged between 480 and 524 in different years. The countrys parliament was empowered to endorse the laws submitted by the government and approve the state budget. In the parliament prior to the revolutionary years party factions were formed. The Duma has introduced the procedure for considering legislative initiatives openness of its meetings deputy requests and settlement of disagreements by conciliatory committees. The law granted the right for freedom of speech at the parliamentary rostrum to lawmakers that was particularly important in Russia in those years. Tsarist Russia has had the four Dumas until the overthrow of monarchy. From the very start of its activity the parliament engaged in confrontation with authorities. As a result from four convocations only the third Duma has worked for the whole legitimate five-year term. The first Duma has worked only for 72 days from April 27 to July 8 1906 being disbanded by Nicholas II. The same fate befell the second State Duma that has worked from February 20 to June 3 1907. This Duma was disbanded over the accusation against the Social Democratic faction of a military coup. The third Duma has worked from November 1 1907 to June 9 1912. The last Duma in the history of Imperial Russia has operated from November 15 1912 until October 6 (19) 1917. In 1917 the February Revolution occurred in the country that resulted in the toppling of the monarchy and a dual power in the country between the Provisional Government and the Council of Workmens and Soldiers Deputies. The Provisional Government attempted to form a new parliament and elections in the first all-Russia Constituent Assembly were held in November 1917. But the Bolsheviks have disbanded the All-Russia Constituent Assembly already on January 6 1918. After the October Revolution in 1917 the All-Russia Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) became the supreme legislative body of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). After establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922 the Central Executive Committee with one house was formed and a two-house supreme state body was founded in 1924 to work between the Congresses of Soviets of the Soviet Union. A two-house Supreme Council has replaced the All-Russia Central Executive Committee in 1936. In the early 90s after the Soviet Union breakup introduction of the post of RSFSR president and re-division of functions between different branches of power became an important change in the state system. The Federal Assembly became a representative and legislative body of Russia according to the Constitution enacted in 1993. The Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation consists of two houses - the Federation Council upper house and the State Duma lower house. The State Duma comprising 450 lawmakers is formed in national direct elections and represents the countrys population in general the Federation Council consisting of 170 members acts as a representative body of constituent entities of the federal state [by one representative from representative and executive authorities in each Russian federal constituent entity]. Lawmakers of the State Duma and the Federation Council work on a professional permanent basis. The State Duma is elected for a five-year term fixed in the countrys Constitution the Federation Council does not have a limited term of powers. Lawmaking is the main function of the State Duma particularly endorsement of federal and constitutional laws resolutions within its jurisdiction. The Federation Council has the main goal to perform legislative powers including consideration of laws approved by the State Duma ratification and denouncement of international treaties the issues of status and protection of the state border the matters of war and peace. The State Duma declares an amnesty empowers the president to appoint the prime minister settles the issue of trust to the government the issue of bringing accusations against the president for his impeachment and hears a governmental report. The Federation Council has the powers to announce presidential elections and to relieve the president from the post. The Federation Council appoints the judges of the Constitutional Court the Supreme Court and the general prosecutor. The State Duma appoints and relieves from the post the Central Bank chairman and the human rights commissioner. Parliamentary houses divide powers to appoint the leadership and auditors of the Chamber of Accounts and members of the Central Election Commission. Meetings of both parliamentary chambers are held separately. First elections in the State Duma in modern Russian history were held on December 12 1993. Lawmakers of the second State Duma were elected on December 17 1995 the third Duma - on December 19 1999 the fourth one - on December 7 2003 the fifth one - on December 2 2007 and the sixth State Duma - on December 4 2011. The first Duma was elected for two years the term of next four lower houses has made four years and current sixth State Duma was elected for five years. Elections in the lower house of parliament were held according to the mixed election system from single-seat constituencies and the federal district [federal lists of candidates] from 1993 to 2003. Fifth and sixth State Dumas were elected according to the proportional system on federal candidate lists nominated by political parties. In 2016 elections in a seventh State Duma will be held according to the mixed election system that envisages that half of deputies [225 lawmakers] will be elected in single-mandate constituencies and another half of lawmakers - in the federal electoral district. The law to this effect was enacted on February 24 2014. At elections in the incumbent sixth State Duma four parties from seven ones registered in the country at that moment were elected in the parliament and formed their factions in the lower house. United Russia Party has gained 238 mandates the Communist Party of Russia (CPRF) - 92 seats A Just Russia Party - 64 seats and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) - 56 mandates. From 2011 Valentina Matviyenko occupies the post of the Federation Council speaker Sergey Naryshkin - the State Duma speaker.

The president of Russias Rosneft oil company Igor Sechin considers his blacklisting among other officials over events in Ukraine as a high mark to the efficiency of his companys activity. Whatever is excessive is insignificant as French politician Charles Maurice de Talleyrand used to say in such cases Sechin told the Izvestia daily. What are the motives the US authorities are guided by? We understand it this way: the American administration paid attention to Rosneft activity towards the reduction of risks connected with one-sided orientation of our hydrocarbon exports at certain regional markets. I qualify the latest moves by Washington as the highest marks to the efficiency of our activity he said. We assure our shareholders and partners including American ones that this efficiency will not decrease and our co-operation will not only stay undamaged but will develop dynamically Sechin told the newspaper. On April 28 the United States announced new sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. The recent measures concern seven officials including two members of President Putins inner circle who will be subject to an asset freeze and a US visa ban and 17 companies linked to Putins inner circle which will be subject to an asset freeze. The sanctions have involved Oleg Belaventsev presidential envoy to the Crimean Federal District; Sergei Chemezov head of Rostec state corporation; Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak; Yevgeny Murov head of the Federal Protective Service; Alexei Pushkov a lawmaker; Igor Sechin; and Vyacheslav Volodin first deputy head of the presidential administration. The US Department of Commerce has imposed additional restrictions on 13 of those companies by imposing a license requirement with a presumption of denial for the export re-export or other foreign transfer of US-origin items to the companies.

The Kiev authorities have been conducting an antiterrorism operation in eastern Ukraine SLAVYANSK May  Air Force combat helicopters are in the sky above the east Ukrainian city of Slavyansk the city is fully blocked fighting is underway a representative of the militia told Itar-Tass by phone on Friday. He said that he has no confirmed information on those injured or killed. Earlier the representative said the Ukrainian authorities were conducting a full-scale sweep operation in Slavyansk using aircraft and landing troops against civilians. The operation started at 5 a.m. as they [Kiev leaders] pledged. Armored vehicles are securing the assault by landing troops the militiaman said. He said he is at a checkpoint in the city center. Massive protests against the new Ukrainian authorities who were propelled to power in Kiev amid riots during a coup in Ukraine in February erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern regions in March after Crimea's incorporation by Russia. Demonstrators who are demanding referendums on the countrys federalization seized some government buildings. The Kiev authorities have been conducting an antiterrorism operation in eastern Ukraine. Russia which does not recognize the de facto Ukrainian leaders brought to power by the coup has condemned the operation apparently aimed to crack down on Ukrainian nationals supporting federalization. Crimea's urge to reunify with Russia was caused by the republic's refusal to accept the new Kiev authorities. In a March 16 referendum Crimeans overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and accede to Russia. The reunification deal with Moscow was signed March 18.

White House spokesman said the United States will continue working jointly with Germany and other European Union members to develop a common approach to sanctions against Russia WASHINGTON May 02./ITAR-TASS/. The situation in Ukraine will dominate the agenda of talks that will be held on Friday by US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel White House spokesman Jay Carney confirmed Thursday. Theres no question that the situation in Ukraine... will be a focus of the conversation Carney told journalists. He accused Moscow of what he called "the continued failure by Russia to abide by its commitments in the Geneva agreement". Carney said the United States will continue working jointly with Germany and other European Union members to develop a common approach to sanctions against Russia. The Geneva Statement was adopted after the April 17 meeting on Ukraine that involved Russia the United States the EU and Ukraine. Some Russian and Crimean officials and companies have been subjected to sanctions by Western nations after Crimeas incorporation by Russia which the West and the de facto Kiev authorities refuse to recognize legal despite Moscows repeated statements that the Crimean referendum on secession was in line with the international law. Russia has dismissed the threats of further sanctions against it saying such a language is counterproductive and will have a boomerang effect on Western nations. Ukraine saw a coup in February after months of anti-government protests. New people were propelled to power amid riots as President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns. Russia does not recognize the de facto Ukrainian authorities. Crimea where most residents are Russians held a referendum March 16 in which it overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and reunify with Russia. The accession deal with Moscow was signed March 18. After Crimeas accession to Russia protests against the new Ukrainian authorities in Kiev erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern regions with demonstrators demanding referendums on the countrys federalization and taking control of some government buildings. Kiev has been conducting an antiterrorism operation in eastern Ukraine apparently aimed to clamp down on federalization supporters. Russia has condemned the operation. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday dismissed Western claims that Russia could be involved in pro-federalization protests in southeastern Ukraine. People say our special forces are present there [in Ukraine] say we have sent instructors there.

Duma to consider in autumn amendments to law on retailers cost saving MOSCOW April 27 /ITAR-TASS/. The State Duma lower house of Russias parliament in autumn will return to the consideration of amendments to legislation that are aimed at cost saving for retailers RF First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview to the Rossiya 24 news television channel. We promised to the retail store networks that we will help them for example to write off the networks costs related to theft. Representatives of retail store networks say that the meagre percentage to which they are entitled under Russian legislation (retailers are allowed to include less than one percent from the proceeds in the sum related to products losses due to theft) is totally inadequate it is different from that of the EU countries and the United States Shuvalov said. In addition he noted retailers are dissatisfied with the requirement to maintain the trade outlets infrastructure and render an account of it in a manner that differs from the foreign practice. The request this kind of interaction from us and we are ready to provide it. But we say: please show us your progress regarding how you interact with food producers how you eliminate these malpractices that are forced on you by the suppliers of products and how you use the dispute resolution mechanism. So as soon as we see this progress in reality we will certainly respond the first deputy prime minister said. We have arranged with the State Duma security committee and economy committee to suspend so far these bills that are in favour of the retail store networks and return to this issue in autumn and see the current practice of interaction with food producers. If anything has changed for the better or not and then we will introduce certain benefits for them which in essence will mean spending from the regional budgets. Because they ask for certain benefits and will pay less taxes Shuvalov said. He stressed that the RF government and State Duma were ready to meet the retail store networks halfway only if they start to develop competitive relations and that there will be no cartels no collusions that food producers will have the possibility to come to retail networks and without any exactions additional forced services to supply their products for sale.

With the price of $ 485.5 per 1000 cubic metres Ukraine can pay for Russian gas at reduced price or will go to court MOSCOW April 30./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraines overall debt for Russian gas grows to $ 3.492 billionRussias natural gas giant Gazprom spokesperson Sergei Kupriyanov said on Wednesday April 30. Ukraines overall debt for Russian gas according to preliminary estimates will be $3.492 billion onsidering Naftogaz of Ukraines request for April 30 and the volumes we have already delivered this month he said. Naftogaz of Ukraine had imported 2.250 billion cubic metres of gas worth $1.09 billion by April 26. The request for import in the remaining days of April is 110 million cubic meters per day. The overall amount of gas to be imported by Ukraine in April will be 2.7 billion cubic metres. With the price of $ 485.5 per 1000 cubic metres Ukraines debt will increase by $ 1.3 billion by May 1 to reach $ 3.5 billion. The European Commission said it was ready to help Ukraine pay the gas debt. However acting Energy and Coal Industry Minister Yuriy Prodan has so far not stated readiness to pay for the gas supplied by Gazprom. The agreement on reverse-flow gas supplies assigned with Slovakia will not allow Ukraine to meet its needs without Russian gas. Ukraine consumes 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually and produces 20 billion cubic metres (including Crimea). Reverse-flow supplies will amount to 3.2 billion cubic metres from Slovakia and to 1.5 billion cubic metres from Poland. Hungary may supply 5 billion cubic metres. This will allow Ukraine to make up for one-third of imports from Russia. Ukraine is ready to pay its debt to Russias Gazprom for gas supplies at a price of $268.5 per 1000 cubic metres Prodan said. Ukraine is ready to pay the debt. But we cannot pay the price Gazprom set from April 1. It is unjustifiably high and is about $500. We are ready to pay under our obligations the minister said. European Commission Ukraine back gas talks with Russia in Warsaw on May 2 Ukrainian Energy Ministry advises Gazprom to collect gas debt through arbitration court Ukraine imports Russian gas for national needs only minister Russia to shift to system of prepayments for gas soon - Medvedev He said that the Ukrainian gas transit system would be incorporated into the European gas transportation system. We can also use the possibilities of our underground gas storage facilities and hope that European gas companies will build up their reserves in our storage facilities he said. According to Prodan reverse-flow supplies can reach 8 billion cubic metres by September 1 2014 not by 2015. Gas will be supplied by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline not the transit pipeline. EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said such supplies would not require the Russian companys agreement and would give Ukraine up to 10 billion cubic metres of a gas a year but stressed that reverse-flow gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine by the trunk pipeline would be impossible without Gazproms consent as it would run counter to the Slovak company Eustreams contractual obligations. Oettinger believes that diversification of supplies will help to solve Ukraines gas problem in part. However reverse-flow supplies from Poland and Hungary by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline will not be enough for Ukraine get through the coming winter comfortably. He also said that the European Union was providing support to Kiev on the repayment of its gas debt to Russia. The throughput capacity of the Ukrainian gas transportation is 288 billion cubic metres system at the entrance and 178.5 billion cubic meters at the exit including 142.5 billion cubic metres to European countries and 3.5 billion cubic metres to Moldova. Natural gas transit through Ukraine to Europe and CIS countries in 2011 increased by 5.7% from 2010 to 104197067000 cubic metres including to Western Europe by 5.9% to 101098013000 cubic metres but decreased by 2.4% to 3099054000 cubic metres to CIS countries. Ukraines gas transportation system consists of 72 compressor stations 110 production shops and 1451 gas distribution stations. The overall length of gas pipelines operated by the company is 38600 kilometres including 22200 kilometres of trunk pipelines and 16400 kilometres of extensions.

Rosneft to invest almost $12 billion in gas projects until 2018 Rosneft became the third largest gas producer in Russia in 2013 CEO sees sanctions against him as high marks to Rosneft oil company MOSCOW April 30 18:06 /ITAR-TASS/. The Russian state-owned oil major Rosneft will invest 400 billion roubles ($11.9 billion) in investment projects until 2018 the companys Vice President Svyatoslav Slavinsky said on Wednesday April 30. These include not only Rospan and Kharampur but a number of other major projects as well he said adding that Rosneft was drafting a gas strategy for a period of at least 30 years. Based on 2013 performance Rosneft became the third largest gas producer in Russia having produced 38.17billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas. The record-setting more than two-fold increase of gas production is related primarily to the addition of large gas assets following acquisition of TNK and consolidation of NGK Itera. In 2013 the Company worked to lay the foundation for the future growth of is gas business through organic growth of gas production. Among other things the Company focused its efforts on active development of the Rospan project (development of the  and Novo-Urengoiskoe license blocks) and obtaining approval for a comprehensive field development plan for gas deposits of the Kharampurskoe field. Gas sales in 2013 amounted to 39.07 bcm including 24.02 bcm in West Siberia 10.42 bcm in the European part of Russia and 0.94 bcm outside of Russia. Thanks to its considerable reserves Rosneft has an immense production increase potential. Rosneft investments in Far East to reach 79 billion rubles by 2015 Rosneft president Gas value assurance is one of Rosnefts strategic objectives. The Company is planning to expand its presence in the gas market and is actively pursuing this sector of business executing direct gas delivery contracts with major consumers. By 2020 the company is planning to produce 100 bcm of gas per year which is estimated to make a two-fold increase in its domestic market share (to circa 20%). LNG market presents one of the opportunities for Rosnefts gas reserves monetisation. Working with ExxonMobil the company is studying feasibility of building a 5 million tonnes per annum LNG plant in the Russian Far East. Rosneft is considering several gas sales options for the proposed plant. The Company has already signed LNG contracts with Japanese Marubeni and Sodeco. Stable LNG demand in Asia-Pacific countries guarantees Rosneft a sustainable market for that project. Some of the future production volumes of the proposed plant have been contracted by one the worlds trading leader the Vitol company which allows Rosneft to diversify risks in the global LNG trading market. At this time Rosneft is successfully implementing its programme to bring its associated gas utilisation ratio to 95% Rosneft is included in the list of strategic companies and organisations of Russia. The main company shareholder (69.50%) is OJSC ROSNEFTEGAZ a 100% state-owned company. BP owns another 19.75% and the remaining 10.75% of shares are publicly traded.

Neo-Nazis holding action in Lvov to commemorate Ukrainian SS division KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. An action of pro-Nazi Ukrainian nationalists dedicated to a yet another anniversary since the setting up of the Halichina Ukrainian division of the SS was held in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov Sunday local news media said. Several hundred radicals gathered near the monument to the most odious figure in the history of Ukrainian nationalism Stepan Bandera. The organizers said about 3000 people might take part all in all. Earlier on the same day former deputies of the Lvov town hall who had seats there in the first democratically elected convocation in the early 1990s issued a highly untypical statement voicing protest against the street march of the neo-Nazis which they said might inflict damage on the countrys national unity. The Lvov town hall of the first democratic convocation consisted for the most part of the deputies representing the Rukh (Pathway) party and other nationalistic organizations. It is noteworthy that the municipal authorities in Lvov and numerous public associations have espoused a radically opposite point of view as regards the marches of the embroidered blouses throughout all the years of Ukraines independence. Nazi ideology was implanted both at general schools (a special textbook on history was written for the Lvov school system) and at all levels of public life. A testimony to this can found in a downtown restaurant styled to a dugout hut of paramilitaries of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army which is profiled there as a highlight of cultural life. Interior and law enforcement agencies in Lvov have traditionally turned a blind eye to the situations where the radicals beat up the veterans of World War II who had fought on the Soviet side of the frontline.

Russian Defence Minister said the increase in the activity of the U.S. and NATO armed forces in Eastern Europe near the Russian border was unprecedented MOSCOW April  Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu flatly denied unfounded assertions about the presence of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in Ukraine where they are allegedly destabilising the situation in south-eastern regions of the country. In a telephone conversation on Monday April 28 Shoigu and his U.S. counterpart Chuck Hagel had a frank one-hour conversation and exchanged concerns about tensions in Ukraine the Defence Ministry press service said. At the same time Shoigu said that under the pretext of fighting terrorism the Kiev regime had amassed about 80 tanks over 130 armoured personnel carriers and fighting vehicles at least 60 artillery systems and mortars in the South-East of Ukraine. Combat aircraft and helicopters are engaged on a regular basis. The overall number of Ukrainian troops has reached 15000 personnel and all this against the peaceful population of their own country the minister said. The possibility of forceful actions against peaceful people caused Russia to start large-scale manoeuvres on the national territory in regions bordering on Ukraine. This decision was made public he said. However as soon as the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had no intention to use regular military units against unarmed people the Russian units were ordered back to their bases. Shoigu said the increase in the activity of the U.S. and NATO armed forces in Eastern Europe near the Russian border was unprecedented and stressed that these actions have been accompanied by provocative statements by the NATO Secretary-General on the need to deter Russia the ministry said. The Russian Defence Minister also drew the attention of his American colleague to the anti-Russian hysteria unleashed lately in the Western press which does not help to calm down passions the press centre said. Hagel said these steps had been undertaken by Washington and Brussels in response to the situation in Ukraine but they were not provocative or expansionist and aimed to demonstrate the bloc unity and increased defence capabilities of the allies. Shoigu reaffirmed his readiness to maintain contact with all sides concerned in order to de-escalate tensions in and around Ukraine. He also called for constructive dialogue and search for compromises on the basis of the Geneva accord of April 17. The minister also commented on the incidents in which two Russian Su-24 planes flew over the American destroyer Donald Cook in Black Sea on April 12 and a Russian Su-27 jet fighter escorted an American RC-135 plane over the Sea of Okhotsk on April 22. Shoigu suggested instructing the chiefs of the Russian and American General Staff to discuss possible additional measures to avoid misinterpretation of each others actions in the future. The minister and the secretary agreed to maintain close contact.

Russia insists on investigation of reports on involvement of the U.S. private military organization Greystone in the current events in Ukraine Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday in an interview with the Russia Today television channel. He said the military observers dispatched to Ukraine by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) had admitted the absence of any evidence of the presence of Russian military observers in eastern Ukraine. They noted only a possibility of the presence there of some kind of military advisers but he said they should continue watching the situation to understand the situation better. The only fact the Americans made references to was that the fighters (in eastern Ukraine - Itar-Tass) was the people there were using the weapons of Russian manufacture but everyone in Ukraine uses Russian weaponry for instance the Kalashnikov assault rifle or the Makarov handgun Lavrov said. This means a proof of this sort can scarcely be called sufficient. He also said reports had come several days ago on discovery of a cache with U.S. weaponry in Ukraine adding: This should necessarily be investigated. Lavrov recalled that the Russian side had raised the problem during contacts with U.S. counterparts. Some reports said several hundred specialists from the private military company Greystone had arrived Ukraine from the U.S. he said. Also reports said foreigners had been involved in several accidents. Americans told us they didnt have any information on this and then they said they had referred the question directly to Greystone and the organization had denied any involvement on its part. Still wed like to know who is doing certain things because there are too many deflections of reality otherwise if you use the language of diplomacy Lavrov said.

In Ukrainian crisis conditions Switzerland gives constructive dialogue example - official BELLINZONA (Switzerland) April 27 /ITAR-TASS/. Switzerland has shown an example of constructive dialogue and co-operation demonstrating in the difficult political situation the right approach to the solution of the acute problem that has been caused by the Ukrainian crisis deputy speaker of the Federation Council upper house of Russias parliament Yuri Vorobyov told Itar-Tass. He paid a working visit to Switzerland as a co-chair of the Switzerland-Russia inter-parliamentary friendship group. The position of Switzerland is very cautious and is based on an attempt to preserve its neutrality and simultaneously not to break relations with the European Union Vorobyov said. But nevertheless Switzerland is showing an example of constructive dialogue and co-operation. Switzerland today is a country in the European Union that demonstrates in the difficult political situation the right approach to the solution of the acute problem the FC member added. The co-chair of the friendship group from the Swiss side President of the Council of States (upper house) of the parliament of Switzerland Filippo Lombardi for his part expressed the hope for mediator efforts of the confederation especially in view of the fact that it chairs this year the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Switzerland currently presides in the OSCE and we hope that it will play its decisive role in the current difficult situation Lombardi said. Bern had previously refused to automatically repeat the EU and U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its position on Ukraine. At the same time the Federal Council (government) of Switzerland has taken measures not allowing the blacklisted by the EU persons to bypass the sanctions using Swiss banks. Thus they are prohibited to transfer money to Swiss banks however their existing accounts there will not be frozen. Vrorobyov also criticised the conduct of the majority of European parliamentarians in light of the Ukrainian crisis. In May we wanted to hold a meeting of the Association of European Senates but many countries have still not answered to this invitation or have refused he said. How can we settle complex political issues without meeting at the parliamentary level without discussing the hot issues and without hearing both sides the FC deputy speaker said calling such an approach an obvious demonstration of a counterproductive wrong conduct of politicians.

Ukrainian FM invites Russia to hold talks in Vienna April 28 It said that in reply to Kievs inquiry Moscow had failed to provide exhaustive explanations regarding the purpose and place of military manoeuvres held in the Southern and Western Military Districts KIEV April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has invited Russia to hold talks in Vienna on April 28 under the Vienna Document of April 28 on confidenceand security-building measures. It said that in reply to Kievs inquiry Moscow had failed to provide exhaustive explanations regarding the purpose and place of military manoeuvres held in the Southern and Western Military Districts over the past several days near the Ukrainian border the date of their completion and the number and type of military units involved. ICRC OSCE Kiev agree on visit to jailed Donetsk peoples governor Given the insufficient information received Ukraine has suggested to the Russian Federation that consultations be held in Vienna on April 28 as provided for in the abovementioned document in order to discuss this issue. Other states that have voiced concern about Russias military activities near the Ukrainian border have also been invited to take part in the consultations the Foreign Ministry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the Russia Today television channel this week that Russian troops were staying on their own territory and were not taking any steps that would go against their obligations. We have never denied the fact that we sent additional troops to the border [with Ukraine] just as the Ukrainian government redeployed its troops closer to our border. Our troops are conducting exercises on the territory of our own country. Such exercises are conducted regularly since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister Lavrov said. Exercises are held in different parts of Russia. As far as I know the next exercises will be held in the north-west of the country. This is a continuous process. The army must be in good shape and ready to act while hoping that it will not have to interfere the minister said. However if we are attacked we will respond by all means. If our legitimate interests and the interests of Russian people are directly affected as was the case in South Ossetia I see no way to respond other than doping so in full compliance with international law. Those who threaten the security of Russian citizens jeopardise the security of the whole country Lavrov said. He stressed the fact that Russian troops were staying on the territory of Russia. Demands for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document of 2011 and the Treaty on Open Skies were satisfied. Inspectors from the United States the European Union and Ukraine visited Russian troops bases and could not cite even one fact that would signify dangerous military activities on the part of Russia the minister said. We are on our own territory and are not taking any actions that would go against our obligations he said. Ukrainian troops are also staying on their territory but the difference is that they have an order allowing them to use weapons against peaceful citizens. This is a criminal order.

EU ambassadors to meet within hours to discuss further sanctions against Russia On April 28 the EU Council enlarged its black list to include ten more Russian citizens and five resistance leaders in eastern Ukraine BRUSSELS April 30. /ITAR-TASS/. The ambassadors of 28 EU countries will meet within hours to discuss further sanctions against Russia the European External Action Service (EEAS) said on Wednesday April 30. However no practical decisions are expected to be adopted at the meeting. The ambassadors will discuss the latest developments in Ukraine and further sanctions against Russia including trade and economic ones. The EEAS official denied assertions that the EU foreign ministers may meet on May 2 to discuss the situation in Ukraine as some European mass media reported earlier this week. He said no dramatic changes had occurred in the situation that would require an urgent meeting of the EU foreign ministers especially since they are to gather for a scheduled meeting in Brussels on May 12 anyway. Kerry: US may impose sanctions on whole sectors of Russian economy On April 28 the EU Council enlarged its black list to include ten more Russian citizens and five resistance leaders in eastern Ukraine thus bringing the total number of persons under sanctions to 48. All of them will be prohibited from entering the EU for six months and their assets in European banks if any will be frozen. Brussels made this move claiming that Russia had failed to take practical steps to implement the Geneva Statement of April 17 on the de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine and in view of the growing tensions in that country. However the EU has not been able to present any proof that Russia is exerting practical influence on the protesters in the South-East of Ukraine.

Russia surprised by distorted interpretation of Geneva statement by Kiev The Kiev authorities are doing nothing not moving a finger to eliminate the causes of the current deep crisis in Ukraine Sergei Lavrov said MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow is surprised by the distorted interpretation of the Geneva statement by the Kiev authorities and their American partners the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. The statement says that all illegal armed groups must be disarmed. However instead of taking effective measures to implement this agreement Kiev and Washington and some European capitals keep talking about the need to surrender arms only by Ukrainian citizens who are defending their rights in the southeast of Ukraine while turning a blind eye to the continuing provocations by militants from ultra-right forces specifically the so-called Right Sector both in Kiev and different cities in the South and East of the country which resulted in the loss of human life on the night to April 20 the ministry said. Russia continues to believe in the seriousness of our Western partners when they speak about their commitment to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the political crisis in Ukraine. However fact alas prove otherwise. We are still waiting for Kiev to fulfill its promises as it is responsible for fostering dialogue with Ukrainian regions including in the South-East the ministry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier this week urged Kiev to cancel orders on use of army against the population to disarm Right Sector militants and other ultranationalist groups release protesters in the south-eastern regions from detention and stop their prosecution and launch a comprehensive constitutional reform by taking real steps not by making declarations. Lavrov said that the Ukrainian authorities were not complying with the Geneva agreement. Joseph Biden: Russia should join OSCE mission in eastern Ukraine The Kiev authorities are doing nothing not moving a finger to eliminate the causes of the current deep crisis in Ukraine Lavrov said. The Right Sector has been running things in different cities in central and western Ukraine for almost half a year trying to spread its influence to the eastern regions by force he said. Buildings in Kiev which were seized by force at the start of the events in Ukraine have not been vacated the streets have not been unblocked and the Maidan [general term meaning public protests against the authorities] continues to boom excuse the term. The leaders appointed by the Verkhovna Rada [parliament] are saying openly that the Geneva agreement does not apply to the Maidan because the Kiev City Council or city administration has made the decision that the Maidan may stay on and that it is legitimate. This is absolutely unacceptable the minister said. The Geneva meeting on the situation in Ukraine on April 17 agreed on initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all citizens. All sides must refrain from any violence intimidation or provocative actions. The participants strongly condemned and rejected all expressions of extremism racism and religious intolerance including anti-Semitism. All illegal armed groups must be disarmed; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners; all illegally occupied streets squares and other public places in Ukrainian cities and towns must be vacated. Amnesty will be granted to protestors and to those who have left buildings and other public places and surrendered weapons with the exception of those found guilty of capital crimes. It was agreed that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission should play a leading role in assisting Ukrainian authorities and local communities in the immediate implementation of these de-escalation measures wherever they are needed most beginning in the coming days. The USA EU and Russia commit to support this mission in particular by providing observers. The announced constitutional process will be inclusive transparent and accountable. It will include the immediate establishment of a broad national dialogue with outreach to all of Ukraines regions and political constituencies and allow for the consideration of public comments and proposed amendments. The participants underlined the importance of economic and financial stability in Ukraine and would be ready to discuss additional support as the above steps are implemented.

Now we do not have more democracy. Some of Russian channels are banned in Ukraine journalists are detained political repression is underway army is engaged in a punitive operation against the people. Living standards are degrading and there are no conditions for their improvement he stressed. All that is going on is not what they promised to the people. That is why in his words Kiev is afraid that Ukraines central and western regions might follow the lead of the countrys southeast and arise. According to Tsariov the crisis in Ukraine could be resolved in just a few days if the Kiev authorities lend an ear to the demands of people living in southeastern regions of Ukraine. He said he had offered his candidature as a mediator between the authorities and protesters. There is a very simple way out of the current situation. I can speak with any protesters I am welcome everywhere he said. The authorities he stressed must show readiness to stop the army to take the troops back to their permanent garrisons to disband illegal armed groups to conduct amnesty and close cases against protesting officers of the riot police [Berkut] and to lend an ear to the demands about the status of the Russian language and the federalization of the country. To deescalate the conflict in his words the government should sit down at a roundtable and take a decision on amnesty and troops pullout. After that it must adopt a roadmap on amendments to be made to the constitution. We have out edition of the constitution and we are ready to present it to the government Tsariov said. It is much easier to try to reach an agreement than to kill own citizens he stressed. Earlier on Friday Tsariov said that the Kiev authorities were subordinate to the US administration. When in a span of two weeks the CIA director the US vice president and the head of the US Senate armed service committee pay visits to Kiev one has an impression that Ukraine is subordinate to the American administration he said. International cooperation is a good thing. But I dont want Ukraine to lose its political and economic independence he stressed.

Russia to take all steps to free detained OSCE observers VIENNA April 26 (Itar-Tass) - Detention of military observers from European countries near Slavyansk in Ukraine's Donetsk region hampers de-escalation of the conflict believes Andrei Kelin Russia's permanent representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia was ready to assist to free them he told reporters on Saturday. "We believe the people must be freed as soon as possible" he said. "Russia as an OSCE member will take all possible steps for it." "We do not know circumstances of what happened to them and where they are now but we as other members of the organization are deeply concerned over the incident" the diplomat added. "If they are detained it will not contribute to defusing of tension at the site and will not help de-escalate the conflict." Ukraine invited a group of observers in March in accordance with the Vienna document and responsible for their safety were those who invited the Ukrainian authorities he noted. As is known from media observers made a bold attempt to go to the zone where the situation was extremely tense and residents in the Donetsk region were on alert expecting an army operation to begin at any moment against peaceful protesters the Russian diplomat noted.

NEW YORK April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. Former Prime Minister and Batkivshchina (Fatherland) party leader Yulia Timoshenko said Ukraine must be a member of NATO even though a large part of people has many times spoken against this. In an interview with The Associated Press excerpts from which were published on Saturday April 26 Timoshenko who is running for presidency in Ukraine spoke of a fundamental change in public thinking following the latest events in the east of the country and Russias actions. She believes that the mentality of Ukrainians has changed as has the strategic course of the country. NATO is the best choice for Ukraine she said. The Associated Press said Timoshenko had previously not supported the idea of Ukraines membership in NATO. Timoshenko is confident that no Third World War will start over the events in Ukraine and believes that the world will not allow World War III. She also welcomed a new round of sanctions on Russia. Also Timoshenkohas urged her competitor Pyotr Poroshenko to revoke his proposal for talks with Russia. I want to stress once again that Pyotr Poroshenkos proposal to the Russian Federation that Russia should determine the place and time of the talks is unacceptable. The negotiation process being conducted in the EU-US-Ukraine-Russia format may not be broken Timoshenko said in a statement published on her partys official website on Saturday April 26. If any of the politicians breaks the negotiation process now and breaks the tough sanctions imposed upon Russia this will practically legalise the occupation of Crimea and acceptance of Russias ultimatums she said adding This will basically mean capitulation. Timoshenko urged Poroshenko not to break the negotiation process and to withdraw the proposal for a transition to such unclear bilateral negotiations. On Friday April 25 Poroshenko speaking at the Ukraine-Russia: Dialogue congress asked Moscow to name the place and time for talks while accusing Russia of being unwilling to implement the Geneva accord of April 17 which calls for de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine. Tycoon Pyotr Poroshenko is enjoying the biggest support among the constituencies according to public opinion polls published this week. They indicate that 32.9% of respondents are ready to vote for him in the upcoming presidential elections slated for May 25. Timoshenko is second and trailing far behind with 9.5% followed by MP Sergei Tigipko. In early April Poroshenko replying to a question whether Kiev wanted to join NATO urgently said No this does not depend on us; this depends on the organisation itself. We can feel that there is no consensus among its member countries on this issue. As president I would like to conduct negotiations with our neighbours about new alliances or additional security possibilities he said.

"It will be good if there are exchanges between the Morye and the Khabarovsk plant" he said.The Khabarovsk shipbuilding yard and the Feodosia Shipbuilding Company "Morye" are rivalingwhich gives an impetus to refining their operations.

Deputy NATO chief says alliance to have to treat Russia as adversary The events in Ukraine including Crimeas incorporation by Russia were the reason why the relations between NATO and Russia deteriorated NEW YORK May 02 /ITAR-TASS/. NATO will have to treat Russia more as an adversary rather than a partner a deputy secretary-general of the North Atlantic alliance said. Clearly the Russians have declared NATO as an adversary so we have to begin to view Russia no longer as a partner but as more of an adversary than a partner Alexander Vershbow said as quoted by US media. In central Europe clearly we [NATO and Russia] have two different visions of what European security should be like" Vershbow said Thursday. He stressed that the alliance still would defend the sovereignty and freedom of choice of Russia's neighbors and accused Moscow of trying to re-impose hegemony and limit their [neighboring states] sovereignty under the guise of a defense of the Russian world. Vershbow told reporters that the events in Ukraine including Crimeas incorporation by Russia were the reason why the relations between NATO and Russia deteriorated. NATO suspended practical civilian and military cooperation with Moscow last month. Vershbow said the alliance is considering deployment of additional forces in Eastern Europe permanently or on a rotation basis in particular to strengthen the security of the Baltic states. We want to be sure that we can come to the aid of these countries if there were any even indirect threat he said. Earlier this week four Danish F-16 jets landed at the Estonian airbase Amari. The Danish contingent will as part of a NATO mission patrol the Baltic states airspace for four months. The second part of that mission is carried out by a Polish-British contingent from the Zokniai (Siauliai) airbase in Lithuania. Ukraine is in turmoil after a coup took place in the country in February with new people brought to power amid deadly riots as security concerns prompted President Viktor Yanukovich to leave Ukraine. The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol a city with a special status on the Crimean Peninsula where most residents are Russians struck agreements to reunify with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. Kiev and Western nations do not recognize Crimeas reunification with Russia despite Moscow's repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite conformed to the international law and the UN Charter and was in line with the precedent set by Kosovos secession from Serbia in 2008. After Crimea's accession to Russia protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern regions with demonstrators who are demanding referendums on the countrys federalization seizing some government buildings. Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim head of state Alexander Turchinov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has condemned the operation which is apparently aimed to crack down on federalization supporters. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday dismissed Western claims that Russia could be involved in pro-federalization protests in southeastern Ukraine. People say our special forces are present there [in Ukraine] say we have sent instructors there. Let me say in all responsibility that there are no Russian instructors special forces or troops of any kind there. We have no one there Putin said in the Belarusian capital Minsk where he went for integration talks with the leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan.

That is why the issue of further sanctions [against Russia] should remain pending said Gernot Erler the German governments co-coordinator for relations with Russia warning against the risks of new punitive measures against Russian officials. If it really comes to further sanctions the West will also have to reckon with retaliatory sanctions he noted. And then the question arises as to whether the spiral of reciprocal measures will be controllable at all. He said a third set of sanctions against Russia depended on whether Russia will bring escalation [of the crisis] to the point when secession from Kiev in the east of Ukraine like it was in Crimea will loom.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it would be wrong to think that U.S. allies could not cooperate with Moscow. Its wrong to think that if someone is an ally of the United States he cannot be a partner of Russia and vice versa he said after talks with his Chilean colleague Heraldo Munoz on Wednesday April 30. He said Washington wanted to work with countries that are members of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and are partners of Russia. Replying to a question from a Chilean reporter whether his Latin American tour was undertaken in response to the U.S. moves against Russia over the crisis in Ukraine Lavrov said the very way the question was put was wrong. There is nothing I can say to this. It [question] is based on the wrong understanding of the situation and Chiles policy in world affairs he said. Lavrov said relations between Moscow and Santiago were valuable all by themselves and this had been borne out by his meeting with Chilean President Michele Bachelet.

On Friday Russias Air Transport Agency said that Ukraine aviation authorities had unilaterally banned Russian air companies to make flights to the eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Kharkov starting from Friday May 2. Russias air transport authority noted that this ban was an unprecedented violation of international air traffic agreements encroached strongly on the rights of passengers and led to a humanitarian blockade of residents in south-eastern Ukrainian regions. The Russian Air Transport Agency stressed that it would not take similar measures and would not close Russias air space for Ukrainian airlines.

The United States cant admit that it is unable to manage processes around the world from Washington single-handedly Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with RT television channel. As I said the point is not Ukraine. Ukraine is only one case that shows the United States unwillingness to make concessions in the geopolitical struggle Lavrov said. The Americans are not ready to admit that they cant single-handedly run the show in all corners of the planet from Washington that they cant impose their ready decisions on everyone he said. And they cant realize that is I think they are already beginning to realize but still keep instinctively adhering to the position that they dont need to take into account the opinions and interests of others the Russian foreign minister said. You know that in response to a demand to vacate the illegally occupied buildings in Kiev [US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs] Victoria Nuland said that everything that is still being held by protesters is being held with licenses and with the agreement of the government of Ukraine or with regular leases from the owners of the building he said. Its just incredible! Its hard to believe that they may use such arguments seriously Lavrov said. Sergei Lavrov called on the United States on Wednesday to stop thinking exclusively of geopolitical interests when dealing with the Ukraine crisis. In an interview with RTLavrov said Ukraine was only a manifestation of the USunwillingness to make concessions in its geopolitical struggle. As I said the point is not Ukraine. Ukraine is only a manifestation of USunwillingness to retreat in geopolitical struggle the Russian foreign minister went on to say. The situation in Ukraine is far from stable after a coup occurred in the country in February following months of anti-government protests often violent triggered by President Viktor Yanukovychs decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the European Union in November 2013 in order to study the deal more thoroughly. Amid riots during which radicals seized some government buildings in Kiev new people were brought to power whom Russia does not recognize as Ukraine's legitimate leaders. The self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities appear unable to restrict radicals and ultranationalists. The crisis deepened when Crimea where most residents are Russians refused to recognize the legitimacy of the de facto Ukrainian leadership. Crimea reunified with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which it overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. After the reunification which Kiev and Western countries do not accept despite Russias repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern territories with demonstrators taking control of some government buildings and demanding referendums on the countrys federalization. Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim president Oleksandr Turchynov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region apparently aimed to crack down on pro-federalization protesters.

Russian manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks sells Ukrainian segment of business to partner MOSCOW April 28./ITAR-TASS/. Russias leading manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks KAMAZ Group sold its Ukrainian segment of distribution and customer service business to a foreign partner materials released by the company say. Uncertainties of the economic and political situation in Ukraine and the slide of the hrivnas exchange rate against the major international currencies have depressed liquidity and toughened the terms for borrowings KAMAZ says. In March 2014 the group sold its business related to the sales and customer servicing in Ukraine to a foreign partner the report says. At the end of 2013 the assets of the group vulnerable to the risks arising from the situation in Ukraine stood at around 760 million rubles (USD 1 is equivalent of 36.0 rubles at the current exchange rate). As a result the group posted revenue of 58 million rubles. In December 2013 KAMAZ purchased 42.07% in the company KAMAZ Vectra Motors Ltd. thus building up its package to 100%. It paid 68 million rubles for the transaction. The joint-venture and sells cars and does customer support belonged to an Indian company then. In the aftermath of the purchase KAMAZ has nineteen joint-ventures at the moment. In February 2014 KAMAZ paid off the second tranche of bonds in the amount of 3 billion rubles and it opened a range of new loan facilities to the tune of 3.7 billion rubles. An average interest rate under these facilities totals 9% annual and the debts mature in the period of 2019 through to 2022. The groups liabilities on these loans stood at 36 million rubles on the reporting date the report says. KAMAZ occupies the 16th position in the world among the leading manufacturers of heavy-duty and the eighth position as regards the manufacturing of diesel-powered engines. The groups technological chain embraces eleven automobile factories and subsidiary enterprises. The list of its shareholders includes the Cyprus-registered Avtoinvest Ltd. (20.61%) and Decodelement Services Limited (2.73%) the German car manufacturer Daimler (11%) the U.S.-based KAMAZ International Managememt (4.25%) and a number of others.

The US may abolish sanctions against Russia if it takes steps towards de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine. Brent Hartley Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs stated this on Tuesday delivering a speech at a Chamber of Representatives session in US Congress. He has confirmed that Obamas administration still intends to use in its relationship with Russia both diplomacy and sanctions although it admits that all disputable issues linked to the Ukrainian crisis may be eventually solved only by diplomatic means. Hartley noted that until recently Washington had been imposing sanctions on Moscow in several phases and only then when diplomatic efforts once again proved fruitless. However the scale of the sanctions can be changed. They are flexible Hartley said. If the Russians decide they want to ensure de-escalation of the situation and behave in accordance with international standards again then we can lift the sanctions. But even as we tighten our approach to solving these issues we want to leave the door open for a diplomatic solution the official said adding that the USA was still hoping for the implementation of Geneva accords on Ukraine reached April 17. When asked by congressmen about the goal of American sanctions the State Department representative stated that thus the USA intends to influence Russia's behavior and return it to compliance with the international norms. He recalled that similar measures were taken by the EU Canada and Japan as well as several other states not included in the G7 or in the EU. Hartley believes that in this sense it is possible to speak about a broad international coalition. However when the American lawmakers asked whether such measures look effective and would it be possible to achieve anything in this way Hartley said: It may be a long process. Earlier Moscow repeatedly stated that it discards US and EU sanctions regarding the developments in Ukraine. Language of ultimatums is unacceptable the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized. The ministry also pointed to the fact that foreign partners were groundlessly accusing Russia of not fulfilling Geneva accords while Kiev authorities were applying force against protesters in eastern Ukraine and did not do anything to provide broad participation of all the countrys regions in drafting a constitution and preparing for the elections.

Russia may respond tit-for-tat to Western sanctions - upper house speaker Sanctions against Russia will not have any serious influence on our economy the speaker of the Federation Council the upper house of Russias parliament says No reasons to hurry with retaliatory sanctions on US EU MOSCOW April 29. /ITAR-TASS/. Valentina Matviyenko the speaker of the Federation Council the upper house of Russias parliament does not rule out that Russia may draft tit-for-tat measures in response to Western sanctions. This is the case when we should respond tit-for-tat draft response measures so that no one can talk to Russia in this language Matviyenko told journalists while commenting on expansion of Western sanctions against Russia. She said that such measures should be worked out the Federation Council would support them. According to Matviyenko sanctions against Russia will not have any serious influence on our economy. What the West can be thanked for is that they consolidate Russian society more and more by such actions. Russia has a great margin of safety to react to possible losses from such sanctions the speaker said adding that it will make it possible to diversify Russias economy including through increasing the output of high-tech products. As regards sanctions as pressure upon Russia designed to make it change its foreign policy this is totally unacceptable with any sovereign state in the world especially with such a powerful and influential state as Russia that plays a huge role in the global politics and economy she stressed. The Official Journal of the European Union on Tuesday made public the names of another 15 people subject to EU sanctions in the form of entry bans and asset freezes until the end of November. The list contains 15 names of Russian officials and Ukrainian southeastern resistance members namely: Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak presidential plenipotentiary in the Crimean Federal District Oleg Belaventsev Crimean Affairs Minister Oleg Savelyev Sevastopol federal city governor Sergey Menyailo senator from Crimea Olga Kovitidi deputy speakers of Russias State Duma the lower house of parliament Lyudmila Shvetsova and Sergey Neverov. The list also includes the names of Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Director Igor Sergun Russian Armed Forces General Staff Chief Valery Gerasimov GRU officer Igor Strelkov militia leaders in Ukraines southeast German Prokopyev and Valery Bolotov head of the proclaimed Donetsk Peoples Republic (DNR) Andrey Purgin DNR leaders Denis Pushilin and Sergey Tsyplakov. Western countries have imposed targeted sanctions on some Russian and Crimean officials following Crimeas reunification with Russia in March but Moscow has responded tit-for-tat. Russian FM: Crisis in Ukraine was caused by coup supported by West The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol a city with a special status on the Crimean Peninsula where most residents are Russians signed reunification deals with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. The developments came after a coup in Ukraine in February when new people were brought to power in Ukraine amid deadly riots triggered by President Viktor Yanukovychs decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the EU in November 2013 in order to study the deal more thoroughly. Yanukovych had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns the same month. Crimea refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities. Russia does not recognize the new Ukrainian leaders who appear unable to restrain radicals and ultranationalists either. Despite Russias repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law and the UN Charter and in conformity with the precedent set by Kosovos secession from Serbia in 2008 Kiev and Western countries do not recognize Crimeas accession to Russia. After Crimea's incorporation by Russia protests against the new Kiev leaders erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern regions. Demonstrators who are demanding referendums on the countrys federalization seized some government buildings. The West has already expanded its sanctions against Russia since they were first imposed and has threatened Russia with new economic sanctions unless Moscow changes its foreign policy. Moscow has said the imposition of sanctions against it is counterproductive and will have a boomerang effect on Western nations. In the Soviet Union Crimea used to be part of Russia until 1954 when Nikita Khrushchev the first secretary of the USSRs Communist Party transferred it to Ukraine's jurisdiction as a gift.

Lavrov urges OSCE to press for speedy release of political prisoners in Ukraine MOSCOW April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation with Swiss Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairperson in Office Didier Burkhalter on Saturday April 26 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of  arrests of public activists in the South-East of Ukraine and urged him to press for their speediest release. Burkhalter told Lavrov that the OSCE had secured access to Donetsk Region peoples governor Pavel Gubarev and would publish a memo on his condition after the visit scheduled for April 26. On Thursday April 24 Lavrov said Moscow had sent official letters to the OSCE and the ICRC requesting immediate access to Gubarev. We will push for immediate access to Gubarev to make sure that he has no problems with health Lavrov said. We will of course continue efforts aimed at ensuring his immediate release as a political prisoner. Lavrov said in an interview with the RT television channel on April 23 that despite an agreement on amnesty for political prisoners Donetsk Region peoples governor Pavel Gubarev is in prison. Gubarev never seized buildings he was arrested only for calls for a referendum on federalisation. Gubarev is a political prisoner. A crowd of demonstrators in a square in the centre of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on March 1 proclaimed Pavel Gubarev peoples governor. The Ukrainian Security Service SBU promptly opened a criminal case against him on the suspicion of calls for changing Ukraines borders. Gubarev detained on March 6 is being held in Kievs pre-trial detention centre. Having thanked Burkhalter for these efforts Lavrov drew his attention to other arrests of public activists in the South-East for political reasons and called on him to press for getting access to them and ultimately for their speediest release the Foreign Ministry said. Burkhalter said he was hoping to get from protesters in the south-eastern regions a complete list of such persons so that he could take necessary measures. He thanked Lavrov for Russias efforts to free the European military observers who had arrived in Ukraine at Kievs invitation under the Vienna Document of 2011 on confidence- and security-building measures and headed to south-eastern regions without properly notifying the public bodies that are controlling the situation in the region. On Friday April 25 supporters of federalisation in Slavyansk a city in the south-East of Ukraine detained a bus with passengers with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities. The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures. Yevgeny Gorbik a spokesperson for the supporters of federalisation told reporters that the detained military observers had been engaged in intelligence activities. The humanitarian group of the [OSCE] mission has denied any relation to them They [observers] had intelligence agents cryptograms and notebooks with secret notes Gorbik said. A Bulgarian officer had a notebook with notes in Russian which confirm his intelligence activities and speak of a meeting with agents he added. No charges have been brought against them so far. But theyve ended up in a company that calls into question the legitimacy of their activities Gorbik said adding The investigation is underway to find out what they were doing and where. Vyacheslav Ponomarev the peoples mayor of Slavyansk said the detained persons were not members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission but were military observers. The military were on our territory without our permission and were detained of course he said. What we should do with them we will know after we have determined who they are and what brought them here Ponomarev said adding that the detainees were being held in normal conditions. One of the military officials has diabetes but we have necessary medications and food [for him]. Ponomarev said the supporters of federalisation were ready to exchange the detained military for their comrades being held by the Kiev authorities. The Kiev junta is holding our comrades. But we are ready for an exchange if there is such a chance he said.

Army operation in southeast Ukraine to be Kievs last attack - Crimean leaders SIMFEROPOL May 01/ITAR-TASS/. The Ukrainian army offensive against regions controlled by militia in the South-East of the country will become the last attack of the present Kiev authorities Crimeas acting Head Sergei Aksyonov and Crimean State Council (parliament) Chairman Vladimir Konstantinov said on Thursday May 1 commenting on media reports about a possible resumption of the army operation in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. The crooks in Kiev do not understand that everything they are doing will boomerang on them personally. A war against ones own people has never done any good. We think they must be put on trial Aksyonov said adding At any rate history will make its own assessment of these villains who are sending troops against their own people. In his opinion a resumption of the army operation will produce a result opposite to that expected by Kiev. They still do not understand that all this will bring about resistance ten times stronger than now. The killing of peaceful people must not be forgiven no matter what goals are pursued. They must come to their senses Aksyonov said. We express our support to the people of the South-East of Ukraine who are legitimately fighting for their rights and freedoms he said. Konstantinov echoed him by saying that a resumption of the army operation in the south-eastern regions of Ukraine will be the last attack of the Kiev authorities. They touch one person and get a response ten times bigger. He believes that Kiev is creating a situation which cannot last forever. The people who have come to power in Kiev are inadequate. I wont be surprised if they proclaim Hitler their honorary leader tomorrow. I think that sooner or later this Nazi orgy will have to be stopped so that it does not bring disgrace upon the Russian world before the eyes of the whole planet Konstantinov said.

Gazety.ru reported on Wednesday that Microsoft Oracle Symantec and Hewlett-Packard have joined the American sanctions and are preparing for switching off the software for the companies that are put on the sanctions list. On April 28 the United States expanded the list of persons and companies on which sanctions are imposed. The United States included in it seven officials and 17 companies. The blacklisted persons are: Russia's presidential envoy to the Crimean Federal District Oleg Belaventsev Rostec Director General Sergei Chemezov Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak head of the Federal Protective Service (FSO) General Yevgeny Murov chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma lower house of Russian parliament Alexei Pushkov Rosneft head Igor Sechin first deputy head of the Russian presidential administration Vyacheslav Volodin. The list also includes the following companies: Aquanika (OOO Russkoye Vremya Moscow and the Nizhny Novgorod region) OOO Avia Group (Sheremetyevo) OOO Avia Group Nord (St. Petersburg) JSC ZEST (St. Petersburg) InvestCapitalBank (Ufa) Sobinbank (Moscow) OOO Sakhatrans (Vanino) Moscow-based Bank Severny Morskoi Put (Northern Sea Route) OOO Stroigazmontazh (Moscow) OOO Investment Company Abros (St. Petersburg) OOO Transoil (St. Petersburg) Volga Group (Luxemboug) Stroitransgaz Holding (Nicosia Cyprus) and its four subsidiaries. The USA imposed sanctions against Russia in response to its stance over Crimeas status. March 17 the USA announced a black list including 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials. In March and April the list has been expanded several times. To date the list includes several dozens of people who as US authorities believe undermine Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity. In addition the USA has suspended cooperation with Russia in the field of combating drug trafficking and in the space industry (except for the International Space Station project) and introduced restrictions for supplying military and double-purpose products to Russia.

Stopping the unlawful actions of the Kiev authorities is the main condition for resolving the current crisis in Ukraine Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. We believe that the main condition for resolving the crisis in Ukraine is to stop the unlawful actions of the Kiev authorities who must realize their responsibility for everything that was written down [in Kiev] on February 21 and in Geneva on April 17. It says clearly that there must be no violence. The use of the army with the support of radical nationalists against the people is an absolutely unacceptable form of violence. Moreover I think this is a criminal decision he said. It [the agreement] also speaks of the need to disarm these national radicals after all and calls for fighting terrorism religious intolerance and anti-Semitism the minister said. It also says that a truly comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue must be started. We see none of this happening. Kiev authorities should make first step toward national reconciliation Lavrov Lavrov urged the United States to use its influence to make the Kiev authorities assume responsibility for the current developments in Ukraine. I have no doubt that our American partners can influence the people who have proclaimed themselves a government in Kiev. The anti-terror operation was announced immediately after the behind-the-scene visit to Kiev by the CIA director and the Easter break in this operation announced by Kiev was broken right after [US] Vice President Joe Bidens visit there. By the way Joe Biden met with the leadership of the country basically as a head of state holding an internal meeting. He sat at the head of the table with Ukrainian officials flanking him on both sides the minister said.

Ukrainian representatives may accuse Russia of policies aimed at achieving dominance in BLACKSEAFOR National flags of the BLACKSEAFOR member states seen in Sevastopol (archive) MOSCOW April 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine will initiate Russias expulsion from the Black Sea Naval Co-Operation Task Group at a session of the BLACKSEAFORs High Level Experts Group due in Bulgaria in mid-May a military diplomatic source in Moscow told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. Under the decision of the present authorities in Kiev this initiative will be voiced at a next session of the group which will be held in May in Bulgaria supposedly in Varna the source said. The Ukrainian side will be motivating its initiative with Russias systematic violations of provisions of the 2001 agreement on the setting up of BLACKSEAFOR the source added. He said that upon instructions from the Kiev authorities the Ukrainian representatives in the task group would seek to achieve the goal through a set of successive moves. At a next session of the High Level Exerts Group Ukrainian representatives intend to accuse Russia of systematic violations of the 2001 agreement and demand the signing of a new document on BLACKSEAFOR without Russias participation. If this variant fails for some reason Ukraine will offer isolating Russia within BLACKSEAFOR as the US and its allies have been trying of late to do within the framework of the United Nations the source said.

"The quintessence of the Ukrainian demarche may become the statement that "hostile and aggressive policy of Russia towards other participants made this BLACKSEAFOR naval structure inefficient and unsustainable and therefore it was necessary to enter into a new agreement on BLACKSEAFOR but without the participation of Russia " the source added.

Kiev has no legal grounds for halting water supply to Crimea - deputy premier SIMFEROPOL April 26 22:19 /ITAR-TASS/. Kiev has no legal grounds for halting water supply to Crimea its First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev told ITAR-TASS on Saturday April 26. The Kiev junta has once again shown its real face he said. There is no and will be no shortage of drinking water in Crimea. But there will certainly be losses in agriculture. We cant say that the agricultural season has been wrecked but there will certainly be losses Temirgaliyev said. He said work was underway to draft a drip irrigation programme to save water. We hope it will be implemented by the next agricultural year he added. Restrictions on the supply of water to Crimea are an act of sabotage on the part of Ukraine Crimean Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov told the CrimeaInform news agency. Ukraines act of sabotage to limit the supply of water to the republic through the North Crimean Canal is nothing but a deliberate action against Crimeans he said. Aksyonov said negotiations are underway with Ukraine at the federal level to resolve the issue. There are backup plans. In any case Crimea will not be left without water. As for drinking water there are no problems with it he said. The prime minister said that the Crimean authorities were engaged in negotiations with all agricultural producers who have been cut off from water supply from the North Crimean Canal. The rice situation is the worst. Crimea is redrawing the map of crop areas in regions where irrigation may not be available he said adding that alternative areas were being offered to agricultural producers. The federal budget is ready to compensate agricultural producers for possible losses Aksyonov said. He recalled that this issue had been discussed with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak. Special conditions have been created for Crimea. No one will be left without help the prime minister said. We are also considering an alternative plan for drilling wells and we are working on this day and night he added. Aksyonov stressed that the persons who have seized power in Ukraine including former residents of Crimea Senchenko and Kunitsyn are acting like enemies trying to cause their former fellow citizens harm. But they will get a proper assessment from the people of Crimea and will always be persona non-grata in the republic. Usually those who mischief hatch mischief catch he said. According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85% of fresh water from this canal which was built in 1961-1971.

Palestinians' legitimate aspirations cant be fulfilled without consolidation - FM MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow welcomes practical steps to reset the process of Palestinian reconciliation the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. It described as important the visit to Gaza by a Palestinian delegation from the West Bank that began on April 22. The delegation led by a Fatah Central Committee member Azzam al-Ahmad met with HAMAS leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh. The two sides agreed to form a Palestinian technocratic government and hold general elections in keeping with the understanding reached earlier the ministry said. We regard this as a step in the right direction. Moscow has always adhered to the opinion that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people cannot be fulfilled and a fair and lasting settlement between Israel and Palestine on the well-known international legal basis cannot be achieved without the consolidation of Palestinian ranks on the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] and the Arab Peace Initiative platform the ministry said.

Shoigu and Secretary of Defense Hagel held a telephone conversation on Monday discussing the tense situation in Ukraine WASHINGTON April 29./ITAR-TASS/. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu gave reassurances to his US counterpart Chuck Hagel that Russia had no plans of bringing its troops to Ukraine a spokesman for Pentagon said. Shoigu and Secretary of Defense Hagel held a telephone conversation on Monday discussing the tense situation in Ukraine. Following the conversation Pentagon Press Secretary Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement that Shoigu "reiterated his assurance that Russian forces would not invade [Ukraine]." Kirby also said in the statement that Hagel "repeated his call for an end to Russia's destabilizing influence inside Ukraine and warned that continued aggression would further isolate Russia and result in more diplomatic and economic pressure." On Monday the United States introduced a third set of sanctions against Russia. The new US measures envisioned sanctions against seven Russian officials as well as 17 countrys companies. Canada and the European Union also announced new sanctions against Russia on Monday. Following the talks between Shoigu and Hagel the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the military officials had a frank one-hour conversation and exchanged concerns about tensions in Ukraine. Some western media allegations about Moscows intentions to invade Ukraine emerged after Russia launched military drills last week in the countrys regions bordering on Ukraine. Shoigu told Hagel that under the pretext of fighting terrorism the Kiev regime had amassed about 80 tanks over 130 armored personnel carriers and fighting vehicles at least 60 artillery systems and mortars in the southeast of Ukraine. Combat aircraft and helicopters are engaged on a regular basis. The overall number of Ukrainian troops has reached 15000 personnel and all this against the peaceful population of their own country the minister said. The possibility of forceful actions against peaceful people prompted Russia to launch large-scale maneuvers on the national territory in regions bordering on Ukraine. This decision was made public he said. However as soon as the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had no intention to use regular military units against unarmed people the Russian units were ordered back to their bases. Shoigu also flatly denied unfounded assertions about the presence of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in Ukraine where they are allegedly destabilizing the situation in southeastern regions of the country. The situation in Ukraine is far from stable after a coup in February which brought to power new people amid deadly riots as President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave the country citing security concerns. After Crimea's accession to Russia which Kiev and Western countries do not accept despite Russias repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law protests against the new Kiev leaders erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern regions. Demonstrators who are demanding referendums on the countrys federalization took control of some government buildings. Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim head of state Alexander Turchinov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region in eastern Ukraine apparently aimed to crack down on federalization supporters.

Crimean authorities begin to de-mothball water well in northeastern areas According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev authorities halted water supplies to Crimea via the North Crimean Canal SIMFEROPOL April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Crimeas authorities have launched works to de-mothball water well to replenish drinking water reserves after the Kiev authorities halted water supplies to Crimea via the North Crimean Canal Crimean Minister of Information Dmitry Polonsky told Itar-Tass on Sunday. According to Polonsky fresh water reserves were discovered in Crimea back in the 1970s when Soviet geologists drilled wells in Crimeas northeastern areas. But it was of no need back then he said. Today the situation has changed and we have to do it. So far we have no exact figures the work has just begun Polonsky noted. Earlier Crimeas Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev said that fresh water reserves in the Crimean northeast were enough to provide with drinking water Crimeas south eastern regions including Feodosia and Kerch. In his words works at water wells would be started next week. According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85% of fresh water from this canal which was built in 1961-1971. Crimeas official authorities reassure that the peninsula has enough drinking water whatever actions the current Ukrainian authorities might take although there may be some problems for farmers.

USA to announce further sanctions vs. Russia later on Monday According to Barack Obama they would be a response to Russia's failure to uphold an international accord aimed at stemming the crisis in Ukraine TOKYO April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. The US will announce a new package of sanctions against Russian individuals and companies in the course of the day US President Barack Obama stated in Manila where he is currently on an official visit. He added that the new sanctions are in response to Russia's failure to uphold an international accord aimed at stemming the crisis in Ukraine. Obama noted that the sanctions would be aimed at Russian citizens and companies. The sanctions would also affect the export of hi-tech commodities to Russia the American leader said. USA publishes sanctions list with several Russian and Ukrainian officials US State Department restricts sale of defense products to Russia EU has published a list of 21 sanctioned Russian and Crimean officials EU expands black list of Russians and cancels EU-Russia summit in June The USA imposed sanctions against Russia in response to its stance over Crimeas status. March 17 the USA announced a black list including 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials. In March and April the list has been expanded several times. To date the list includes several dozens of people who as US authorities believe undermine Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity. In addition the USA has suspended cooperation with Russia in the field of combating drug trafficking and in the space industry (except for the International Space Station project) and introduced restrictions for supplying military and double-purpose products to Russia. They should not treat Russia as a naughty schoolgirl who is being poked with a piece of paper on which she must tick off a report on her homework. It is impossible Seven leading industrialized states threatened Russia with further sanctions with regard to the situation around Ukraine. This says a G7 statement issued by the White House April 25. Governments of Canada France Germany Italy Japan Great Britain and USA as well as the European Union and the European Commission warned that they would not hesitate to impose additional sanctions against Russia. The authors of the statement believe that Russia is not taking any concrete steps to support the Geneva agreement and does not condemn separatists seeking to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. Moscow is also accused of holding threatening military drills near the Ukrainian border. The EU Council plans to adopt a regulation on expanding the black list for Russia until Monday evening. The list which includes so far 33 names may be completed by another 10-15 names of Russian officials and defense agencies representatives. All of them are banned entry to EU countries and possible assets on EU territory are frozen. Ambassadors of 28 members states of the EU also plan to discuss trade and economic sanctions against Russia. However as a diplomatic source told ITAR-TASS earlier there is no unity among the EU states on the appropriate economic measures against Russia nor is there any consensus on the necessity to introduce them. Representatives of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) which is in the ruling coalition believe that the possible introduction of further sanctions against Russia would not be an effective instrument in settling the Ukrainian crisis. Thus Deputy Head of SPD faction in the Bundestag Axel Schfer stated in an interview for Reinische Post newspaper that sanctions would hardly have any significance other than symbolic. Instead of this we should make even more diplomatic efforts and use every opportunity for dialogue with Russia the politician believes. A similar point of view expressed the SPD factions representative for military issues Reiner Arnold. I dont think that sanctions against specific people in Russia would have a positive effect on the overall situation (in Ukraine) he pointed out. The politician says that neither the increased NATO activity on eastern borders would yield any result. Schfer specified that federalization supporters in Ukraine are by no means impressed by military exercises of 500 NATO servicemen in Poland. German Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier who also represents SPD has repeatedly pointed earlier to the necessity to seek for diplomatic ways of resolving the crisis in Ukraine. In particular he called for holding round tables with participation of Kiev authorities and federalization supporters. In addition the minister believes that representatives of Russia USA EU and Ukraine should in a four-party format make joint trips to the countrys west and east to hold a direct dialogue with the parties of the conflict. German experts share the view that possible economic sanctions would have a negative impact primarily on German economy itself. Trade volume between Germany and Russia in 2013 amounted to 76 billion about 6000 Germany-based enterprises are making business with Russian companies and the total volume of their investments makes 20 billion.

Tokyo says would like to continue political dialogue with Moscow TOKYO April 30/ITAR-TASS/. Japan would like to continue political dialogue with the Russian Federation Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told Japanese journalists on Wednesday during his visit to Denmark. We would like to keep holding political dialogue with Russia in future Kishida said but refused to comment on the Russian Foreign Ministrys reaction to the imposition of new sanctions against Russia by Japan on Tuesday. The Japanese government yesterday announced additional sanctions against Russia over the situation around Ukraine where the situation is far from stable after a coup occurred in the country in February. The sanctions envision suspension of entry visa issuance to 23 Russian officials and other persons. The list is to be made public later. In response the Russian Foreign Ministry called Tokyos decision on sanctions counterproductive and pledged it will not be left without a response. Tokyos decision to impose visa sanctions on a number of Russian nationals was perceived in Moscow with disappointment and will certainly not be left without a response Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said in this connection. This clumsy step was apparently made under external pressure and goes out of line with Tokyos statements on the importance of development of the entire complex of relations with Russia Lukashevich said. Meanwhile Kishida today held phone talks with European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton during which the sides agreed to overwhelmingly support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) whose observers will monitor early presidential elections in Ukraine scheduled for May 25. Western countries have imposed targeted sanctions on some Russian and Crimean officials following Crimeas reunification with Russia in March. Moscow has also imposed some targeted sanctions in response. The West has already expanded its punitive measures against Russia since they were first imposed and has threatened Russia with new economic sanctions unless Moscow changes its foreign policy. Moscow has said the language of sanctions is counterproductive and will have a boomerang effect on Western nations. The Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol a city with a special status on the Crimean Peninsula where most residents are Russians struck agreements to reunify with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. The developments followed the coup in Ukraine in February when new people were propelled to power in the country amid deadly riots as President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns. Crimea refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities. Russia does not accept the new Ukrainian leaders who appear unable to restrain radicals and ultranationalists either. After Crimeas incorporation by Russia which Kiev and Western countries do not recognize despite Russias repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite conformed to the international law and the UN Charter and was in line with the precedent set by Kosovos secession from Serbia in 2008 protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern regions. Demonstrators who are demanding referendums on the countrys federalization took control of some government buildings. Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim head of state Alexander Turchinov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region in eastern Ukraine apparently designed to clamp down on federalization supporters. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday dismissed claims that Russia was involved in the latest pro-federalization protests in Ukraine. People say our special forces are present there [in Ukraine] say we have sent instructors there. Let me say in all responsibility that there are no Russian instructors special forces or troops of any kind there. We have no one there Putin said in the Belarusian capital Minsk where he went for integration talks with the leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan.

Donetsk mayor proposes to put off referendum on regions status to May 25 KIEV April 23./ITAR-TASS/. Mayor of Ukraines much-troubled eastern city of Donetsk Alexander Lukyanchenko has come up with a proposal to put off a referendum on the status of the region from May 11 to May 25 and to combine it with the presidential election. He said there would be no grounds for considering the plebiscite legitimate otherwise as the authorities in Kiev had not adopted the law on local referendums yet. Lukyanchenko said however that legislative duplicities could be avoided if the referendum were synchronized with the presidential election. It would then be held under the supervision of numerous international organizations and anyone would scarcely question its legitimacy then he said. In addition we could avoid unnecessary excessive costs then. To hold the referendum a total of 426 polling stations should be set up just the same number of electoral commissions Lukyanchenko said. Earlier he proposed to hold an all-Ukraine voting on a new Constitution simultaneously with the election of the president. Protesters in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions demand that local referendums be held May 11.

Water supply problem in Crimea to cost $247- 417 million - Kremlin aide The Ukrainian authorities reduced water supplies to Crimea last week alleging the peninsula owned Kiev a large sum for water Russias Crimea to repay $10 million debt to Ukrainian companies PETROZAVODSK April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. It will take 10-15 billion roubles ($247-417 million) to solve the problem of water supply to Crimea presidential aide Andrei Belousov said. Crimea can be independent in terms of water supply but it will cost 10-15 billion roubles ($247-417 million) he said on Monday April 28. One of the solutions would be supplying water from Russias southern Kuban region by building a pipeline. However Belousov said this would be an exotic option. Another solution would be drilling wells and using the existing water reservoirs. The Ukrainian authorities reduced water supplies to Crimea last week alleging the peninsula owned Kiev a large sum for water. However Crimean Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov said restrictions on the supply of water to Crimea were an act of sabotage on the part of Ukraine. Ukraines act of sabotage to limit the supply of water to the republic through the North Crimean Canal is nothing but a deliberate action against Crimeans he said. Aksyonov said negotiations are underway with Ukraine at the federal level to resolve the issue. There are backup plans. In any case Crimea will not be left without water. As for drinking water there are no problems with it he said. Russian government to provide subsidies for organizing transportation to/from Crimea The prime minister said that the Crimean authorities were engaged in negotiations with all agricultural producers who have been cut off from water supply from the North Crimean Canal. The rice situation is the worst. Crimea is redrawing the map of crop areas in regions where irrigation may not be available he said adding that alternative areas were being offered to agricultural producers. The federal budget is ready to compensate agricultural producers for possible losses Aksyonov said. He recalled that this issue had been discussed with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak. Special conditions have been created for Crimea. No one will be left without help the prime minister said. We are also considering an alternative plan for drilling wells and we are working on this day and night he added. Aksyonov stressed that the persons who have seized power in Ukraine including former residents of Crimea Senchenko and Kunitsyn are acting like enemies trying to cause their former fellow citizens harm. But they will get a proper assessment from the people of Crimea and will always be persona non-grata in the republic. Usually those who mischief hatch mischief catch he said. According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85% of fresh water from this canal which was built in 1961-1971. Crieman First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev said Kiev had no legal grounds for halting water supply. The Kiev junta has once again shown its real face he said. There is no and will be no shortage of drinking water in Crimea. But there will certainly be losses in agriculture. We cant say that the agricultural season has been wrecked but there will certainly be losses Temirgaliyev said. He said work was underway to draft a drip irrigation programme to save water. We hope it will be implemented by the next agricultural year he added.

There would be no shortage of food products in Russia Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov says KHABAROVSK April 25./ITAR-TASS/. Russian Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov said there were no politics behind possible decisions to ban some supplies to Russia from some or other countries. "It is usual. It is just presented as something extraordinary due to the politicization of the situation around Ukraine" he said commenting on the reports about a possible ban on supplies of fruit and vegetables from Poland. The minister noted that the federal service for veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance and the federal service for supervision of consumer rights protection and human welfare previously regularly imposed bans because of detection of some diseases or phytosanitary quarantine or other problems. Fyodorov also assured that there would be no shortage of food products in Russia. The Russian Agriculture Ministry rules out any possibility of shortages of some food products because of restrictions or sanctions he told reporters in reply to a question about consequences of possible restrictions on supplies to Russia from some countries. Practically always there are alternative countries and alternative regions that can promptly begin to supply needed products he said. Federal budget spending on Crime to stand at 130 billion rubles minister Rosneft investments in Far East to reach 79 billion rubles by 2015 Rosneft president Russia not to face shortage of any food products because of sanctions minister Ukraine Slovakia to sign deal on reverse gas supply April 28 In his words there are several countries that offer supplies. "They say we have heard about possible restrictions and we would like to be the first to supply products alternatively for example instead of Poland Lithuania or some other country" he noted. Besides a position of farmers in Western countries is far from always being the same as that of their governments. The United States is unwilling now to be a friend of Russia but US producers of poultry pork and beef ask for access to the Russian market the minister notes adding that the influence of farmers in the United States is rather strong. "There are more than six million voters only and with family members there are tens of millions of voters. It is a very influential force in Europe and the US. So we will work if not with the administrations (of the countries) then with farmers of France the Netherlands and Canada" he added. On the whole there can be some minor delays to substitute supplies but no noticeable shortages in stores because of political processes are expected for rather a long period the minister assures.

No logic in Wests readiness to recognize elections in Ukraine but not in Syria Lavrov Moscow will recognize only those results in Ukraine that are based on a comprehensive process Russia's minister of foreign affairs said MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was no logic in the Wests readiness to recognize elections in Ukraine without constitutional reform while refusing to do the same in Syria. US not ready to admit it cant run the show around globe Sergei Lavrov They [the United States] said and unfortunately this was picked up by the UN spokesperson that the elections in Syria called by President Assad for June 3 will be illegitimate because a transitional governing body should be created first on the basis of a new constitution and so on Lavrov said in an interview with the Russia Today television channel on Wednesday April 23. The Geneva communiqu says that a transitional governing body should be created [in Syria] which will develop the constitutional reform as the basis for general elections. The same sequence of actions was stated in the agreement on Ukraine of February 21: at first a government of national unity then constitutional reform and only then after a new constitution elections he said. The people who have come to power [in Ukraine] and declared themselves a government did not speak about constitutional reform at all in the beginning and said that presidential elections would be held on May 25. When we reminded them that constitutional reform was their obligation as well and that until they carry it out the east and the south would not recognize the legitimacy of what they were doing they remembered their obligation but said they would do it later Lavrov said. The West believes that all this is absolutely legitimate. Those who said that the Syrian presidential elections would not be legitimate without constitutional reform have already practically recognized the legitimacy of the elections in Ukraine slated for May 25 without constitutional reform the minister said. OSCE says seeing no signs of de-escalation in eastern Ukrainian regions Lavrov: Russian troops stay on own territory take no steps against obligations Right Sector still active despite Geneva deals Sergei Lavrov However Moscow will recognize only those results in Ukraine that are based on a comprehensive process he said. Announcing elections before a consensus is reached with the east and south of Ukraine would be destructive for the country. They [the authorities] must prove with actions and do what they promised to do. They said constitutional reform would be carried out and the status of the Russian language would be discussed as the south-east is demanding and they must start the process that will guarantee that all Ukrainian regions feel comfortable and know that they are heard and engaged in this process as equal parties Lavrov said. Once this process is over when the reform is ready it must be submitted to a referendum he said. It makes no difference what it is called federalization or decentralization the minister said recalling US Secretary of State John Kerrys remarks at a press conference in Geneva that Ukrainian regions would get autonomy. We want to be confident that the interests of the regions are taken into account that they decide their own fate within the state that respects their interests regarding the language culture history traditions heroes and their right to interact with their foreign neighbors Lavrov said noting that there were very many inter-regional ties between Russia and Ukraine. They [regions] want to elect their own leaders they want to keep more taxes for the development of their regions rather than give them all to Kiev and then wait for its handouts he said.

It would not be quite honest and wise to expect that problems Ukraine is facing could be settled through efforts of Russia or the Russian Gazprom company he said. Ukraines gas debt has already exceeded $2.2 billion. Russia has once again postponed switching to advance payments for gas which is envisaged in the contract between Gazprom and (Ukraines state energy company) Naftogaz Chizhov added. "We expect that consultations between Russia the European Commission and Ukraine will take place shortly to produce a solution to this complex and critical situation he said. Consultations were due on Thursday in Bratislava Slovakia where energy agency heads of the EU Ukraine and Slovakia were to meet on reverse gas supplies. Chizhov told ITAR-TASS however that the European Commission was not ready for consultations with Russia's participation.

Russia will insist on respect to the Geneva accord on Ukraine and will strongly denounce attempts to distort it Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a forum of young diplomats in the Russian capital on Friday. "We will insist on the fulfillment of the Geneva agreements and prevent attempts to distort them" Lavrov noted adding that there "should not be any unilateral demands but attempts were made to present them to us." To make claims to us that we have allegedly signed in Geneva something that delegitimises actions of current authorities is a lie the minister noted. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov plans to speak by telephone with US Secretary of State John Kerry later this Friday to discuss the situation in Ukraine. Addressing a forum of young diplomats on Friday the minister said he also planned to discuss with his US counterpart the fate of Pavel Guberev elected in Donetsk as "people's governor" and currently held in custody. The Foreign Ministry said earlier that telephone contacts between Lavrov and Kerry planned for April 23 and 24 did not take place for reasons beyond Moscow's control. Earlier US Secretary of State John Kerrys statement that Ukrainian law enforcers had allegedly seized several Russian security agents was "not serious talk" Sergei Lavrov said. Kerry has said many times that Ukrainian security services had captured several Russian security agents. So show them to people show them on television Lavrov added. What current Kiev authorities are doing today is a punitive action and a crime against their own people Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. The so-called Easter ceasefire was disrupted the foreign minister said noting that What Kiev authorities are doing today is just a punitive operation which already resulted in many victims. These are bloody crimes for which they will be held responsible". The West wants to take control of Ukraine being guided only by their geo-political ambitions he added. It is high time for Western partners to admit the truth that they do not have a monopoly for truth the minister noted adding that And this is unacceptable to make a certain picture of current events as the West want it to be. The West wants to take control of Ukraine guided only by their geo-political ambitions. Today it is impossible to conceal the truth. And attempts to do so lead to nothing good Lavrov said. If current Kiev authorities really begin to fulfil the Geneva accord take away Maidan protesters and disarm Ukrainian ultranationalists from Right Sector their opponents in south-eastern Ukraine will take reciprocal steps Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov believes Stop to violence should be a first step the minister noted. He noted that this meant an immediate stop to armys actions against their own people. East Ukraine tension mirrors lack of comfort OSCE head says Russia will do everything to defuse the tense situation in Ukraine Sergei Lavrov said. Those who are currently in power in Kiev are to blame for the escalation he noted. "Maidan" remains in Kiev and nobody intends to leave it he said. "Instead of car tyres concrete blocks are placed there now and nobody intends to disperse" the minister said. "Instead of disarming the Right Sector and other radicals Americans rebuke us. "If we want to talk about actions it should be remembered who started the escalation" Lavrov added. "Escalation was started by the current authorities in Kiev who carried out the coup dtat. Russia will not use ultimatums in seeking to achieve goals from events in Ukraine Lavrov said. Certainly we do not have such a heavy-handed discipline which exists in NATO and the European Union though there are some opinions there that are different from the common position the minister said adding that We prefer not to act through ultimatums within the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)...We are decent people after all. When a resolution on Ukraine was moved in the UN General Assembly Americans and Western Europeans primarily Americans sent their emissaries throughout the world. There was not a single country where they had not knocked at with a demand to support compulsorily this Ukrainian resolution. In fact this is not a resolution on Ukraine but an anti-Russian one Lavrov said. Kiev awaiting Moscows explanations for war games in area adjoining border Kremlin verifies information on scale of clashes in Ukraine Putin's spokesman Right Sector radicals seize local administration building in Ivano-Frankovsk region Abkhazia and South Ossetia were not planning to follow Crimea's example Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a forum of young CIS diplomats on Friday. When asked about it the minister said he had not heard there was such intention. "Abkhazia and South Ossetia are our partners and we will respect the way they have chosen" he said. Lavrov added he would meet with the Abkhazian and South Ossetian foreign ministers later on Friday.

Sanctions against Russia to affect French companies French commerce chief warns French business community finds it extremely important to maintain talks between the two countries in different formats amid particularly sharp deterioration of relations between Russia and the West PARIS April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. French business circles consider Russia as a priority partner and if France imposes economic sanctions against Moscow this will affect French companies in the same painful way President of the French-Russian Commerce and Industry Chamber Emmanuel Quidet said on Thursday. We are passing through quite hard times anxiety reigns in French business circles over current situation he said opening the annual Paris conference on French-Russian co-operation and world visions of the countries. French business community finds it extremely important to maintain talks between the two countries in different formats amid particularly sharp deterioration of relations between Russia and the West Quidet said. It would be a worst scenario to interrupt these talks now he noted. EU US companies try to persuade governments not to impose sanctions on Russia FT Sanctions against Russia to speed up integration with Asia Pacific Region speaker As for Russias importance for French business Quidet recalled France was among the three largest foreign investors in Russian economy now. More than 1.2 thousand French companies operate in Russia around six thousand companies are related in some way with export on Russian market he noted adding that This is a total of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Russia is a key trend for us and sanctions would be a catastrophe for both countries. Russian economy remains attractive for foreign investors even despite temporary difficulties and growth of foreign political tension amid current Ukrainian crisis the head of the French-Russian Commerce and Industry Chamber added. In fact some slowdown is observed but it will be temporary Quidet said. In general Russia has several undisputable advantages including a low level of state debt massive gold and foreign currency reserves and an extremely strong middle class that had not been affected in the recent economic crisis he said. Russian market is one of most attractive for France and the country cannot be absent there the French commerce chief executive said.

Implementation of a contract to supply Russian gas to Ukraine measures to ensure transit to Europe as well as the issue of payment by the Ukrainian side of the cost of supplied gas in the context of the financial and economic situation in that country will be discussed at the talks the Russian Energy Ministry said. Naftogaz of Ukraine refuses to recognise debt under take-or-pay contract According to Russias ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov the Russian side proposed holding such three-party consultations to discuss the critical situation in the Ukrainian energy sector on April 24 and then on April 28 but Brussels was not ready for them then. He said Moscow is set for deep discussions of the entire situation in the energy sphere. Prior to the three-sided meeting in Warsaw Oettinger will also meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Their talks will focus on the Poland-promoted initiative of a European energy union whose key aim is to reduce the European Unions dependence on Russian gas deliveries and to strengthen Europes positions in talks with Gazprom. According to the Polish head of government the EU is concerned about what will happen to gas that should pass via Ukraines territory to those who bought the gas in line with mid- and long-term contracts. Gas storage facilities in Ukraine are not full and everyone is already thinking about winter he said. In the conditions of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict Europe is considering how the gas will get to Europe despite the current situation. We dont have a fully alternative source [of gas supplies] yet. On Wednesday Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov told journalists that Ukraines overall debt for Russian gas grew to about $3.5 billion. Taking into account the request by [Ukraines national oil and gas company] Naftogaz Ukrainy for April 30 add the volumes that we have already supplied that month the overall debt of Ukraine for Russian gas preliminarily stands at $3.492 billion he said. As of April 26 Naftogaz imported some 2.25 billion cubic meters of Russian gas worth $1.09 billion. For the remaining days the requested import was 110 million cubic meters daily. So Ukraine was due to import in April 2.7 billion cu m of gas. By May 1 Naftogazs debt grows by $1.3 billion to about $3.5 billion with the gas price standing at $485.5 per 1000 cu m. Turchinov orders Naftogaz to secure Russian gas supplies at previous price The European Commission earlier said it is ready to help Ukraine pay off its gas debt. But Prodan has not yet expressed readiness to pay for gas supplied by Gazprom. On April 28 Ukrainian parliament-appointed prime minister Arseny Yatsenyuk reported that the government made the decision to start the procedure of suing Gazprom. He said Ukraine is ready to pay $268 per 1000 cu m of gas and if Russia gives a positive answer on the price and extends the contract Ukraine will without delay pay off its $2.2 billion debt to Gazprom. Ukraine is awaiting a reply from Gazprom for 30 days otherwise [the country] will sue [Gazprom] in Stockholm Yatsenyuk said. Also on April 28 Ukraine and Slovakia signed in Bratislava a memorandum of intent on organizing reverse supplies of gas to Ukraine. In line with the reached agreements from October supplies to Ukraine will total 3.2 billion cubic meters annually. In 2015 the volume may grow to 10 billion cu m. The sides also agreed that they will consider whether it will be possible to organize reverse supplies via the transit pipe via which the Russian gas is delivered to Europe. Meanwhile the gas reverse agreement with Slovakia will not allow Ukraine to stop purchasing Russian gas. Internal consumption of gas in Ukraine totals 50 billion cu m annually with its own production accounting for slightly less than a half. The deal with Slovakia envisions reverse deliveries of 3.2 billion cu m and a deal with Germanys RWE on reverse gas supplies from Poland stipulates deliveries of 1.5 billion cu m. Possible reverse deliveries from Hungary can reach 5 billion cu m. Thus Ukraine can only cover a third of its Russian gas imports due to supplies from Europe. Moscow recently substantially raised the price for gas supplied to Ukraine from the figure of $268.5 per 1000 cubic meters agreed last year when an association agreement with the EU was shelved in November 2013. In the second quarter of 2014 the price for Russian gas for Ukraine was set at $385.5 per 1000 cu m. Gazprom said earlier that the price rose from $268.5 due to the return to earlier contract agreements as Ukraine failed to fulfill its commitments under an additional agreement concluded in December 2013 which obliged the country to pay for supplied volumes of Russian gas in time. On April 2 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on denunciation of the Kharkov Accords with Ukraine which were struck in 2010 and stipulated that Russias lease of naval facilities in Crimea [then part of Ukraine] would be extended by 25 years beyond 2017 - until 2042. The Kharkov deals envisioned a discount of $100 per 1000 cu m on Russian gas for Kiev. Now that the accords have been denounced due to Crimeas accession to the Russian Federation the discount will no longer be applied raising the gas price by another $100 to $485.5 per 1000 cu m which is expected to make the economic situation in Ukraine even more complicated. Ukraine is in political and economic turmoil following a coup that occurred in the country in February after months of anti-government protests triggered by Kievs decision to suspend an association agreement with the EU in November 2013 to study the deal more thoroughly. New people were brought to power in Kiev amid deadly riots that involved radicals after President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns in February 2014. Russia does not recognize the new Ukrainian authorities who appear unable to restrain ultranationalists and radicals. Ukraines crisis soured further when the Republic of Crimea where most residents are Russians refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new self-proclaimed Ukrainian leadership. Crimea held a referendum March 16 in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and reunify with the Russian Federation. The accession deal with Moscow was signed two days later. Kiev and Western nations do not recognize Crimeas reunification with Russia despite Moscow's repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite conformed to the international law and the UN Charter and was in line with the precedent set by Kosovos secession from Serbia in 2008. Some Russian and Crimean officials and companies have been subjected to sanctions by Western nations after Crimeas incorporation by Russia. Russia has also taken some limited punitive actions in response. The West has threatened Russia with new economic penalties unless the country changes its foreign policy but Moscow has dismissed the unfriendly measures saying the language of sanctions is counterproductive and will have a boomerang effect on Western nations. After Crimeas accession to Russia protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern territories with demonstrators demanding referendums on the countrys federalization and taking control of some government buildings. Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim head of state Alexander Turchinov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region in eastern Ukraine. Russia has condemned the operation which is apparently aimed to crack down on federalization supporters.

I would like to ask you together with partners from Belarus and Kazakhstan to finalise it (a draft treaty) as quickly as possible the president said at a meeting with members of the government on Wednesday. Putin said the work done at Tuesdays meeting of the Eurasian Economic Council in Minsk on April 29 was productive. We removed all obstacles to the signing of the treaty albeit not without difficulty. We found compromises and only some technical issues remain to be worked out. I hope this will be done in the very near future Putin said at a meeting with government members on Wednesday April 30.

China not ready to buy more Russian gas above 38 bcm being discussed MOSCOW April 23./ITAR-TASS/. Russias Gazprom is ready to supply more gas to China than the two sides are discussing but the buyer is not prepared to purchase extra volumes Viktor Timoshilov who is in charge of the companys eastern projects said on Wednesday April 23. We are negotiating with China for the supply of 38 billion cubic metres of gas eastward even though we could supply more but the buyer is not prepared to confirm the purchase of larger volumes he said. The sides are negotiating supplies in the amount of 38 billion cubic metres even though previously a figure of 60 billion cubic metres was discussed. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said after a meeting with Zhou Jiping Chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) in early April that the next round of talks would be held at the end of the month. At the meeting the parties addressed the issues of arranging Russian pipeline gas supply to China. Miller and Zhou achieved considerable progress on a contract being hammered out to supply gas via the eastern route in accordance with the previously agreed Major Terms. At this round of talks we approved all the project-related technical matters. We advanced in our talks on the gas price. The parties agreed that the contract would come into force before the end of 2014 and that the next round of talks would take place in Moscow in late April Miller said summarising the meeting results. Gazprom may sign a contract for the supply of natural gas to China during President Vladimir Putins visit to Beijing in May of this year the company said in January after a meeting between Miller and Zhou. Both sides are interested in the successful completion of the talks and are determined to sign the contract as soon as possible it was proposed at the meeting that the contract should be ready for signing during the Russian presidents visit to China scheduled for May of this year the statement said. The parties noted that the negotiations were progressing as per schedule and the contract would enter into force in accordance with the previously agreed Major Terms until late 2014. In March 2013 the two companies signed a memorandum on pipeline gas supplies from Russia to China using the eastern route. Miller said back then that gas supplies to China could be prepaid. Given the cost of the gas transportation system to the Chinese border preliminarily appraised at 770 billion roubles an advance payment could be as big as 25 billion U.S. dollars. In June 2013 CNPC came up with new pricing proposals suggesting that the price of gas be pegged to the value of Henry Hub liquefied natural gas. But Gazprom said it was not ready to do that. The eastern route is an extension from the Sila Sibiri (The Force of Siberia) gas pipeline. The main parameters of supplies are: crossing point in Blagoveshchensk; volume of supply 38 billion cubic metres with a possible increase to 60 billion cubic metres; start of supply 2018. Over the past 10 years natural gas consumption in China has increased from 24 billion to 100 billion cubic metres a year. There are several possible routes for bringing gas to China. Gazprom insisted that Russian gas be initially supplied to China via the western route. China insisted that gas be initially supplied by the eastern route which it believes will reduce the cost of Russian gas supplies. At this point the cost of Russian gas deliveries including transportation is close to Chinas offer of 250 U.S. dollars per 1000 cubic metres. The western route is the Altai gas transportation system that will supply gas from Gazproms gas fields. The eastern route can deliver gas from fields in Eastern Siberia and Sakhalin. The agreement on strategic cooperation between Gazprom and CNPC was signed on October 14 2004. In June 2009 the governments of Russia and China signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation in the field of natural gas. CNPC is China's largest petroleum company wholly-owned by the state and is one of the world's leading integrated oil and gas production companies. In 2009 Gazprom and CNPC inked the Framework Agreement on the major terms and conditions of natural gas supply from Russia to China. The Agreement stipulates annual exports of up to 68 billion cubic meters of gas to the Chinese market. In 2010 the Extended Major Terms of natural gas supply from Russia to China were signed. In September 2013 Gazprom and CNPC inked the Agreement on the major terms and conditions of pipeline gas supply from Russia to China via the eastern route.

The situation in Ukraine is far from stable after a coup in February which brought to power new people amid deadly riots as President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave the country citing security concerns. After Crimea's accession to Russia which Kiev and Western countries do not accept despite Russias repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law protests against the new Kiev leaders erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking south-eastern regions.

In the view of Putin it is necessary once again to analyze what happens in reality MOSCOW May 01. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin is against quick introduction of electric power social consumption norms. The experiment should be conducted with utmost carefulness the Russian leader said at a meeting with trade union leaders. In the view of Putin it is necessary once again to analyze what happens in reality. And in reality unfortunately there is a hidden or even open rising of tariff rates the president said. Therefore he noted there should be no hurry with the expansion of the experiment. In September 2013 a pilot project on the introduction of the electricity social consumption norm for the population was launched in a number of Russian regions. A lower tariff rate is set within the limits of the social consumption norm. However if the consumer exceeds the limit then he should pay a higher price for the difference between the social norm and actual consumption.

Ukraines authorities must stop immediately the use of Army units for the suppression of protests in the east of the country Mykhailo Dobkin a candidate for the post of president in the May 25 election representing the Party of Regions said Thursday at a session of the Kharkiv Regional Council. Aggressive rhetoric is coming from the Kiev officials more and more often Dobkin said. They call some people patriots and dismiss others as a horde he said. Authorities claim that some Ukrainians have died for the countrys freedom while others have died for God only knows what. The most aggressive representatives of the Kiev government feel free to do whatever they wish to and thats why I believe weve been absolutely right to include an immediate renunciation of the use of Army units as an instrument to suppressing protests in the East into the list of our demands Dobkin said. Dobkin also called upon the opposition and the Kiev authorities to pass a memorandum on mutual understanding as soon as possible. Kiev authorities should make first step toward national reconciliation Lavrov Ukraine to hold early elections despite developments in eastern regions Ukrainian Party of Regions refuses to vote in parliament until demands met Speaking at a plenary session of the Kharkiv regional council Dobkin suggested putting the memorandum into parliamentarians appeal as to priority measures on decentralization a higher role of local governments a constitutional reform and stabilization of social and political situation in the country. We want that the authorities listen at last to the opposition and sign a memorandum on mutual understanding that will help de-escalate tension in the country the head of the Party of Regions faction in the Kharkov regional council said. Today this attempt failed once again. On technicalities what the government offers is a set of phrases and nothing concrete. What the opposition factions suggest has an absolutely clear message and proposals that can be put into practice he said. Compromises must be made. One can use force to drive people away from a seized city council but one cannot change peoples mind and make them like and respect the present authorities Dobkin said. The Kiev government launched an active phase of the punitive operation near the city of Slavyansk in the Donetsk region Thursday morning.

Moscow sent a note to the EU Mission at the WTO and notified the WTO Secretariat thereof GENEVA April 30 /ITAR-TASS/. Russia has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against the European Union over the Third Energy Package a Russian source close to the case told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday April 30. This procedure is provided for in the rules of the Organisation the source said adding that Russia sent a note to the EU Mission at the WTO and notified the WTO Secretariat thereof. The Russian Ministry of Economic Development said earlier it was planning to file such a lawsuit before the end of the first quarter of 2014. In late 2013 Russia filed a lawsuit against the EU over energy adjustments. Russias complaints about the Third Energy Package also remain in force. We do not remove this issue from the agenda. Its number two on the list. As regards the Third Energy Package we are planning to start an investigation within the WTO framework in the first quarter of 2014 Deputy Minister of Economic Development Alexei Likhachev said in December. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev earlier disagreed with Europe's position on the Third Energy Package as it calls for a revision of existing agreements. As for antimonopoly structures we are not against different procedures if they occur by law but we think the position on the Third Energy Package is wrong Medvedev said. Even if it pursues positive goals it has a significant impact on existing ties and means a rejection of current agreements Medvedev said adding that Russia thinks thought it was a violation. President Vladimir Putin said he was hopeful that a compromise on the EU Third Energy Package could be reached. I do hope very much that we will be able to find a solution to these complex problems and questions through dialogue of partners he said. At the same time he said it would be unacceptable if the provisions of the Third Energy Package were applied retroactively to affect current contracts between Gazprom and consumers. All kinds of unilateral decisions are made - the Third Energy Package and it gets applied retroactively in an absolutely unprecedented way which would seem unacceptable in the modern civilised world and yet this happens he said. According to Putin the Third Energy Package can cause damage. However European Commissions Directorate-General for Energy said that it was designed to ensure a higher degree of competition in the market as EU countries must not depend on any one source of energy supplies. It confirmed that the EU had no problems with Russian companies if they played by European rules and said that Russia should ratify the Energy Charter in order to reduce risks related to trade and investments in the energy sector. The sides are expected to reiterate their intention to develop mutually advantageous energy cooperation for creating an integrated energy complex in Europe while pressing for strict compliance with existing bilateral and multilateral contractual obligations Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said. According to the European Commission the Third Energy Package should promote competition in the EU energy market and push energy prices down in Europe. One of its most controversial provisions demands that all energy transit infrastructure be handed over to autonomous operators independent from energy generating and mineral producing companies. Russian Permanent Representative to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov said that the enforcement of this provision has basically led to nationalisation of pipelines in some East European countries. As for the WTO European Commissioner for Trade Karel De Gucht earlier accused Russia of failure to fulfill its obligations within the WTO. Among trade problems between Russia and the EU he named specifically increased duties on imported motor vehicles and a ban on the import to Russia of certain kinds of cattle from EU countries that do not meet Russia's overstated veterinary requirements. The European Unions Third Energy Package is a legislative package for an internal gas and electricity market in the European Union. Its purpose is to further open up the gas and electricity markets in the European Union. The package was proposed by the European Commission in September 2007 and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in July 2009. It entered into force on September 3 2009. Core elements of the third package include ownership unbundling which stipulates the separation of companies generation and sale operations from their transmission networks and the establishment of a National Regulatory Authority (NRA) for each member state and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators which provides a forum for NRAs to work together.

Presidential candidate: situation in Ukraine can be settled in 2 days MOSCOW April 26//ITAR-TASS/. The crisis in Ukraine can be settled in a matter of two days presidential candidate and MP Oleg Tsarev said on Saturday April 26. The country can be saved and a war avoided. Its easy to do. It can be done in two days. The government simply needs to begin negotiations with us Tsarev told the Russian TVC television channels Pravo Znat (The Right to Know) programme to be aired on Saturday evening. The main point is to stop the war that is advancing on Ukraine he said. At the same time he believes that the [incumbent] authorities are showing no willingness to implement the Geneva agreement. The authorities are continuing arrests and repressions. The troops are surrounding small towns in the east. And I am seriously concerned that a mop-up [operation] will begin and blood will be spilled. This will forever separate the Southeast from Ukraine Tsarev said. In this situation one can only pin hopes on people. Ukrainians do not want to kill each other. All hopes are pinned on the people. They are sabotaging the war he said. Tsarev said assertions alleging that Russia is playing a role in the situation in the southeast of Ukraine were wrong. I personally know the people who are participating in the protest movement. I can see neither Russian money nor Russian aid nor Russian security services involved there he said. Early presidential elections in Ukraine are slated for May 25. Twenty-three candidates have qualified to compete for the presidency. Nine of them were nominated by political parties. Tsarev is an independent candidate a former member of the Party of Regions who offered on April 19 to mediate in the resolution of the crisis in the Southeast of Ukraine. He advocates cooperation with Russia official status for the Russian language and common history of the two countries.

US planning new sanctions against Russia says White House aide WASHINGTON April 27./ITAR-TASS/. U.S. is about to introduce new sanctions to punish Russia and in particular to target a range of individuals and corporations as well as the Russian defense industry U.S. deputy national security advisor Tony Blinken said Sunday on a CBS program. Russias punishment is pursuant to its alleged failure to de-escalate the situation in Ukraines breadwinning eastern regions where the protesters from among the mostly Russian-speaking population whom Washington invariably labels as pro-Russian separatists are demanding a referendum on the future status of the area and the transformation of the country into a federation. "We're going to save a little news for Monday but what I can tell you is this" Blinken said. "We will be looking to designate people who are in his (Russian President Vladimir Putins - Itar-Tass) inner circle who have a significant impact on the Russian economy he said. We'll be looking to designate companies that they and other inner circle people control. We'll be looking at taking steps as well with regard to high-technology exports to their (Russian) defense industry Blinken indicated. All of this together is going to have an impact. Blinken claimed that the sanction introduced by Washington and Brussels after the mid-March referendum in Crimea on reunification with Russia had had a tarnishing effect on the Russian economy. "We've already seen a significant impact of the pressure we've exerted on Russia over the last several weeks he said adding specifically that the Russian financial markets were down 22% since the beginning of the year and the ruble is at the lowest level ever". Vladimir Putin said during a major annual question-time televised show April 17 that the West might be seeking to turn him into a major object of sanctions. Quite possibly theyre making an attempt of this kind. When he was asked about Western sanctions against businessmen Gennady Timchenko Arkady Rotenberg and Boris Rotenberg he said: They are good acquaintances of mine actually friends and they earned their capitals before we got to know each other. For instance Mr. Timchenko has been engaged in business since the beginning of the 1990s Putin said. Speaking seriously they just dont have anything to do with the events in Crimea. He said they had learned about the Crimean events from TV reports like most people in Russia. But they listened to the reports from there literally with tears welling in their eyes and if thats the reason for punishing them then they really have something to be punished for. Putin added in this connection that he had no shame for his friends conduct.

Canada imposes sanctions on two Russian companies and nine individuals OTTAWA April 29./ITAR-TASS/. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper decreed on Monday to introduce a set of sc in regard to nine Russian individuals and two banks explaining the decision by Russias stance on the Ukrainian crisis. "Our government has been very clear that any further intimidation or actions to de-stabilize the Ukrainian government will result in consequences" the premier said in a statement. USA publishes sanctions list with several Russian and Ukrainian officials US State Department restricts sale of defense products to Russia EU has published a list of 21 sanctioned Russian and Crimean officials EU expands black list of Russians and cancels EU-Russia summit in June Switzerland imposes restrictions on financial transactions for 33 Russian officials Until Russia clearly demonstrates its respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity Canada will continue to work with its allies and like-minded countries to apply pressure that will further isolate Russia economically and politically Harper added. The sanctions envisage travel bans for nine Russian nationals who are Oleg Belaventsev the Russian presidential envoy to the Crimean Federal District Vyacheslav Volodin the first deputy head of the Russian presidential administration Dmitry Kozak a deputy prime minister Yevgeny Murov the head of the Federal Protective Service Alexei Pushkov a lawmaker Alexander Babakov a lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky a lawmaker Arkady and Boris Rotenberg who are both businessmen. The sanctions were also imposed on two Russian banks namely ExpoBank and RosEnergoBank but the nature of sanctions was not clarified in the statement. Harpers statement followed the United States introduction of a third set of sanctions against Russia on Monday. The new US measures envisioned sanctions against seven Russian officials as well as 17 countrys companies. The United States imposed sanctions against Russia in response to its stance over Crimeas status. On March 17 Washington announced a black list including 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials. In March and April the list has been expanded several times. To date the list includes several dozens of people who as US authorities believe undermine Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity. In addition the United States has suspended cooperation with Russia in the field of combating drug trafficking and in the space industry (except for the International Space Station project) and introduced restrictions for supplying military and double-purpose products to Russia. The situation in Ukraine is far from stable after a coup in February which brought to power new people amid deadly riots as President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave the country citing security concerns. Crimea where most residents are Russians refused to recognize the new self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities. Crimeans overwhelmingly voted in a referendum on March 16 to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. The reunification deal with Moscow was signed on March 18. After Crimea's accession to Russia which Kiev and Western countries do not accept despite Russias repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law protests against the new Kiev leaders erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking south-eastern regions. Demonstrators who are demanding referendums on the countrys federalization took control of some government buildings.

KIEV April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry alleged that the "presence of army units in the east of the country is solely aimed at the protection of citizens." In a press release on Wednesday the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said it believed "Russia should immediately move away" its troops from the border with Ukraine. Meanwhile Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with the RT news channel on Wednesday that "we never denied that we moved additional troops on the border just like Ukrainian authorities moved their troops closer to the Russian border because they moved them to the east and south regions. He also stressed that Russia had been conducting military exercises in different regions of the country on a regular basis since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister. The only thing I would like to highlight at this stage is that the Russian troops are on the Russian territory the requests for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document 2011 and under the treaty of the Open Sky they all have been granted he said. The inspectors visited the areas of deployment of the troops participating in the training exercises No one who participated in the inspections including the Americans Ukrainians and Europeans ever brought up any fact which would indicate that Russia was engaged in some dangerous military activity Lavrov said. "We are on our territory" Lavrov said underlining that Russia was not engaged in any military activity that did not fall under international law. "Ukrainian troops are also on the territory of their country but the difference is that they have an order allowing to use weapons against civilians. It's a criminal order" he said.

Military observers from some of the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe) countries who have been captured by police in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk will not be released any time soon the citys peoples mayor Vyacheslav Ponomarev told Bild Online on Wednesday April 30. OSCE representatives will make one more visit today and we will hold further talks he said. We are engaged in a dialogue but I do not think the release will take place today or tomorrow. Ponomarev also said that the Russian leadership was not exerting any pressure in this situation. The European military observers detained by police in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk were not who they claimed to be and reported a false purpose of the visit Ponomarev said earlier. The detainees said they have come on a sightseeing tour but had a map marking the polices positions he said. When they asked about the purpose of their visit they said they had come for a sightseeing tour. In other words they gave false information from the very beginning Ponomarev said adding that they had a map indicating the polices positions. Let me tell you that the map alone would be enough to speak about spying he said. The military were on our territory without our permission and were detained of course he said. What we should do with them we will know after we have determined who they are and what brought them here Ponomarev said adding that the detainees were being held in normal conditions. One of the military officials has diabetes but we have necessary medications and food (for him). Ponomarev said the supporters of federalisation were ready to exchange the detained military for their comrades being held by the Kiev authorities. The Kiev junta is holding our comrades. But we are ready for an exchange if there is such a chance he said. Yevgeny Gorbik a spokesperson for the supporters of federalisation told reporters that the detained military observers had been engaged in intelligence activities. The humanitarian group of the (OSCE) mission has denied any relation to them They (observers) had intelligence agents cryptograms and notebooks with secret notes Gorbik said. A Bulgarian officer had a notebook with notes in Russian which confirm his intelligence activities and speak of a meeting with agents he added. No charges have been brought against them so far. But theyve ended up in a company that calls into question the legitimacy of their activities Gorbik said adding The investigation is underway to find out what they were doing and where.

KIEV April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine's radical nationalist group Right Sector has begun to form special battalion 'Donbass' in the Donetsk region Right Sector leader Dmitry Yarosh said on Wednesday. "We're coordinating all our actions with the leadership of Ukraine's Council of National Security and Defence the Interior Ministry and the Security Service" said Yarosh. The special unit will include activists and trained fighters of Right Sector to assist secret services. He underlined that Right Sector activists and fighters were ready to help secret services. According to Yarosh he has no fears that Right Sector's participation in the special operation in the east of the country might provoke clashes with Donbass population. Earlier on Wednesday Yarosh said Sector had moved its headquarters from Kiev to Dnepropetrovsk. "It's easier to monitor the situation in Donbass from Dnepropetrovsk" he said. Local media reported a meeting in camera between Yarosh and head of the Dnepropetrovsk regional administration Igor Kolomoisky. The Right Sector leader denied receiving funding from oligarchs. "We're not using oligarchs' money in politics but when a war is on we do not object to their funding the army" he said. On Wednesday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Right Sector despite the Geneva accords remained quite active. "We agreed in Geneva that any violence should be stopped" the diplomat said. "But the next day  acting President/ Turchinov ordered the army to shoot at unarmed people participating in peaceful protests. In Geneva we also agreed that extremists should be disarmed but Right Sector is still active." In Russia the Investigative Committee opened a criminal case against Yarosh on charges of public calls for terrorist and extremist activities which he had made through mass media. Yarosh was put on the international wanted list. Moscow's Basmanny court sanctioned his arrest in absentia.

MOSCOW May 01./ITAR-TASS/. Kievs plans to conduct some national poll on May 25 are a phoney act the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday May 1. We have noted the remarks made by acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Arseny Yatsenyuk who said that some national poll should be held on May 25 which will concern particularly decentralisation of power. He also said that the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine had approved its own vision for the regional reform and separately stated that the government of the country is prepared to give additional guarantees to the Russian-speaking population and the languages of other ethnic minorities in the relevant territory. He did not specify what additional guarantees meanthe ministry said. The Kiev authorities plans detached from real life cause nothing but surprise in Moscow it said. Does Kiev really think that in the remaining days until May 25 2014 it can conduct a serious discussion in society and all regions of Ukraine on critical issues concerning the future state system in the country? These statements appear to be especially cynical against amid Kievs ongoing army operation against its own people the ministry said. Instead of starting a national discussion with all political forces and all regions in the country on how to resolve the deepest political and socioeconomic crisis the Kiev authorities are busy organising phoney actions.

VimpelCom delays filing of Annual Report to SEC due to Uzbekistan probe MOSCOW May 01./ITAR-TASS/. The telecom company VimpelCom has notified the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it has been unable to file its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31 2013 before the filing deadline. As the reason the company said it had not finalised its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting due in part to issues arising out of the investigations by the SEC the United States Department of Justice and the Dutch public prosecutors office and internal investigations. When the company completes that assessment its auditor Ernst and Young Accountants LLP will complete its review of the companys assessment and complete its related audit procedures it said in a statement released on Thursday May 1. In the middle of March 2014 the SEC and the Dutch public prosecutors office initiated an investigation into the companys activities. VimpelCom said back then that no concrete claims had been put forth but its documents had been seized. It said complaints were related to its operations in Uzbekistan. A similar investigation was started by the Uzbek authorities in late October 2013. It continued for two and a half months but revealed no violations. It was reported last autumn that Unitel (Uzbek subsidiary of VimpelCom) had encountered problems when getting permits for commissioning base stations and acquiring numbering capacity. VimpelCom bought Unitel in 2006 for 260 million U.S. dollars from Bakri Uzbekistan Telecom.

Russia had never said it had already refused to accept the poll results Russian lawmaker says Russian delegation not to participate in June PACE session - Russian lawmaker MOSCOW April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Kiev authorities' behaviour towards candidates they oppose reinforces doubt about the forthcoming presidential election head of the foreign affairs committee in Russias State Duma lower house of parliament Alexei Pushkov told a news briefing on Thursday. Russia had never said it had already refused to accept the poll results. But it had strong doubts about whether the election scheduled for May 25 could be considered open legitimate and democratic Pushkov said. The actions that Kiev radicals take regarding all the other undesired candidates strengthen these doubts he added. Key to events was the attitude of Ukrainians who were against the current government. If those who stand against Kiev's authorities ignore the forthcoming election it will be very difficult for Russia to accept the poll results as correct and democratic Pushkov said. East Ukraine tension mirrors mistrust of Kiev leaders OSCE head says Shoigu: 11000 servicemen involved in operation against civilians in Ukraines southeast Ukraine to hold early elections despite developments in eastern regions A total of 23 people were registered by Ukraines Central Election Commission to run for the countrys presidency.

EU ambassadors to continue work on sanctions against Russia next week The issue of a third phase of sanctions will be put up for discussion at a session of EU Foreign Ministers who are due to get together in Brussels May 12 BRUSSELS May 01. /ITAR-TASS/. Ambassadors of the 28 member-states of the EU are expected to continue work on the sanctions next week an official at the press service of the EU Council told ITAR-TASS. USA publishes sanctions list with several Russian and Ukrainian officials US State Department restricts sale of defense products to Russia EU has published a list of 21 sanctioned Russian and Crimean officials EU expands black list of Russians and cancels EU-Russia summit in June Switzerland imposes restrictions on financial transactions for 33 Russian officials In the light of the events unfolding in Ukraine representatives of the EU nations exchanged opinions on what sanctions could be applied in this situation in the future and this work will continue next week too. In the meantime a diplomat accredited with a mission of an East-European country told ITAR-TASSthe EU members have not ironed out disagreements on a further expansion of sanctions against Russia. A number of member-states have apprehensions regarding the reversibility of financial economic sanctions against Russia should any such sanctions be endorsed the diplomat said commenting on a conference of EU ambassadors in Brussels around the situation in Ukraine. The diplomat said the issue of a third phase of sanctions (financial and economic ones targeting whole sectors of Russian economy) will be put up for discussion at a session of EU Foreign Ministers who are due to get together in Brussels May 12. The diplomat did not rule out the EU would expand the list of Russian officials who would be subjected to punitive restrains in the form of travel visa bans and freezing of assets on the territories of the member states. Diplomatic sources in Brussels indicate that Austria Bulgaria Cyprus Greece Hungary Luxembourg Malta Portugal and Spain raise objections against the application of financial and economic sanctions to Russia. April 28 the EU Council endorsed a prolongation of the list of Russian individuals who are denied entry of EU countries and who may face a freezing of their assets at Western banks should any such deposits be tracked down there. The newly added group includes ten Russian citizens and five leaders of antifascist resistance forces in Eastern Ukraine. Thus the number of individuals affected by the EU sanctions to-date stands at 58 Brussels claimed Moscow had not taken enough practical steps under the April 17 Geneva accords on defusing the crisis in Ukraine. EU also accused Moscow of an escalation of tensions on the Ukrainian territory although it did not cite any proofs of Russias wielding influence on the moods and actions of the protesting population in the southeast of Ukraine.

Russia refrains from attending OSCE Permanent Council meeting on Ukraine Russia sees no point in explaining for the second time in one day its military activity near the Ukrainian border VIENNA April 30 /ITAR-TASS/. The Russian delegation did not attend a special meeting of the OSCE Forum for Security Cooperation and the OSCE Permanent Council convened on Wednesday April 30 over Russian military activities near the Ukrainian border. Russia sees no point in explaining for the second time in one day its military activity near the Ukrainian border Andrei Kelin Russias Permanent Representative to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said. We see no point in doing this because I said this morning at a meeting of the Permanent Council that military exercises had been held but as soon as the Kiev authorities said that they would not use the Armed Forces against the people the Russian units were withdrawn to their permanent bases away from the Russian-Ukrainian border Kelin said. This is the third senseless attempt to convene this extraordinary mechanism which is provided for in Section 3 of the Vienna Document. The purpose of doing this is to create the atmosphere of extraordinariness and justify the inaction and incompetence of the Kiev authorities the diplomat said. They cannot control the situation in the east of the country without starting a dialogue and as protests there are gaining momentum it will be increasingly difficult to come to agreement on constitutional reform the status of the language and other issues. U.S. Permanent Representative to the OSCE Daniel Baer was so much displeased with the absence of the Russian envoy that he Twitted pictures of his empty seat from two angles having obviously had to walk around the room to take them. On April 24 Kiev sent an official inquiry to the OSCE following Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigus statement that battalion-level tactical groups of the Southern and Western Military Districts had started exercises in regions bordering on Ukraine. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that in reply to Kievs inquiry Moscow had failed to provide exhaustive explanations regarding the purpose and place of military manoeuvres held in the Southern and Western Military Districts over the past several days near the Ukrainian border the date of their completion and the number and type of military units involved. Given the insufficient information received Ukraine has suggested to the Russian Federation that consultations be held in Vienna on April 28 as provided for in the abovementioned document in order to discuss this issue. Other states that have voiced concern about Russias military activities near the Ukrainian border have also been invited to take part in the consultations the Foreign Ministry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the Russia Today television channel this week that Russian troops were staying on their own territory and were not taking any steps that would go against their obligations. We have never denied the fact that we sent additional troops to the border [with Ukraine] just as the Ukrainian government redeployed its troops closer to our border. Our troops are conducting exercises on the territory of our own country. Such exercises are conducted regularly since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister Lavrov said. Exercises are held in different parts of Russia. As far as I know the next exercises will be held in the north-west of the country. This is a continuous process. The army must be in good shape and ready to act while hoping that it will not have to interfere the minister said. However if we are attacked we will respond by all means. If our legitimate interests and the interests of Russian people are directly affected as was the case in South Ossetia I see no way to respond other than doping so in full compliance with international law. Those who threaten the security of Russian citizens jeopardise the security of the whole country Lavrov said. He stressed the fact that Russian troops were staying on the territory of Russia. Demands for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document of 2011 and the Treaty on Open Skies were satisfied. Inspectors from the United States the European Union and Ukraine visited Russian troops bases and could not cite even one fact that would signify dangerous military activities on the part of Russia the minister said. We are on our own territory and are not taking any actions that would go against our obligations he said. Ukrainian troops are also staying on their territory but the difference is that they have an order allowing them to use weapons against peaceful citizens. This is a criminal order.

BRATISLAVA April 28./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine is ready to pay its debt to Russias Gazprom for gas supplies at a price of 268.5 U.S. dollars per 1000 cubic metres acting Energy and Coal Industry Minister Yuri Prodan said. Ukraine is ready to pay the debt. But we cannot pay the price Gazprom set from April 1. It is unjustifiably high and is about 500 U.S. dollars. We are ready to pay under our obligations the minister said on Monday April 28. He said that the Ukrainian gas transit system would be incorporated into the European gas transportation system. We can also use the possibilities of our underground gas storage facilities and hope that European gas companies will build up their reserves in our storage facilities he said. Ukraine and Slovakia signed a memorandum of intent in Bratislava earlier in the day agreeing to organise reverse-flow gas supplies to Ukraine. A source familiar with the situation told ITAR-TASS that the amount of gas supplied in reverse mode might increase to 10 billion cubic metres. The two countries also agreed to explore the possibility of reverse-flow supplies by the transit pipeline used by Gazprom to deliver gas to Europe. According to Prodan reverse-flow supplies can reach 8 billion cubic metres by September 1 2014 not by 2015. Gas will be supplied by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline not the transit pipeline. EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said such supplies would not require the Russian companys agreement and would give Ukraine up to 10 billion cubic metres of a gas a year but stressed that reverse-flow gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine by the trunk pipeline would be impossible without Gazproms consent as it would run counter to the Slovak company Eustreams contractual obligations. Oettinger believes that diversification of supplies will help to solve Ukraines gas problem in part. However reverse-flow supplies from Poland and Hungary by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline will not be enough for Ukraine get through the coming winter comfortably. He also said that the European Union was providing support to Kiev on the repayment of its gas debt to Russia. Meanwhile Naftogaz of Ukraine is planning to transport gas from Poland under a contract with Germanys RWE until the end of April and throughout May. According to the declared volumes Naftogaz of Ukraine is to get 4.022 million cubic metres of gas from Poland on April 15-22; 4.08 million cubic metres a day on April 23-30 and 4.022 million cubic metres on May 1-31. Up to date Ukraine was supposed to receive about 40 million cubic meters of gas from Poland. RWE AG resumed gas supplies to Ukraine through its division RWE Supply and Trading on April 15 under a five-year framework agreement with Naftogaz of Ukraine signed in May 2012. RWE supplies to Ukraine are based on the European pricing principles including transportation costs. The agreement provides for the delivery of up to 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year Naftogaz of Ukraine said. In 2013 RWE supplied about 1 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine. The maximum amount of gas Ukraine can get from Poland is 4 million cubic metres a day. However RWE has reiterated its readiness to increase gas supply to Ukraine as soon as transportation restrictions are lifted on the Slovak-Ukrainian border Naftogaz of Ukraine said. The European Union has promised assistance to Ukraine in diversifying natural gas supplies. Kiev is planning to buy about 290 million cubic metres of gas in Europe in reverse mode (about 140 million cubic metres will be delivered through Poland and the rest through Hungary). Ukraine has been receiving natural in reverse flows from Europe since November 1 2012. The gas is supplied across the Ukrainian border with Poland under a contract with from German RWE. The gas is supplied across the Ukrainian border with Poland. RWE planned to supply up to 5 billion cubic metres of gas to Ukraine until May 2013. Last year Naftogaz Ukrainy imported 55 million cubic metres of gas using the reverse flow scheme. The throughput capacity of the Ukrainian gas transportation is 288 billion cubic metres system at the entrance and 178.5 billion cubic meters at the exit including 142.5 billion cubic metres to European countries and 3.5 billion cubic metres to Moldova. Natural gas transit through Ukraine to Europe and CIS countries in 2011 increased by 5.7% from 2010 to 104197067000 cubic metres including to Western Europe by 5.9% to 101098013000 cubic metres but decreased by 2.4% to 3099054000 cubic metres to CIS countries. Ukraines gas transportation system consists of 72 compressor stations 110 production shops and 1451 gas distribution stations. The overall length of gas pipelines operated by the company is 38600 kilometres including 22200 kilometres of trunk pipelines and 16400 kilometres of extensions. Ukraine consumes over 50 billion cubic metres of gas annually.

Western sanctions against Russia not to affect rouble economy - Kremlin aide The stronger the sanctions are the tighter the elite will become. This is the main effect from the sanctions presidential aide Andrei Belousov PETROZAVODSK April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. New Western sanctions against Russia will have no negative impact on the rouble or economic growth presidential aide Andrei Belousov said. They (sanctions) are insignificant. There may be some short-lived effects but they are unlikely to have any serious annual impact Belousov said on Monday April 28. He believes that the new sanctions announced by the European Union and the United States earlier in the day will only consolidate the Russian elite. The stronger the sanctions are the tighter the elite will become. This is the main effect from the sanctions he said. In his opinion the mentality of Russian people is such that the stronger the external factors the more likely internal consolidation in the country. I think the sanctions will produce an effect: they will mobilise us even more. What our colleagues do not understand is that these sanctions have led to the tightest consolidation of the elite over the past 10-15 years the aide said.

By making this decision the United States was guided by absolutely distorted and unfounded perceptions regarding the events in Ukraine and around it Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov says MOSCOW April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. The unilateral sanctions against Russia imposed by the United States are illegitimate and run counter to the rules of civilised communication Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. We strongly condemn the announced set of measures aimed at trying to put pressure on Russia by means of sanctions. Unilateral exterritorial sanctions are illegitimate in nature. Not only do they not conform to the norms of civilised interstate communication and the practice of international relations but they also run counter to international law the diplomat told ITAR-TASS on Monday April 28. By making this decision the United States was guided by absolutely distorted and unfounded perceptions regarding the events in Ukraine and around it. Washington is pouring oil on the flames but has done nothing has not taken even one step to bring its proteges in Kiev to their senses. The new attempt at diktat and ultimatum undertaken by America against us will add no chance for a constructive resolution of the problems. The demands the protesters are putting forth in the eastern regions of Ukraine are absolutely legitimate. Instead of exerting pressure and making attempts to impose certain solutions the United States should get preoccupied with more intensive and substantive work with its clients in Kiev in order to normalise the situation Ryabkov said. USA publishes sanctions list with several Russian and Ukrainian officials US State Department restricts sale of defense products to Russia EU has published a list of 21 sanctioned Russian and Crimean officials EU expands black list of Russians and cancels EU-Russia summit in June Unfortunately we have to talk not only about sanctions against certain Russian individuals and companies but also about the revival of the seemingly bygone practice of restrictions on normal high-tech cooperation. Washington is basically restoring COCOM the Cold War-era method of limiting normal cooperation thus driving itself into the darkest and dustiest corner of the past epoch. This is not a 21st century policy. This is a reflection of the fact that people remain trapped by their own phantoms and perceptions and probably nostalgia for the long-gone world the diplomat said. Once again we can see that these steps are being taken by those who determine the Russian policy in the United States out of their own helplessness. They will certainly not achieve the goals they are seeking. The situation will deteriorate. We will respond and this will not be our choice. But we cannot leave this without reaction practical reaction based on our own decisions. The US behavior is becoming challenging in this respect Ryabkov said.

MOSCOW April 28./ITAR-TASS/. Bahrain has no plans to buy Russias SuperJet-100 passenger liner (SSJ-100) Transport Minister Kamal bin Ahmed said on Monday April 28. In 2013 at the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget the SSJ-100 maker Sukhoi Civil Aircraft and the Bahrain leasing company AeroLease signed a letter of intent to finance and/or lease current or future SSJ-100 acquisitions. AeroLease CEO Masood al-Bastaki told reporters back then that the company was planning to buy 4-5 planes at the initial stage to test the market. Sukhoi Civil Aircraft hoped to sign a firm contract before the end of 2013 however no further information on cooperation between the two companies followed. In January 2013 Bahrain Air showed interest in the Russian plane. Its executive director said back then that the company was considering buying 3-5 planes but was choosing between Sukhoi SuperJet-100 and Bombardier. He said the company would make up its mind by the end of the first quarter of 2012. However Bahrain Air was liquidated in February 2013. Bombardier has an impressive share of the Middle East market. Regional companies use more than 200 Bombardier planes and the company says it will supply up to 1000 aircraft in the next twenty years. Sukhoi SuperJet-100 is a regional 100-seat plane designed and made by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in cooperation with Alenia Aermacchi. Its basic version can fly for a distance of up to 3048 kilometres. An increased range is 4578 kilometres. The company plans to start making a long-range version of the plane from 2013 and to offer a business version of the plane in 2015. It may be of interest to Middle East countries. Sukhoi hopes to sell 800 aircraft until the year 2024 while the global demand for the aircraft of this class totals 5400. The SuperJet the first new Russian passenger plane over the past 20 years is being created through unprecedentedly broad international cooperation that involves more than 30 major international aerospace companies system and component suppliers. Sukhoi SuperJet-100 integrates the world's best industry practices and solutions. Sukhoi SuperJet-100 integrates the world's best industry practices and solutions. All aircraft will be certified in accordance with both Russian and international requirements. SSJ100's technical and operational performance make the product fully marketable and capable of taking a solid share in the highly competitive global market. Thus Sukhoi expects to sell 800 aircraft until the year 2024 while the global demand for the aircraft of this class totals 5400. So far the company had secured 73 solid orders for the aircraft. SuperJet-100 will in the future provide the basis for a whole family of planes including transport and special purpose planes. However now the main goal is the certification of the plane and serial production of 60-70 planes annually. The Sukhoi SuperJet-100 family consists of two types of aircraft of basic and increased flying ranges with the carrying capacity of 75 and 95 passengers respectively.

New EU sanctions show Brussels' misinterpretation of Ukraine situation Russia's FM MOSCOW April 29. /ITAR-TASS/. Imposition of EU sanctions on Russia shows Brussels full misinterpretation of the current situation in Ukraine the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. If someone in Brussels hopes to stabilize the situation in Ukraine this way this is an obvious evidence of full misinterpretation of domestic political situation in that country and direct invitation to local neo-Nazis to continue their outrage and lynchcivilians in south-eastern Ukraine the ministry said. A new portion of sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian citizens announcedby the European Union cannot but cause repulsion the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. "A new installment of sanctions imposed by the EU on Russian and Ukrainian citizens cannot but cause repulsion" the ministry's commentary said.

German politician says dispatching of Germany military observers to Ukraine silly action BERLIN April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Germanys government did a silly and highly unprofessional thing as it sent a group of Bundeswehr experts to Ukraine upon an arrangement with the Kiev authorities Alexander Neu a deputy of Bundestag representing the Left Party said Sunday at a meeting of the parliamentary committee on defense. He believes an agreement on a verification operation or on the sending of military specialists to the east of Ukraine that was reached by Berlin and Kiev is doing an obvious disservice to the properly diplomatic observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that is currently doing its job in Ukraine. Charges of espionage that have been issued to the group by the pro-Russian activists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk cannot be dismissed altogether as a minimum and in addition to it a question arises on why the detained officers are traveling the east of Ukraine precisely at this moment Neu said. The group that supposedly includes three German military experts a translator and observers from Denmark Poland the Czech Republic and Sweden one person from each country arrived in Ukraine under the cover of the OSCE at the invitation of Ukrainian government. It was arrested by peoples self-defense forces near the eastern town of Slavyansk Friday with the city officials saying the group had been engaging in espionage. On Sunday Bundeswehr Colonel Alex Schneider one of the groups members appeared at a news conference in Slavyansk to tell the reporters that he and other members of the group were getting fair and friendly treatment from their detainers in the rebellious East-Ukrainian city where the population is demanding a referendum on the future status of the Donbass Coalfields area and Ukraines changeover to a federated state structure. Col Schneider said the military experts making up the group were in good health and no one had done physical harm to them after their detention. He added he did not known when their release might take place. He said members of the group had spoken much to the people who had been guarding them since their arrival in Slavyansk and they had learned much about how the situation was affecting the locals families and how the current situation was exerting impact on peoples lives. Col Schneider also said the group members had been stunned upon seeing the level of impoverishment of the local people. In the meantime a spokesman for Bundeswehr said Sunday the dispatching of observers to Ukraine by a number of member-states of the OSCE had been coordinated with the security organizations steering bodies. He said the case in hand was not a bilateral measure of any kind but rather a coordinated mission at the invitation of the Kiev authorities adding that inspections of this kind began last month. The spokesman said that Germany was the fourth country to take on the leadership of a mission the alleged purpose of which was to build up transparency and to steer the formation of trust.

Right Sector still active despite Geneva deals Sergei Lavrov The Geneva Statement in particular envisions that all illegal armed formations should be disarmed in Ukraine MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. The Right Sector far-right ultranationalist Ukrainian group is still active despite agreements reached in Geneva last week Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday. US not ready to admit it cant run the show around globe Sergei Lavrov In Geneva [we] agreed that any violence should be stopped Lavrov said in an interview with RT television channel. However on the next day [Ukrainian parliament-appointed acting president Alexander] Turchynov ordered the army to shoot at unarmed people taking part in peaceful protests. In Geneva [we] also agreed on disarmament of extremists but the Right Sector is still rather active he said. The Geneva Statement adopted after last Thursdays meeting on Ukraine that involved Russia the United States the European Union and Ukraine in particular envisions that all illegal armed formations should be disarmed in Ukraine all administrative buildings unblocked and all protesters except for those who committed serious crimes pardoned. The new regime should start releasing political prisoners and implementing the agreements reached on February 21 which require among other things the surrender of illegal held arms. The authorities must disarm the Right Sector and they must stop making empty promises that all regions will be engaged in the constitutional reform Lavrov said in an interview with the Russia Today television channel on Wednesday April 23. He noted that the purpose of the agreement signed by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the opposition on February 21 was to make Yanukovych assume an obligation not to use police and not to declare a state of emergency. We can say that it was a capitulation. Everything he promised was done. Some say that he did not sign a law restoring the previous constitution but this law entered into force anyway. Therefore all of the oppositions demands were met Lavrov said adding that the opposition failed to keep its word. The purpose of the Geneva agreement of April 17 was to try to put the process back on track including constitutional reform that will engage all regions on an equal basis. Unfortunately the agreement has not been implemented by those who must take the first step the minister said. People need real actions. They are fed up with empty promises and are waiting for the order allowing the use of army against civilians to be cancelled Lavrov said. Russia surprised by distorted interpretation of Geneva statement by Kiev Right Sector actions threaten Geneva deals implementation - Russian FM Ukraine saw a coup and new people were brought to power amid riots in February whom Moscow does not recognize as Ukraine's legitimate leaders. The crisis deteriorated when Crimea where most residents are Russians refused to recognize the legitimacy of the self-proclaimed Ukrainian leaders and reunified with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which it overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation.

Russian FM: OSCE media freedom representatives remarks on Ukraine distort reality MOSCOW April 23./ITAR-TASS/. OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatovics remarks on the situation in Ukraine distort reality and undermines the authority of this international organisation the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. Moscow has noted the surprisingly biased analysis of the situation regarding the freedom of the media in Ukraine which was made by Dunja Mijatovic in an interview to CNN after a visit to that country the ministry said. The impression is that while announcing her assessments the OSCE representative does not understand or does not want to understand the real causes of the extraordinary danger hanging over the freedom of expression in Ukraine. She mentioned only cursorily more than 200 attacks on journalists on the territory controlled by the Kiev authorities. This is probably the first time after the end of World War Two that representatives of ultra-radical neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic movements have come to power in Europe. It is not surprising that they have basically imposed political censorship in the country the ministry said. Mijatovics position requires her to conduct an objective review of facts and help solve problems pertaining to the violation of the freedom of the media it said. In accordance with her mandate the OSCE representative should have urged those who are holding power in Kiev to begin investigating offences committed against journalists by extremist groups and restrictions on the freedom of the media. Dunja Mijatovics mission is to make Kiev correct the situation. She could have publicly demanded during the interview that journalist Konstantin Dolgov who had been arrested in Kiev under far-fetched pretext be released the ministry said. Russia has repeatedly drawn the attention of the authoritative OSCE institution to the essence of the latest developments in Ukraines mass media. But why does Dunja Mijatovic see the problem elsewhere again namely in the legitimate wish of the Russian-speaking population in the South-East of Ukraine which has been cut off by Kiev from Russian television channels to know the truth? Once again the OSCE representative mixed up the cause and the effect. Instead of giving an honest assessment of the atmosphere of information intolerance created by Kiev the CNN viewers for some reason were told about Russian Crimea again the ministry said. And this was done in a distorted manner ignoring the fact that people had for the first time in history had their linguistic and cultural diversity legitimately recognised and could freely choose the Russian information space where many international channels including CNN are available the ministry said. We would not like to believe that such high-ranking OSCE official is intentionally manipulating facts it added. Nevertheless there is the stubborn reluctance to see reality. These actions are not only imposing a distorted perception of the events in Ukraine upon the rest of the world but also undermining the authority of the whole OSCE the ministry said.

Kerry: US may impose sanctions on whole sectors of Russian economy The Secretary of State emphasized that such an option might be possible if Russia does not change its policy towards Ukraine NEW YORK April 29. /ITAR-TASS/. The US may impose sanctions on whole sectors of Russian economy if Russia continues the same policy towards Ukraine. US Secretary of State John Kerry said this in an interview to The Wall Street Journal on Monday. When asked why the American government continues punishing individual Russians or single Russian companies and does not impose broader sanctions on whole sectors of the Russian economy the energy financial or defense sectors Kerry answered: We're inches away from that now. And if they continue on this path that's where it's heading. Regarding the developments in Ukraine the USA has imposed further sanctions against seven Russian officials and 17 companies. In particular the case in hand is freezing assets which may be under Washingtons jurisdiction as well as ban on American visas. According to John Kerry the already imposed sanctions have a certain economic and political effect. The Wall Street Journal notes that the best argument is the fact that Russia hasnt sent its troops to Ukraines east.

Some universities have the status of national but teach only in Ukrainian. It is violation of Russian-speaking citizens' rights isn't?

Centuries-old ties between Russia and Ukraine not to be broken MOSCOW May 01/ITAR-TASS/. The centuries-old ties between Russia and Ukraine cant be broken either by Western politicians or by the anti-popular Kiev regime Valentina Matviyenko Chairperson of the Federation Council upper house of Russian parliament said on Thursday May 1. She believes that the crisis in Ukraine was initiated by the United States and Western countries which once again decided to organise a colour revolution. But they miscalculated. The Libyan Iraqi and Yugoslav scenarios failed in Ukraine. However in the absence of sources of information that would give an objective picture of the situation many people in Ukraine are beginning to believe Western politicians. They [Western countries] have simply set the task of antagonising people against Russia Matviyenko told the Logic of Power programme on Radio Russia. But this is a temporary situation. No one will be able to break up the brotherly people Russians and Ukrainians as there is so much that brings us together. The time of this anti-popular regime which is acting in Ukraine now will pass but all the bonds that held us together for centuries will remain she said. Matviyenko believes that attempts are being made to shift all the blame for this to Russia but all this doesnt hold water. Russia did not take part in organising this chaos. On the contrary it warned against anti-constitutional actions she noted and described the events in Ukraine as an anti-constitutional coup and armed seizure of power. The international community is beginning to understand more and more who created this mess what has actually happened in Ukraine and who is responsible for this she added. Matviyenko also warned against bloodshed and civil war in Ukraine. It is unacceptable to talk to people in the way of force blackmailing and threats. This leads nowhere. This leads to escalation of tensions in Ukraine. Gentlemen stop and think about what you are doing! she said referring not only to the Kiev authorities but also to the West. This is a gridlock. The present authorities acting as guides for the geopolitical interests of the West should openly say so. Or if you think about your country and your people about how to preserve the unity of the country and its stability you should act in a totally different way Matviyenko said. She stressed that Russia will adhere to a firm position in order to prevent bloodshed and protect the people who live there using all available lawful and legal methods through the U.N. Security Council international efforts and other democratic procedures.
