People walk through Red Square with flags and banners during a rally in Moscow May 1 2014. MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia staged a huge May Day parade on Moscow's Red Square for the first time since the Soviet era on Thursday with workers holding banners proclaiming support for President Vladimir Putin after the seizure of territory from neighboring Ukraine. Thousands of trade unionists marched with Russian flags and flags of Putin's ruling United Russia party onto the giant square beneath the Kremlin walls past the red granite mausoleum of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin. Many banners displayed traditional slogans for the annual workers' holiday like: "Peace Labour May". But others were more directly political alluding to the crisis in neighboring former Soviet republic Ukraine where Russian troops seized and annexed the Crimea peninsula in March precipitating the biggest confrontation with the West since the Cold War. "I am proud of my country" read one. "Putin is right" said another. Unlike Kremlin leaders in Soviet times Putin did not personally preside at the parade from atop the mausoleum. But he carried out another Soviet-era tradition by awarding "Hero of Labour" medals to five workers at a ceremony in the Kremlin. He revived the Stalin-era award a year ago. Putin has described the breakup of the Soviet Union as a tragedy and overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy in March by declaring Russia's right to intervene in former Soviet countries to protect Russian speakers. Laws have been changed to make it easier for Russia to annex territory from other former Soviet states and for inhabitants of other parts of the old Soviet Union to get Russian citizenship. Since the annexation of Crimea pro-Moscow gunmen have seized territory in eastern Ukraine and Putin has massed tens of thousands of troops on the frontier. He denies he is planning an invasion but proclaims the right to launch one if necessary to defend Russian speakers. May Day always an important date in the Soviet calendar and still a major holiday for Russians has been marked by rallies in other parts of Moscow since the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991 but until now parades were kept off Red Square. PATRIOTIC UPLIFT Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Rossiya 24 TV from Red Square that more than 100000 people had marched through it. "This is not by chance because there is a patriotic uplift and a good mood in the country" he said. Russian television also showed footage of a May Day parade in Crimea's capital Simferopol with Russian flags and banners reading "Crimea is Russia. Welcome home." "We are sure that the current patriotic uplift in Crimea will spill over into the whole Russian Federation" Interfax news agency quoted Crimea's pro-Moscow leader Sergei Aksyonov as telling journalists. Russia seized the peninsula last month after a pro-Russian Ukrainian president was toppled in February. The United States and European Union accuse Moscow of directing the uprising in south-eastern parts of Ukraine and have imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and companies. The sanctions while not hitting Russia's industry directly have hurt the economy by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The International Monetary Fund cut its outlook for Russian 2014 economic growth this to just 0.2 percent on Wednesday and said Russia was already "experiencing recession". But at home the intervention in Ukraine has been enormously popular. One opinion poll on Wednesday showed 82 percent support for Putin his highest rating since 2010. "Western sanctions won't affect us. Crimea was historically part of Russia and it's only right that we've become whole again" said Tatyana Ivanova a worker at Moscow Housebuilding Factory No. 1 celebrating May Day with four colleagues. But not all Muscovites were so impressed. "Today isn't a particularly special holiday it's just a nice spring day and people are happy to have an opportunity to celebrate" said historian Kirill Strakhov 31 speaking on another square near Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre. "The authorities are trying to drum up support by encouraging patriotic feelings. They ignore the fact that there are many difficult economic and geopolitical problems associated with the unification of Crimea." Putin has also revived the Soviet-era practice of staging massive displays of military firepower on Red Square to mark May 9 the allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two one of the most important days in the Soviet and Russian calendars. Central Moscow streets have been partially closed in recent days as tanks and mobile rocket launchers rehearse for that parade next week.

"Putin_critic_Navalny_gets_reprieve_as_court_finds_fault_with_case",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_15_36_46_GMT",""reuters.html","Putin critic Navalny gets reprieve as court finds fault with case Opposition leader Alexei Navalny talks to the media after leaving a justice court building in Moscow April 22 2014. MOSCOW (Reuters) - A prominent foe of Vladimir Putin won an unexpected judicial respite on Monday when a Moscow court questioned a theft case he sees as the president's revenge for his activism and sent it back to prosecutors for overhaul. The ruling means the second trial of Alexei Navalny who is serving a five-year suspended sentence on a 2013 theft will be put off until prosecutors remove flaws in their case. But it leaves plenty of pressure on Navalny who is under house arrest and is barred from seeking office for years due to the conviction. An avid blogger who built his reputation with an on-line campaign against state corruption he is prohibited from blogging but has supporters posting on his behalf. Navalny said he had no doubt the trial would eventually go ahead. "The court and the prosecutors are just being extra-careful" state-run news agency Rapsi quoted Navalny as saying. Navalny a leader of protests that shook the Kremlin in 2011-2012 could be jailed for years if found guilty of stealing more than 30 million rubles ($832700) from two companies one of them an affiliate of French cosmetics firm Yves Rocher. He and his brother Oleg who is also charged deny guilt. Putting off the trial removes a cause for protests in Russia and for Western criticism at a time when Moscow's relations with the United States and European Union are badly strained over the turmoil in Ukraine and Russia's annexation of the Crimea region last month. The judge's ruling granting Navalny's motion to return the case to prosecutors came at a preliminary hearing on the same day that the United States imposed new sanctions on several Russian officials and companies close to Putin over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis.

A pro-Russian activist hurls an object at supporters of the Kiev government during calshes in the streets of Odessa May 2 2014. Three killed in clashes in Ukraine's Odessa: police 1:13pm EDT Political fever rises as Ukraine breaks apart 12:12pm EDT Ukraine denies Russian blame over Geneva deal accuses Moscow 9:20am EDT Russia to cut gas to Ukraine in June if no prepayment received 10:57am EDT Russia denies saboteurs tried to cross Ukraine border: report 12:04pm EDT SLAVIANSK Ukraine (Reuters) - Pro-Russian rebels shot down two Ukrainian helicopters trying to retake separatist-held Slaviansk on Friday in what Moscow called a "criminal" assault on the eastern town. Separatists said Ukrainian forces killed three of their fighters and two civilians when they moved in on Slaviansk in the early hours. Kiev said two helicopter crew had died and seven servicemen had been wounded in the operation. On the other side of Ukraine police said three people were shot dead and in 15 others were wounded in clashes between people backing Kiev and pro-Russian activists in largely Russian-speaking Odessa. The southern Black Sea port lies close to Crimea which was annexed by Moscow in March following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Moscow president by protesters who took to the streets of Kiev to oppose his decision to scrap a trade deal with Europe. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said Ukrainian forces had fired on civilians from the air in Slaviansk in a "punitive operation" that destroyed an international peace plan. Moscow has tens of thousands of troops massed on the border and claims the right to invade if needed to protect Russian speakers. The Western-backed government in Kiev said the use of missiles that brought down its helicopters was evidence Russian forces were in the town. Moscow denies its troops are on the ground. Ukraine's acting president also said Russian "armed saboteurs" had tried to enter the country overnight but were pushed back by Ukrainian border troops. He gave no further details. Russia's Security Service said the report was untrue. Kiev said Moscow was backing groups in eastern Ukraine who were "putting civilians in danger seizing hostages and creating an atmosphere of terror and violence". Reuters journalists in Slaviansk the most heavily fortified bastion of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine heard shooting break out and saw one helicopter opening fire before dawn. Later in the day the city was largely quiet with shops shut and armed separatists in control of the streets. Advancing Ukrainian forces in armored vehicles took up positions closer in to the suburbs but rebels still controlled most of the town of 130000. Acting President Oleksander Turchinov said the operation had been complicated by the rebels' use of human shields and had not progressed as quickly as had been hoped. SOUND OF CANNON The growing chaos is overshadowing a presidential election the pro-Western leadership in Kiev is planning for May 25. The rebels are planning a vote on May 11 to seek a mandate to break with Kiev like one held in Crimea before Moscow took it over. The United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on individuals over the Ukraine crisis but they have had limited impact. U.S. President Barack Obama said the next step would be sectoral sanctions and they would be imposed if Russia impeded the Ukrainian presidential poll. German Chancellor Angela Merkel visiting Obama in Washington told the same news conference the elections on May 25 were "crucial" and sectoral sanctions were ready. On the square outside city hall in Slaviansk about 100 people gathered on Friday and said they were appealing to Putin to send troops to help them. Businesswoman Tamara Voshchanaya said: "What can you think when the sound of cannon makes you jump out of bed when helicopters are flying over and shooting at our guys? On the town's southern outskirts eight Ukrainian armored personnel carriers cut off the road but faced a cordon of local residents shouting at them to go home. Some rebels erected barricades of trees. Putin's popularity has soared with the seizure of Crimea and talk of restoring Moscow's former empire. This week he restored the Soviet-era tradition of holding a May Day parade on Red Square where marchers carried banners hailing the acquisition of Ukrainian territory. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Russia's actions in Ukraine had shattered the myth of European security in the post-Cold War era and said NATO allies had increased the danger by failing to meet their defense spending pledges. The European Union said it was watching events in eastern Ukraine with growing concern. But Kiev is not a member of NATO and Western leaders have made clear they will not fight to defend Ukraine. HELICOPTERS DOWN The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said two Mi-24 attack helicopters had been shot down by shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles while on patrol overnight around Slaviansk. Two airmen were killed and others wounded. Other Ukrainian officials and the separatist leader in Slaviansk said earlier that one airman was taken prisoner. A third helicopter an Mi-8 transport aircraft was also hit and a serviceman wounded the Defence Ministry said. The SBU security service said this helicopter was carrying medics. Ukrainian officials said their troops overran rebel checkpoints and Slaviansk was now "tightly encircled". Putin's spokesman heaped blame on the Ukrainian government which took power two months ago after pro-Western protests forced the Kremlin-backed elected president to flee to Russia. Noting that Putin had warned before that any "punitive operation" would be a "criminal act" Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that this was what had now happened at Slaviansk. "While Russia is making efforts to de-escalate and settle the conflict the Kiev regime has turned to firing on civilian towns with military aircraft and has begun a punitive operation effectively destroying the last hope of survival for the Geneva accord" he said referring to a deal on April 17 signed by Russia Ukraine the United States and the European Union. Under that agreement separatists were supposed to lay down their arms and vacate the public buildings they have seized in about a dozen towns they have seized across the Russian-speaking east. Since then however they have tightened their grip. Ukraine's Interior Ministry said it persuaded separatists to leave two buildings in the city of Luhansk on Friday. The SBU said the deadly use by the separatists of shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles was evidence that "trained highly qualified foreign military specialists" were operating in the area "and not local civilians as the Russian government says armed only with guns taken from hunting stores". On his Facebook page Interior Minister Arsen Avakov posted: "The goal of our anti-terrorist operation and at the same time our demands to the terrorists are simple: "Free the hostages lay down weapons vacate administrative buildings and get municipal infrastructure back to normal." The rebels said they had the upper hand. "They wanted to carry out some small-scale tactical operations just to scare the people" said a militant at a checkpoint. "But so far things have not worked out the way they wanted."

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un urged the army to develop to ensure it wins any confrontation with the United States the reclusive country's news agency said on Sunday a day after U.S. President Barack Obama warned the North of its military might. Kim led a meeting of the Central Military Commission and "set forth important tasks for further developing the Korean People's Army and ways to do so" KCNA news agency said. "He stressed the need to enhance the function and role of the political organs of the army if it is to preserve the proud history and tradition of being the army of the party win one victory after another in the confrontation with the U.S. and creditably perform the mission as a shock force and standard-bearer in building a thriving nation." Obama said on Saturday on a visit to Seoul where the U.S. army has a large presence that the United States did not use its military might to "impose things" on others but that it would use that might if necessary to defend South Korea from any attack by the reclusive North. North and South Korea are still technically at war after their 1950-53 civil conflict ended in a mere truce. The impoverished North which routinely threatens the United States and the South with destruction warned last month it would not rule out a "new form" of atomic test after the U.N. Security Council condemned Pyongyang's launch of a mid-range ballistic missile into the sea east of the Korean peninsula. North Korea is already subject to U.N. sanctions over its previous three atomic tests. Recent satellite data shows continued work at the nuclear test site in North Korea although experts analyzing the data say that preparations do not appear to have progressed far enough for an imminent test. "We don't use our military might to impose these things on others but we will not hesitate to use our military might to defend our allies and our way of life" Obama told U.S. forces at the Yongsan garrison. "So like all nations on Earth North Korea and its people have a choice. They can choose to continue down a lonely road of isolation or they can choose to join the rest of the world and seek a future of greater opportunity and greater security and greater respect - a future that already exists for the citizens on the southern end of the Korean peninsula."

Their armored divisions would be turned into molten slag in the first week of hostilities and that sorry excuse for an Air Force would lose every aircraft launched and nearly all that remain on the ground in their shelters. What would happen is that North Korea would lose almost all of its military hardware and a huge percentage of its military personel.

"Obama_says_U.S._committed_to_supporting_MH370_search",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_07_22_00_GMT",""reuters.html","A woman holds a sign before U.S. President Barack Obama's arrival at the Young Southeast Asian Leadership Intiative (YSEALI) Town Hall at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur April 27 2014. KUALA LUMPUR/PERTH Australia (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Sunday that the United States was fully committed to providing more assets to assist in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean. "I can tell you the United States is absolutely committed to providing whatever resources and assets that we can" Obama told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. A U.S. Navy submersible drone scanned a remote patch of the Indian Ocean seabed on Sunday in its so far fruitless efforts to find signs of the missing plane but bad weather prevented an air and sea surface search. More than seven weeks after the jet carrying 239 people disappeared enroute from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and six weeks since the search moved from Asia to the Indian Ocean authorities are now regrouping to decide how to proceed. "We are currently consulting very closely with our international partners on the best way to continue the search into the future" the Joint Agency Coordination Centre in charge of the search told Reuters in an email. Malaysia China Japan New Zealand South Korea Britain and the United States are assisting Australia in trying to solve the most expensive search in aviation history. "Obviously we don't know all the details but we do know if in fact the plane went down in the ocean on this part of this world there is a big place and it is very challenging effort and laboriously effort" Obama said. "It is going to take quite some time." A U.S. defense official told Reuters on Friday that the sea search is likely to drag on for years as it enters the much more difficult phase of scouring broader areas of the ocean near where the plane is believed to have crashed. Australia and Malaysia are under pressure to bring closure to the grieving families of those on board MH370 which disappeared on March 8 by finding wreckage to determine what happened to the aircraft. Malaysia is also under growing pressure to improve its disclosure about its investigation although Obama said on Sunday that U.S. authorities had found it to be "fully forthcoming" in sharing information. Najib has said his government would make public a preliminary report into the plane's disappearance next week. Last week Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters that authorities would be "increasing the assets that are available for deep-sea search" and that his government was seeking help from state oil company Petronas which has expertise in deep-sea exploration. The empty expanse of water some 1000 miles northwest of Western Australia's state capital Perth is one of the most remote places in the world and also one of the deepest. Until now the undersea search has been focused on a 10 square km (6.2 square mile) circular zone where a series of "pings" detected earlier this month led authorities to believe the plane's black box flight recorders may be located. The undersea search is set to be extended beyond this small area if the U.S. Bluefin-21 drone fails to find anything the search authority said on Saturday.

"New_group_CubaNow_tells_Obama_it_s_time_to_change_Cuba_policy",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_21_12_09_GMT",""reuters.html","New group #CubaNow tells Obama it's time to change Cuba policy 1 of 5. A poster depicting U.S. President Barack Obama is seen above a passing train at the McPherson Square Metro stop in Washington April 28 2014. MIAMI (Reuters) - A new advocacy group calling for the United States to change its policy toward Cuba launched an advertising campaign on Monday with posters on the Washington D.C. metro system showing President Barack Obama and urging him to "stop waiting." The metro ads by the group #CubaNow are designed to highlight economic changes happening in Cuba. The group believes the 52-year-old U.S. embargo against the communist-ruled island has not worked. "It's time to bring the conversation on U.S.-Cuba policy into the 21st century" said #CubaNow director Ric Herrero. The group said its mission unlike other Cuba policy groups was specifically focused on changing U.S. thinking about Cuba policy. While the group opposes the embargo it recognized that overturning it in Congress is an uphill battle and other ways can be found to change policy such as allowing all Americans to travel to Cuba. "There's plenty the President can do within his existing authority" said #CubaNow founding member Andres Daz a Cuban-born former Obama administration official at the Department of Commerce. #CubaNow was founded by a group of mostly younger generation Cuban Americans. Herrero declined to discuss its funding. The group's launch coincides with the fifth anniversary of Obama's 2009 steps allowing Cuban-Americans to travel freely to visit relatives in Cuba as well as send remittances. That policy shift helped "usher in more change in that time than had been seen in the previous 50 years" the group said in a press release. Herrero said the group based in Miami and Washington wants the White House to take "new steps" to encourage Cuba's burgeoning private sector which has emerged under economic reforms being slowly introduced by the Cuban government. Cuba announced new reforms on Monday loosening regulation of its largest state-run companies including minerals tourism and telecommunications. The group's founding is part of a new wave of efforts to prod Obama into taking bolder steps to engage the Cuban government. It follows a February poll by the Atlantic Council which found a majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba. In November Obama told a Miami area fundraiser that it may be time for the United States to "update" its policies toward Cuba. "Blue jeans and rockn roll brought down the Berlin Wall so we have to recognize that there is a new wave of energy pushing a new approach toward U.S.-Cuba policy" said Alex Castellanos a Republican political strategist who is Cuban American.

It is far more effective to engage your neighbors rather than to punish them (the population collectively I might add) over archaic Cold War sentiments that are completely non-sensical and absurd this day and age. So they want to take the heat off the embargo and concentrate on The embargo is a moral abomination that been repeatedly condemned even by the USAs closest allies at the UN and by groups like Amnesty International.

Attempts to contain the insurgency by the government in Kiev have proved largely unsuccessful with security forces repeatedly outmaneuvered by the separatists. The West and the new Ukrainian government accuse Russia of being behind the unrest a charge Moscow denies. Daniel Baer the U.S. ambassador to the OSCE a European security watchdog which has monitors in the region told reporters in Vienna: "I think it's very clear that what is happening would not be happening without Russian involvement." A police official in Donetsk the provincial capital where separatists have declared a "People's Republic of Donetsk" said separatists were also in control of the Horlivka police station having seized the regional police headquarters earlier in April. The murder of a town councilor from Horlivka who opposed the separatists was cited by Kiev last week among reasons for launching new efforts to regain control of the region. Wednesday's takeovers followed the fall of the main government buildings on Tuesday further east in Luhansk capital of Ukraine's easternmost province driving home just how far control over the densely populated region has slipped from the central government in Kiev. "They've taken them. The government administration and police" the police official said of Horlivka. SECESSION REFERENDUM The town sits just north of Donetsk unofficial capital of the whole Donbass area where mainly Russian-speaking separatists have called a referendum on secession for May 11. Many hope to follow Crimea's break from Ukraine in March and subsequent annexation by Russia following the overthrow of Ukraine's Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in late February in a tug-of-war between the West and Russia over the strategic direction of the former Soviet republic. The Donbass region is home to giant steel smelters and heavy plants that produce up to a third of Ukraine's industrial output. An armed uprising began there in early April with Kiev almost powerless to respond for fear of provoking an invasion by tens of thousands of Russian troops massed on the border. Many Russian-speaking business "oligarchs" from the Donbass backed Yanukovich and exercise great influence over the region. On Wednesday the most powerful of these Ukraine's richest man Rinat Akhmetov issued a formal statement saying he remained committed to his investments in the Donbass and to keeping the region as part of Ukraine. Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk warned his ministers their jobs were on the line if the east remained out of reach - "The country demands action" he said. Oleksander Turchinov Ukraine's acting president until after an election on May 25 reiterated on Wednesday that police were incapable of reasserting control in the region and said the armed forces were on full alert for a Russian invasion. That prompted a return volley from Moscow where the Foreign Ministry demanded that Kiev "immediately ceases the bellicose rhetoric which is aimed at intimidating its own population". There were however more conciliatory noises elsewhere. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not "do stupid things" in response to Western sanctions. Describing a phone call between President Vladimir Putin and British Prime Minister David Cameron the Kremlin said they agreed that only "peaceful means" could resolve the conflict - although Putin has shown little sign of backing down to sanctions. In Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel said she ruled out any military solution to the conflict over Ukraine which is sandwiched between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO bloc: "Would we have learned anything 100 years after the start of World War One and 75 years after the start of World War Two if we resorted to the same methods? No" said Merkel who will visit U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday. "We will not resolve our conflicts in Europe with military means. "Military solutions can be excluded." SANCTIONS COST There were further signs on Monday that Russia is paying an economic price for its involvement in Ukraine. The International Monetary Fund said international sanctions imposed on Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine were hurting the economy. The IMF cut its 2014 growth forecast for Russia to 0.2 percent from 1.3 percent and forecast capital outflows of $100 billion this year. The IMF mission chief to Russia Antonio Spilimbergo also told reporters that Russia was "experiencing recession" and that a resolution of the Ukraine crisis would significantly reduce Russia's own economic uncertainties. "If you understand by recession two quarters of negative economic growth then Russia is experiencing recession now" Spilimbergo said. Ukraine is also suffering from the turmoil with economic output falling 1.1 percent year-on-year in the first three months of 2014 according to government figures released on Wednesday. Gazprom said Ukraine's unpaid bill for gas supplied by the Russian energy giant was now $3.5 billion. However the European Union said it was ready to provide economic aid to Ukraine along with the IMF which on Wednesday approved a $17-billion aid package including an immediate disbursement of $3.2 billion.

Further the 50% higher gas and 40% higher electricity and store prices will hit consumers June 8 and September 8 AFTER the May 25 elections for a 4 year government to replace the current illegal Kiev regime. The timing gives the APPEARANCE that the election is being rigged to put officials in office BEFORE citizens/voters know that they have been set up to suffer when it was not necessary. It is probable that demonstrations riots and the overthrow of local regional and national regimes will begin this summer and continue through the end of the year or until the Ukrainian leaders Without taking sides Putin offered a better plan that included repayment without unfairly punishing the poor for the mistakes of others.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Sunday that the rights of Myanmar's minority Muslim population were not being fully protected and warned that the Southeast Asian country would not succeed if Muslims there were oppressed. On a visit to Malaysia Obama praised political reforms under way in once-isolated Myanmar but said the danger of democratization was that it could unleash religious and ethnic conflicts and that such developments could move Myanmar in a bad direction. "You have a Muslim minority (in Myanmar) that the broader population has historically looked down upon and whose rights are not being fully protected" Obama told a townhall-style meeting of young leaders from across Southeast Asia. "Myanmar won't succeed if the Muslim population is oppressed." Members of Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority have been the victims of attacks and widespread abuse in recent years blamed by human rights groups and other observers on security forces and anti-Muslim mobs in the country's Rakhine state.

The Foreign Ministry said on Thursday the diplomat had been detained a day earlier and declared persona non grata. Ukraine's security service said he was a Russian intelligence officer who had been collecting intelligence on "Ukrainian-NATO military and political cooperation". "On April 30 he was caught red-handed receiving classified material from his source" said Maryna Ostapenko a spokeswoman for Ukraine's security service the SBU. She described the source as a colonel in the Ukrainian armed forces. Ukraine says Russia stands behind the fall of towns and cities over the past month in the country's industrial east to pro-Russian separatists often involving well-organized masked gunmen in military fatigues. Russia denies having any part in the rebellion but has warned it reserves the right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians - following its annexation of Crimea in late March - and has massed tens of thousands of troops on its western frontier with Ukraine. Ostapenko said the attach had been handed over to the Russian embassy and ordered to leave though she was not sure if he had yet done so. There was no immediate response from Moscow which like Kiev was observing the May 1 holiday. Ukraine's pro-Western leaders conceded on Wednesday they were "helpless" to counter the fall of government buildings and police stations to the separatists in the Donbass coal and steel belt source of around a third of the country's industrial output. "PROVOCATIONS" Having seized key buildings in the capital of the easternmost province Luhansk on Tuesday gunmen took control at dawn on Wednesday in the nearby towns of Horlivka and Alchevsk. Thursday was relatively quiet. Following a now familiar pattern local media reported that some 30 armed men had seized the town hall in the small town of Amvrosiivka near the border home to around 19000 people and forced the mayor to sign his resignation. They hoisted the Russian tricolor. In Donetsk the biggest city to fall with around 1 million people mainly Russian-speaking separatists have declared a "People's Republic of Donetsk" and called a referendum on secession for May 11 threatening to undercut a planned presidential election in Ukraine two weeks later. Ukraine hopes the presidential poll will help restore order after five months of civil turmoil that saw Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich toppled after street protests and gun battles in central Kiev and Russia's subsequent annexation of the Crimean peninsula. Pro-Western authorities that took power with Yanukovich's overthrow accuse Russia of planning to disrupt the presidential election create instability and frustrate the new government's hopes of Western integration. Overnight the state security guard responsible for securing key government sites and officials carried out a small drill in central Kiev. Four armored personnel carriers trundled through the streets to parliament where several dozen troops took position as if responding to a threat. The guard's commander Valery Galetey said they were training for possible "provocations" during the May 25 election.

"Obama_arrives_in_Manila_as_Philippines_U.S._sign_security_pact",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_09_02_03_GMT",""reuters.html","Obama hails security pact with Philippines says no threat to China 1 of 3. U.S. President Barack Obama walks with President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines at the Malacanang Palace in Manila April 28 2014. U.S. removes Philippines from copyright blacklist Mon Apr 28 2014 MANILA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said a new military pact signed with the Philippines on Monday granting a larger presence for U.S. forces would bolster the Southeast Asian country's maritime security but was not aimed at countering China's growing military might. The agreement which will have an initial 10-year term was touted as the highlight of Obama's first visit to the Philippines the United States' oldest ally in the region. It sets the framework for a beefed-up rotation of U.S. troops ships and warplanes through the Philippines part of a rebalancing of U.S. resources towards fast-growing Asia and the Pacific. But China interprets the move as an attempt to contain its increasing military capability and embolden Manila in a decades-long territorial dispute with Beijing. "The goal for this agreement is to build Philippine capacity to engage in training engage in coordination not simply to deal with issues of maritime security but also to enhance our capabilities so that if there is a natural disaster that takes place we can respond quickly" Obama told a joint news conference in Manila after talks with President Benigno Aquino. "Our goal is not to counter China our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make sure that international rules and norms are respected and that includes the area of maritime disputes." He reiterated Washington's support for Manila's move to seek international arbitration over conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea an important shipping route that is believed to be rich in energy resources. REGIONAL TENSIONS The Philippines is the last stop on a week-long tour of Asia partly aimed at reassuring U.S. allies that Washington remains committed to its strategic "pivot" to the region. Obama said all four countries he has visited including Japan which has its own dispute with China over tiny islands in the East China Sea were committed to seeking a peaceful resolution of territorial issues. China claims about 90 percent of the South China Sea a claim that overlaps with those of the Philippines Brunei Malaysia Vietnam and Taiwan. China has rejected international arbitration preferring a bilateral route to solving the jurisdictional disputes. Rising regional tensions were highlighted by a commentary from China's state news agency Xinhua criticizing the pact. "Given that the Philippines is at a bitter territorial row with China the move is particularly disturbing as it may embolden Manila in dealing with Beijing" the commentary said. "A more assertive or even reckless Manila would stoke regional tensions and in turn upset Obama's policy of rebalancing." Aquino said China "shouldn't be concerned" about the new agreement which is aimed at increasing joint military training especially for disaster relief operations. The United States and the Philippines will hold joint exercises next week in areas mostly north of the capital. "We are not a threat militarily to any country we don't even have ... presently a single fighter aircraft in our inventory" Aquino said adding his country had "legitimate needs" to protect its 36000 km (22370 miles) coastline. NO NEW BASES The United States was not seeking to rebuild old military bases or construct new ones under the agreement said Obama who was greeted with a 21-gun salute upon his arrival at the presidential palace in the former U.S. colony. Dozens of anti-U.S. protesters shouted slogans and waved banners to protest against his visit outside the palace. The United States had maintained two military bases northwest of Manila including Subic Bay which was once its biggest overseas naval base until the Philippine Senate ordered U.S. troops to leave in 1991. Eight years later the Senate approved an agreement providing for temporary visits by U.S. forces allowing the staging of joint military exercises. Officials said the new security accord did not specify the number of U.S. troops and equipment to be deployed in the country with those details to be discussed separately by the two governments. "They can do construction and upgrade of infrastructure they can store or preposition defense equipment supplies and material as well as hard equipment and supplies" said Lourdes Yparraguirre Philippine ambassador to Austria and a member of the negotiating panel that worked on the deal for eight months. "China was never discussed in the negotiations" she told reporters on the sidelines of a signing ceremony hours before Obama's arrival. "We don't aim to contain or confront anyone. I hope that our neighbors in the region would also view this agreement as a positive contribution to peace stability security and prosperity in the region." While some analysts believe the new military agreement with Washington raises Manila's military capabilities others think it will create more problems for the country. "Relations with China...will deteriorate further in the context of maritime disputes. China is averse to any Philippine government initiative to involve the U.S. in its security agenda" said Rommel Banlaoi analyst at the Center for Intelligence and National Security in Manila. "We are strengthening our relationship with the U.S. at the expense of our relationship with China" he said.

"NATO_allies_must_step_up_defense_spending_U.S._defense_chief_says",""Fri_02_May_2014_12_56_54_GMT",""reuters.html","U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel answers questions following his remarks on NATO expansion and European security at the Wilson Center in Washington May 2 2014. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia's actions in Ukraine have shattered the myth of European security in the post-Cold War era and underscored the danger NATO allies have created by failing to meet their defense spending pledges U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Friday. The Pentagon chief in a speech on the future of the 28-nation alliance said Russia's seizure of the Crimean peninsula and other action in the region had "reminded NATO of its founding purpose" and "presented a clarifying moment for the transatlantic alliance." He also raised a longstanding U.S. concern about NATO defense spending noting that American outlays on security are three times that of the other 27 partners combined even though the U.S. gross domestic product is smaller than their total GDP. "This lopsided burden threatens NATO's integrity cohesion and capability - and ultimately both European and transatlantic security" Hagel said in remarks at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. "We must see renewed financial commitments from all NATO members." Only four of the NATO partners met their agreed target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense in 2013 - Estonia Greece Britain and the United States. France and Turkey fell just shy of the 2 percent goal. Hagel said one of the biggest obstacles to investment in defense was the sense that the prospect of conflict among nations had dissipated with the end of the Cold War. "Russia's actions in Ukraine shatter that myth and usher in bracing new realities" he said. Given Moscow's actions in Ukraine NATO in the future "should expect Russia to test our alliance's purpose stamina and commitment" he added. "We cannot take for granted even in Europe that peace is underwritten by the credible deterrent of military power" the U.S. defense chief said calling for greater coordination among the allies on defense investments as well as higher levels of spending. Hagel's comments came amid increased violence between Ukrainian loyalists and Russian separatists despite an international peace deal and echoed calls by other top U.S. officials this week for NATO members to shore up their commitments. On Friday pro-Russian rebels shot down two Ukrainian helicopters killing two people as Ukrainian forces tightened their siege of separatist-held Slaviansk. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday urged NATO allies who are not meeting the 2 percent defense spending benchmark to boost their payments to the alliance in the next five years. To help meet the goal of increasing defense spending Hagel called for NATO members' finance ministers or budget officials to attend an alliance meeting to discuss the issue. Spending imbalances among the NATO partners has been a longstanding complaint of U.S. defense secretaries. Three years ago then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates used his final speech in Europe as Pentagon chief to deliver a parting shot at the allies saying the NATO members risked "collective military irrelevance" unless they bore more of the burden and boosted military spending. His remarks came in the context of the Western-backed 2011 ouster of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's government which exposed a number of weaknesses among the European partners' militaries such as a lack of intelligence and reconnaissance aircraft and specialists needed to identify bombing targets.

In the regional capital Donetsk club-wielding pro-Russian activists broke up a rally by supporters of the Western-backed government in Kiev. The high-profile mayor of Kharkiv Ukraine's second city was badly wounded by a gunman raising fears of further unrest in a Russian-speaking region that has seen less trouble of late than the neighboring provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. U.S. sanctions were aimed Washington officials said at "cronies" of Putin. Seven men including Sechin were targeted by visa bans and freezing of any U.S. assets and 17 companies were also named. "The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally" Obama said. "The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul." Washington will also deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities and revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions the White House said. In addition to Sechin the Russians sanctioned by the United States included another Putin ally Sergei Chemezov head of Rostec a Russian state-owned high-tech products company. The others named were Oleg Belavencev Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea Dmitry Kozak deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation Evgeniy Murov director of Russia's federal protective service Aleksei Pushkov a state Duma deputy and Vyacheslav Volodin a Putin adviser. Not included was Gazprom chief Alexei Miller a close ally of Putin who had been seen as a possible target. Obama is under pressure from opposition Republicans at home to move faster on sanctions. But in taking what he described as "calibrated steps" he has emphasized a need to act in concert with European countries which have more at stake economically and a more cumbersome process for taking decisions. There was little prospect of a change in the calculus for Putin who critics say is stirring up fear among ethnic Russians in order to redraw post-Soviet borders and rebuild Moscow's empire. "Washington is in effect reviving ... an old method of restricting normal cooperation from Cold War times essentially chasing itself into a dark dusty closet of a bygone era" said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov describing the sanctions as illegitimate uncivilized and in breach of international law. In an hour-long phone call with U.S. Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu voiced concern about an "unprecedented" increase in U.S. and NATO activity near Russia's borders and urged Hagel to help "turn down the rhetoric" over Ukraine Moscow's Defense Ministry said. RALLY ATTACKED Both sides continue to offer diametrically mirror-image versions of events in Ukraine. The West sees the pro-Western leaders who took power after Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovich fled to Russia in February as legitimate and believes Putin is trying to undermine their efforts to hold an election. For Moscow they are "fascists" and "putschists" anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalists against whom the Russian speakers of Crimea and the east have risen up in self-defence - a view it broadcasts into Ukraine on state-run Russian media. Opinion polls show substantial but still only minority support in the depressed industrial east of Ukraine for it to follow Crimea into union with Russia. Several people were injured on Monday after dozens of men in military fatigues carrying baseball bats and throwing firecrackers tried to break up a demonstration in Donetsk. A crowd of about 2000 waved Ukrainian flags and chanted: "Donetsk is Ukraine" and "Putin no" but they dispersed after the assault in which Reuters journalists saw at least 10 people treated for head injuries. Earlier in the same region armed men in camouflage who refused to identify themselves seized the police station and town hall in Kostyantynivka. Reuters journalists saw about 20 well-organized gunmen controlling the administration building. They erected a barricade of tires sandbags and concrete blocks. Soviet songs played over loudspeakers and women gathered signatures in support of an uprising against rule from Kiev. Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes a colorful and well-known figure nationwide was shot in the back while out exercising and doctors are battling to save his life. Kernes 54 is a member of the party through which Yanukovich and fellow easterners had dominated a Ukrainian system widely seen as deeply corrupt. Among the most prominent Jewish politicians in the country who earned his wealth from business dealings in the crime-ridden 1990s Kernes had called for Kharkiv to quit Ukraine after Yanukovich fell but had lately clamped down on separatists. The government said police were looking into whether the assassination attempt was linked to the arrest of pro-Russian separatists on Sunday. GERMAN HOSTAGES Although Russia signed a deal with Ukraine and Kiev's U.S. and EU allies at Geneva 10 days ago under which militants should surrender to OSCE monitors it flatly denies Ukrainian and Western assertions it is controlling the militants' activities and that it has special forces orchestrating events on the ground. "Russia's involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable" a White House statement said. After an appeal from Germany long Moscow's firmest advocate in the West for Russia to intervene to secure the release of the seven European monitors four of whom are German Moscow's ambassador to the OSCE said it would be good if they were freed. But he also condemned the OSCE of which Russia is a member for being "extremely irresponsible" in sending them to eastern Ukraine. Moscow has condemned the Kiev authorities for failing to provide security in the industrial and heavily populated east close to the Russian border. In the face of Western and Ukrainian calls for it to pull back troops massed on Ukraine's frontier the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday it had "deep concern" about forces Kiev has sent to the region suggesting that Ukrainian troops might be preparing for "the destruction of entire cities". In the separatist military stronghold at Slaviansk the self-declared mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov said he had given OSCE mediators a list of detainees his movement wanted freed by Kiev in return for the OSCE observers he is holding. The Russian Foreign Ministry said the jailed leader of an earlier separatist protest in Donetsk was on hunger strike to protest against his torture. It also cited reports that Ukraine was building detention centers "very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps" for "dissenting citizens" in the east. The Moscow stock market shrugged off the sanctions rising almost 1 percent when they failed to penalize more companies. Although its chief executive Sechin was hit by a visa ban few expected Rosneft or its international partners to suffer much though its shares lost 1.7 percent on the day. Western countries say sanctions are already having an effect on Russia by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The central bank has raised interest rates to support the ruble and Russian firms are finding it harder to raise funds.

"Obama_reaffirms_commitment_to_Japan_on_tour_of_Asia_allies",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_13_12_21_GMT",""reuters.html","Obama reaffirms commitment to Japan on tour of Asia allies 1 of 8. U.S. President Barack Obama shakes hands with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (R) at a joint news conference at the Akasaka Palace in Tokyo April 24 2014. TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama assured ally Japan on Thursday that Washington was committed to its defense including of tiny isles at the heart of a row with China but denied he had drawn any new "red line" and urged peaceful dialogue over the islands. His comments drew a swift response from China which said the disputed islets were Chinese territory. Obama also urged Japan to take "bold steps" to clinch a two-way trade pact seen as crucial to a broad regional agreement that is a central part of the U.S. leader's "pivot" of military diplomatic and economic resources towards Asia and the Pacific. U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators failed to resolve differences in time for Obama and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to shake hands on a deal at the summit. The leaders reported progress but Japan's economics minister Akira Amari said later that remaining sticking points could not be resolved quickly. Obama on the start of a four-nation tour is being treated to a display of pomp and ceremony meant to show that the U.S.-Japan alliance the main pillar of America's security strategy in Asia is solid at a time of rising tensions over growing Chinese assertiveness and North Korean nuclear threats. "We don't take a position on final sovereignty determinations with respect to Senkaku but historically they have been administered by Japan and we do not believe that they should be subject to change unilaterally and what is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by Japan" Obama said. "This is not a new position this is a consistent one" he told a joint news conference after his summit with Abe using the Japanese name for the islands that China which also claims sovereignty over them calls the Diaoyu. "In our discussions I emphasized with Prime Minister Abe the importance of resolving this issue peacefully" Obama added. Whilst his comments amounted to a restatement of longstanding U.S. policy there was symbolism in the commitment being stated explicitly by a U.S. president in Japan. Responding to Obama's remarks Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a daily press briefing in Beijing that the islands belonged to China. "The so-called U.S.-Japan security treaty is a product of the Cold War era and it cannot be aimed at a third party and ought not to harm China's territorial sovereignty" he said. "No matter what anyone says or does it cannot change the basic reality that the Diaoyu Islands are China's inherent territory and cannot shake the resolve and determination of the Chinese government and people to protect (our) sovereignty and maritime rights." INTERNATIONAL RULES Obama also said there were opportunities to work with China - which complains that his real aim is to contain its rise - but called on the Asian power to stick to international rules. "What we've also emphasized and I will continue to emphasize throughout this trip is that all of us have responsibilities to help maintain basic rules of the world and international order so that large countries small countries all have to abide by what is considered just and fair" he said. Some of China's neighbors with territorial disputes with Beijing worry that Obama's apparent inability to rein in Russia which annexed Crimea last month could send a message of weakness to China. Obama told the news conference that additional sanctions were "teed up" against Russia if it does not deliver on promises in an agreement reached in Geneva last week to ease tensions in Ukraine. Obama and Abe also agreed that their top trade aides U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Amari would keep trying to narrow gaps in their trade talks. "This is not something we can reach a conclusion (on) in a short period of time" Amari told reporters after meeting Froman again after the leaders' summit. Abe has touted the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as key to the "Third Arrow" of his economic program to reinvigorate the world's third-biggest economy along with hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending. Both sides have also stressed that the TPP would have strategic implications by creating a framework for business that could entice China to play by global rules. But the talks have been stymied by Japan's efforts to protect politically powerful agriculture sectors such as beef and disputes over both countries' auto markets. Pointing to restrictions on access to Japan's farm and auto sectors Obama said: "Those are all issues that people are all familiar with and at some point have to be resolved. I believe that point is now." Experts had said failure to reach a final deal could cast doubts on Abe's commitment to economic reform and take the wind out of the sails of a drive for a broader TPP agreement. "If they don't show progress ... it will be harder to use TPP as a spur to reforms" said Robert Feldman a managing director at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities in Tokyo. "It gives the anti-reform forces aid and comfort." DIPLOMATIC CHALLENGE The diplomatic challenge for Obama during his week-long four-nation regional tour is to convince Asian partners that Washington is serious about its promised strategic "pivot" while at the same time not harming U.S. ties with China the world's second-biggest economy. Obama will also travel to South Korea Malaysia and the Philippines. Abe - who repeatedly referred to the U.S. president as "Barack" during their news conference - and Obama were keen to send a message of solidarity after U.S-Japan ties were strained by Abe's December visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine seen by critics as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Japan lobbied hard to get the White House to agree to an official state visit the first by a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton in 1996. Abe is trying to soothe U.S. concerns that his conservative push to recast Japan's war record with a less apologetic tone is overshadowing pragmatic policies on the economy and security. "Seventy years ago when the war ended Japan gave grave damage and pain to many people particularly people in Asia. Japan started taking post-war steps by reflecting on this. Japan and Japanese people have continued to take the path of peace for the past 70 years" Abe told the joint news conference. "Japan has strived to create a free and democratic country after the war. We have been building a country that respects human rights and the rule of law" he said.

"Exclusive_EU_considers_ban_on_deals_with_banks_in_Crimea",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_13_33_35_GMT",""reuters.html","Exclusive: EU considers ban on deals with banks in Crimea An European Union flag hangs outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels February 13 2014. BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union may ban transactions with financial institutions in Crimea as part of its response to the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula by Russia last month an EU document obtained by Reuters showed. EU leaders consider the takeover as illegal and have asked the EU executive arm the European Commission to propose economic trade and financial restrictions on Crimea for rapid implementation. These proposals are separate from an EU discussion on stepped-up sanctions against Russia if Moscow does not help deescalate tensions in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and the government in Kiev. The document spelt out some of the practical difficulties involved in implementing sanctions specifically against Crimea now that it is de facto a part of Russia. "Solutions need to be found that at the same time support the territorial integrity of Ukraine do not recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea defend European interests in this region and do not penalize the Crimean people" the Commission said in a document prepared for EU governments to consider. One way to discourage or penalize financial institutions in Crimea that cooperated with the annexation could be to restrict capital movements between the EU and those banks it said and bar EU citizens or businesses from carrying out transactions with them. "The same could hold for prohibiting investments by Crimean investors (companies located or registered in Crimea) into the EU and by EU investors into Crimean entities" it said. The Commission proposals are still under review and a decision whether to follow them is likely to be taken by EU foreign ministers whose next meeting is on May 12. Out of Crimea's 1000 bank branches around 60 were owned by EU banks the Commission said. Italy's Unicredit had 20 Austria's Raiffeisen had 32 and Hungarian OTP had six the Commission said. However Raiffeisen closed its operations in Crimea in early April it said and Unicredit wants to transfer its Crimea branches to its Russian subsidiary. "Russian banks are gradually taking over in Crimea but the main Russian banks (Sberbank and VTB ) reportedly are reluctant to do so for fear of becoming subject to European or U.S. sanctions" the Commission document said. NO PREFERENTIAL TRADE TERMS The Commission noted that by the end of April Ukrainian exporters will be in a position to trade under two preferential arrangements with the EU and enjoy significant tariff reductions. But the exporters need to have a certificate of origin for their goods and Ukraine will stop issuing such certificates to companies based in Crimea. However the Commission document noted that there was practically no way to prevent Crimean products from being exported to the EU via Russia unless they were clearly of Crimean origin like wine. The only way to guarantee an absolute ban on imports from Crimea would be to suspend trade with Russia entirely the document said - an option which it made clear was not feasible. "In addition to the political consequences this would have such a ban would also involve legal risks as it would require justification under World Trade Organisation law. A more practical option would consist in limiting the ban on import only to the products of clear Crimean origin such as wines." Crimea has taken ownership of Ukraine's state companies on its territory including the region's Black Sea natural gas fields. Black Sea gas production is currently only one billion cubic meters per year but Ukraine had hoped it would increase to 3 billion cubic meters in 2015 and it had attracted foreign investors including majors Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. The paper said Crimea residents would have to apply for visas to the EU through Kiev because allowing them to apply via an EU consulate in Moscow would amount to indirect recognition of the illegal annexation. The Commission also proposed that EU countries should not recognize passports issued by Russia to Crimea residents after the annexation.

Only Russians can decide when they want to live in peace with the world they must get rid of dictator rasPutin. Revolution in Moscow this August. It is coming. How stupid can the EU be. The event in Ukraine are motivated by pure economic interests of the US. But the sad thing is it is going to be Europe that would end up paying price for this misadventure. In addition to EU being made to bear the cost of stabalizing Ukraine after the messed-up situation there the imminent incraese in cost of gas will be a double whammy for European nations. On one hand it will make manufacturing even less competitive compared to China and the US (which is expereincing a revival thanks to cheaper energy costs due to shale revolution) and secondly it will increase costs of living further crimping any revival in consumer spending. With massive youth unemplyment and under-employment Europe does not need a manufactured US crisis. Unless European leaders have already decided that turning Europe into a war-zone will provide more fruitful employment to youth than any other option with them. It is time for EU to disassociate itself from events where escalation in any form will only benefit American interests while making Europe even weaker and dependent on the US. That would mean Europe ending up buying expensive US shale gas European manufacturing being further decimated American exporters will be happy to fill this gap .And Europe will end up stationing even more US troops. East-ward expansion of NATO/EU ensures that Americans can piggy-back on the more insecure setiments of Eastern European nations and will continue to have leverage in European affairs.

"Ukraine_forces_kill_up_to_five_rebels_Russia_starts_drill_near_border",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_15_53_53_GMT",""reuters.html","Ukraine forces kill up to five rebels Russia starts drill near border 1 of 12. Ukrainian soldiers stand guard at a checkpoint in the village of Malinivka east of Slaviansk in eastern Ukraine April 24 2014. Ukraine forces kill up to five rebels Russia starts drill near border Kerry: window closing for Russia to change course in Ukraine Thu Apr 24 2014 Hagel says Russian actions on Ukraine border worrisome Thu Apr 24 2014 Russia demands U.S. stop Ukraine's military operation Thu Apr 24 2014 US slams new Russian military exercises near Ukraine Thu Apr 24 2014 SLAVIANSK Ukraine/ST PETERSBURG Russia (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces killed up to five pro-Moscow rebels on Thursday as they closed in on the separatists' military stronghold in the east and Russia launched army drills near the border in response raising fears its troops would invade. The Ukrainian offensive amounts to the first time Kiev's troops have used lethal force to recapture territory from the fighters who have seized swathes of eastern Ukraine since April 6 and proclaimed an independent "People's Republic of Donetsk". Ukraine's acting president accused Moscow of supporting "terrorism at the state level" against his country for backing the rebels who the government blames for kidnapping and torturing a politician found dead on Saturday. The Ukrainian Interior Ministry said its forces backed by the army had removed three checkpoints manned by armed groups in the  city of Slaviansk. "During the armed clash up to five terrorists were eliminated" it said in a statement adding that one person had been wounded on the side of the government forces. A rebel spokeswoman in Slaviansk said two fighters had died in a clash in the same area northeast of the city center. Slaviansk's separatist self-proclaimed mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov quoted on a local news site said one man was shot dead and another badly wounded on the northeastern outskirts of the city. He said the dead had been unarmed. The Kremlin which says it has the right to invade its neighbor to protect Russian speakers has built up forces on Ukraine's border - estimated by NATO at up to 40000 troops. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu announced Moscow had launched military drills near the border in response to "Ukraine's military machine" and NATO exercises in eastern Europe. Kiev demanded an explanation within 48 hours of action on the border. Russia already seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine last month after President Vladimir Putin overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy by announcing the right to use military force in neighboring countries. An invasion of mainland Ukraine's industrial heartland would be a far more serious action. It had seemed beyond contemplation only weeks ago but now looks like a real threat although the full extent of Putin's territorial ambitions remains a mystery. In St Petersburg Putin said that if the authorities in Kiev had used the army in eastern Ukraine it would be a very serious crime against their own people. "It is just a punitive operation and it will of course incur consequences for the people making these decisions including (an effect) on our interstate relations" Putin said in a televised meeting with regional media. Washington criticized the Russian drills on the frontier. It was "exactly the opposite of what we have been calling on the Russians to do which is to de-escalate the situation" Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said. Russia's Foreign Ministry responded that it was up to Washington to halt the Ukrainian military action and "force the Kiev authorities who are wards of the United States to restrain themselves and not use force." Reuters journalists saw a Ukrainian detachment with five armored personnel carriers take over a checkpoint on a road north of Slaviansk in the late morning after it was abandoned by separatists who set tires alight to cover their retreat. However two hours later the troops pulled back and it was unclear if Kiev would risk storming Slaviansk a city of 130000 that has become the military stronghold of a movement seeking annexation by Moscow of Ukraine's industrialized east. "FINISH WHAT WE HAVE STARTED" At another checkpoint set up by the Ukrainian military a soldier said they were there to instill law and order. "Those separatists they violated the constitution they are torturing the country they violated laws they do not recognize the authority of police so the army had to move in and we will finish what we have started so help me God" he said. Under an accord signed by Russia Ukraine the United States and European Union in Geneva last week illegal armed groups are supposed to disarm and go home including the rebels occupying about a dozen buildings in the largely Russian-speaking east. However the rebels have shown no sign of retreating. U.S. President Barack Obama blamed Russia for failing to carry out the Geneva deal and said he was ready to impose new sanctions. Putin said sanctions were "dishonorable" and destroyed the global economy but that so far the damage had not been critical. Moscow also flexed its economic muscles with the government suggesting foreign firms which pull out of the country may not be able to get back in. A source at Gazprom said the Russian exporter had slapped an additional $11.4 billion bill on Kiev. Ukraine is negotiating to reverse east-west pipelines so that it can receive gas from Europe if Moscow cuts it off. Washington accuses Moscow of sending agents to coordinate the unrest in the east as it did before seizing Crimea last month. Russia denies it is behind the uprising and says the separatists are responding spontaneously to hostility from Kiev. Russia made similar denials over Crimea until Putin acknowledged last week his troops had indeed acted alongside local militia. "At the state level Russia is supporting terrorism in our country" Ukraine's acting President Oleksander Turchinov said in an address to the nation on Thursday. "Armed criminals have taken over buildings are taking citizens Ukrainian and foreign journalists hostage and murdering Ukrainian patriots." Turchinov called for the eastern offensive this week after the apparent torture and murder of a pro-Kiev town councilor whose body was found on Saturday near Slaviansk. Volodymyr Rybak had disappeared after being filmed trying to take down a separatist flag while trying to enter the rebel-held town hall where he worked in Horlivka a town near Slaviansk. "He was bruised and punctured from head to toe...it's clear they tortured him" said Aleksander Yaroshenko a family friend who accompanied Rybak's widow when she identified his body at the morgue. "The police have lots of details they have CCTV footage they should know who did this" he told Reuters. Rebels in Slaviansk released U.S. citizen Simon Ostrovsky one of three journalists they are believed to be holding. Moscow called for Kiev to release "political prisoners" including a pro-Russian activist named Pavel Gubarev. U.S. TROOPS ARRIVE IN POLAND So far the United States and EU have taken only mild action against Moscow imposing visa bans and asset freezes on a few Russians measures Moscow has scoffed at as meaningless. Washington and Brussels both say they are drafting more serious sanctions and will impose them if the Geneva deal collapses. Even without serious sanctions Russia's confrontation with the West has hurt its economy as fearful investors send their money abroad. Mutual funds specializing in Russia and Eastern Europe were the 30 worst performers out of 3489 equity funds for sale in Britain in the three months ending in March. In NATO member Poland the first group of a contingent of around 600 U.S. soldiers arrived on Wednesday part of an effort by Washington to reassure eastern European allies who are worried by the Russian build-up near Ukraine's borders. However NATO and the United States have made clear they will not use military force to protect Ukraine itself. Shoigu the Russian defence minister said aircraft would fly increased patrols near the Ukrainian frontier as part of the new exercises. Two local residents in the area told Reuters they had seen attack helicopters flying in formation. Kiev said the city hall in another eastern town Mariupol which had been seized was back under central control. A separatist crowd later surrounded the building patrolled by police but otherwise apparently empty. Kiev also reported a shootout overnight in another part of the east where a Ukrainian soldier was wounded. Ukraine a former Soviet republic slid into unrest late last year when Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich rejected a pact to build closer ties with Europe. Protesters took over central Kiev and he fled in February. Days later Russian troops seized control of Crimea. The Ukrainian defence ministry confirmed its involvement in the operation around Slaviansk on Thursday saying the troops involved were airborne units with experience of such tasks from international peacekeeping missions. "The morale of our forces will allow them to completely fulfill their task of defending Ukraine" it said. Unarmed mediators from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe are in eastern Ukraine trying to persuade pro-Russian gunmen to go home in line with the Geneva accord. Reuters reporters have not been able to establish that any Russian troops or special forces members are on the ground though Kiev and Western powers say they have growing evidence that Moscow has a presence. Masked gunmen in the east widely referred to as "green men" wear uniforms without insignia. Kiev has been cautious in taking action for fear of triggering a Russian invasion. Last week it ordered an "anti-terrorist operation" but this quickly fizzled out when an armored column of paratroopers surrendered weapons to a separatist crowd.

I have my doubts that many of these are actually rebels. I think it is a safe bet that they are Russians who infiltrated. And how would the U.S. or Russia or any other country respond if armed men stormed and took control of goverment buildings? Im sure we would try and talk them out for a while but in the end everyone no matter what nation is gonna go in and retake their buildings etc. And Im sure Vlad would let this go on in Moscow and handle all the armed men with kid gloves. If they had done this in Moscow they would ALL be dead already. But Russia expects Ukraine to sit by while the entire eastern portion of the country goes to Russia. Vlady Putin wants Ukraine and in the end he will probably get it. All this is a farce to have an excuse to go on in nothing more nothing less. This discussion is now closed.

"Russia_says_Marshall_Islands_nuclear_lawsuits_baseless",""_Mon_28_Apr_2014_19_41_11_GMT",""reuters.html","This U.S. Navy handout image shows Baker the second of the two atomic bomb tests in which a 63-kiloton warhead was exploded 90 feet under water as part of Operation Crossroads conducted at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 to measure nuclear weapon effects on warships. MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday that lawsuits in which the Marshall Islands accused nine nations with nuclear weapons capability of failing in their obligation to negotiate disarmament are "baseless" and would not help rid the world of atomic weapons. The tiny archipelago nation in the Pacific Ocean which was used for U.S. nuclear tests in the 1950s filed lawsuits last week against the United States Russia and seven other countries. The Russian Foreign Ministry expressed surprise at the allegation saying the Cold War arms race was decades in the past and that Russia and the United States had been negotiating nuclear cuts almost constantly for years. "As a result ... Russia has reduced its strategic (long-range) nuclear potential by more than 80 percent and its non-strategic nuclear weapons by three-quarters from their peak numbers" the ministry said in a statement. "We are convinced that filing baseless suits does not foster a favorable conditions for further steps by the international community in the area of arms control and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction" it said. Russia said it had clearly shown it was abiding by the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). However it lamented that "for past 45 years the international community has made no serious efforts" to fulfill the treaty's obligation that signatories seek a pact on "complete disarmament under strict and effective international control". "The Russian Federation is open to interaction with its NPT partners with the aim of seeking the most effective paths to realization of the Treaty" it said. The comments were in line with statements by Russian officials that total disarmament is a good idea in theory. But Russia has also made clear it will not approve cuts below ceilings set in the 2010 New START treaty unless the United States addresses its concerns about U.S. missile defense and non-nuclear weapons capabilities among other things.

"China_resolutely_opposes_U.S._sanctions_on_missile_parts_supplier",""Wed_30_Apr_2014_12_43_47_GMT",""reuters.html","Reuters and other foreign media are subject to Iranian restrictions on leaving the office to report film or take pictures in Tehran. BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday it "resolutely opposes" U.S. sanctions that could harm non-proliferation work between the two countries after Washington laid charges against a Chinese businessman accused of allegedly procuring missile parts for Iran. In a signal Washington would keep pressure on Iran over its nuclear program the U.S. State Department also offered up to $5 million for information leading to businessman Li Fangwei's arrest or conviction. Federal prosecutors also seized $6.9 million in funds that had been traced to Li. "China resolutely opposes the United States citing domestic law to unilaterally impose sanctions on Chinese companies or individuals. We believe that what the United States has done will not help resolve the issue and will harm bilateral cooperation on counter proliferation China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said. China pays great attention to anti-proliferation export controls and will "seriously deal" with any violations of its laws Qin told reporters at a regular press briefing. "China urges the United States to stop these wrong acts of putting sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals and return to the correct path of anti-proliferation cooperation" Qin said. Li has been the target of U.S. sanctions in the past for his alleged role as a supplier to Iran's ballistic missile program. In 2009 he was charged with selling restricted materials to Iran by the Manhattan District Attorney and Treasury banned him and his company LIMMT from conducting business in the United States without a license or authorization. The latest actions further limit Li's ability to conduct business worldwide. Contacted by Reuters on Feb 4 2013 for an earlier story about his business Li said he continued to get commercial inquiries from Iran but only for legitimate merchandise. Li said his metals company LIMMT had stopped selling to Iran once the United States began sanctioning the firm several years ago. Reuters has been unable to contact him since. Calls to multiple telephone numbers of LIMMT based in the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian either went unanswered or the person answering hung up when asked for Li. Described as a "known proliferator" and a "principal supplier" to Iran's ballistic missile program Li has also been accused of trying to buy materials from the United States China and other countries that could be used by Iran to produce or deliver weapons of mass destruction. Iran and a group of world powers reached a temporary agreement in November under which Tehran would get about $7 billion in sanctions relief in return for steps to restrain its nuclear activities. In March a U.S. official said Iran had pursued buying banned components for its nuclear and missile programs even while it was striking the interim deal to limit its disputed nuclear program. Vann Van Diepen principal deputy assistant secretary of state for international security and non-proliferation said Li had continued to supply such items despite U.S. pressure on China to tighten export controls.

Gunmen who turned up at dawn took control of official buildings in Horlivka a town of almost 300000 people said a Reuters photographer. They refused to be photographed. The heavily armed men wore the same military uniforms without insignia as other unidentified "green men" who have joined pro-Russian protesters with clubs and chains in seizing control of towns across Ukraine's Donbass coal and steel belt. Some 30 pro-Russian separatists also seized a city council building in Alchevsk further east in Luhansk region Interfax-Ukraine news agency said. They took down the Ukrainian flag and flew a city banner before allowing workers to leave. Attempts to contain the insurgency by the government in Kiev have proved largely unsuccessful with security forces repeatedly outmaneuvered by the separatists. The West and the new Ukrainian government accuse Russia of being behind the unrest a charge Moscow denies. Daniel Baer the U.S. ambassador to the OSCE a European security watchdog which has monitors in the region told reporters in Vienna: "I think it's very clear that what is happening would not be happening without Russian involvement." A police official in Donetsk the provincial capital where separatists have declared a "People's Republic of Donetsk" said separatists were also in control of the Horlivka police station having seized the regional police headquarters earlier in April. The murder of a town councilor from Horlivka who opposed the separatists was cited by Kiev last week among reasons for launching new efforts to regain control of the region. Wednesday's takeovers followed the fall of the main government buildings on Tuesday further east in Luhansk capital of Ukraine's easternmost province driving home just how far control over the densely populated region has slipped from the central government in Kiev. "They've taken them. The government administration and police" the police official said of Horlivka. SECESSION REFERENDUM The town sits just north of Donetsk unofficial capital of the whole Donbass area where mainly Russian-speaking separatists have called a referendum on secession for May 11. Many hope to follow Crimea's break from Ukraine in March and subsequent annexation by Russia following the overthrow of Ukraine's Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in late February in a tug-of-war between the West and Russia over the strategic direction of the former Soviet republic. The Donbass region is home to giant steel smelters and heavy plants that produce up to a third of Ukraine's industrial output. An armed uprising began there in early April with Kiev almost powerless to respond for fear of provoking an invasion by tens of thousands of Russian troops massed on the border. Many Russian-speaking business "oligarchs" from the Donbass backed Yanukovich and exercise great influence over the region. On Wednesday the most powerful of these Ukraine's richest man Rinat Akhmetov issued a formal statement saying he remained committed to his investments in the Donbass and to keeping the region as part of Ukraine. Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk warned his ministers their jobs were on the line if the east remained out of reach - "The country demands action" he said. Oleksander Turchinov Ukraine's acting president until after an election on May 25 reiterated on Wednesday that police were incapable of reasserting control in the region and said the armed forces were on full alert for a Russian invasion. That prompted a return volley from Moscow where the Foreign Ministry demanded that Kiev "immediately ceases the bellicose rhetoric which is aimed at intimidating its own population". There were however more conciliatory noises elsewhere. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not "do stupid things" in response to Western sanctions. Describing a phone call between President Vladimir Putin and British Prime Minister David Cameron the Kremlin said they agreed that only "peaceful means" could resolve the conflict - although Putin has shown little sign of backing down to sanctions. In Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel said she ruled out any military solution to the conflict over Ukraine which is sandwiched between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO bloc: "Would we have learned anything 100 years after the start of World War One and 75 years after the start of World War Two if we resorted to the same methods? No" said Merkel who will visit U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday. "We will not resolve our conflicts in Europe with military means. "Military solutions can be excluded." SANCTIONS COST There were further signs on Monday that Russia is paying an economic price for its involvement in Ukraine. The International Monetary Fund said international sanctions imposed on Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine were hurting the economy. The IMF cut its 2014 growth forecast for Russia to 0.2 percent from 1.3 percent and forecast capital outflows of $100 billion this year. The IMF mission chief to Russia Antonio Spilimbergo also told reporters that Russia was "experiencing recession" and that a resolution of the Ukraine crisis would significantly reduce Russia's own economic uncertainties. "If you understand by recession two quarters of negative economic growth then Russia is experiencing recession now" Spilimbergo said. Ukraine is also suffering from the turmoil with economic output falling 1.1 percent year-on-year in the first three months of 2014 according to government figures released on Wednesday. Gazprom said Ukraine's unpaid bill for gas supplied by the Russian energy giant was now $3.5 billion. However the European Union said it was ready to provide economic aid to Ukraine along with the IMF which on Wednesday approved a $17-billion aid package including an immediate disbursement of $3.2 billion.

"Syrian_relief_work_hampered_by_U.N._failings_aid_groups_say",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_15_42_57_GMT",""reuters.html","Syrian relief work hampered by U.N. failings aid groups say A United Nations vehicle towing a trailer with humanitarian aid arrives at a besieged area of Homs February 12 2014. BEIRUT (Reuters) - Aid organizations working in Syria say they are growing frustrated at how the United Nations is handling the world's biggest humanitarian crisis accusing it of excluding them and withholding information vital to assist millions in need. A letter obtained by Reuters which was sent to several U.N. Security Council members this month by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in Syria says a lack of coordination by the United Nations means assistance is not reaching some civilians in priority areas. In other regions of the country the U.N. does not inform other aid groups when it brings aid leading to "potential duplication" of deliveries the document said. Syria's war has killed 150000 people and poses an enormous challenge for relief workers. Nine million people inside the country need aid and protection industry and agriculture are failing and 2.5 million refugees have fled abroad. Funding shortfalls combined with restrictions imposed by Damascus and by the fighting have hampered relief efforts. But the NGOs suggested that shortcomings in the aid operations were aggravating the situation calling on the United Nations to demonstrate greater leadership improve coordination and demand better access. U.N. officials in New York Geneva and Damascus declined to comment on the NGO report but U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos has repeatedly said the Syrian government and rebels have not done enough to allow aid in to besieged areas. President Bashar al-Assad's forces and to a lesser extent rebels fighting to overthrow him have been accused of preventing food and medicine from reaching a quarter of a million people in besieged areas seeking to starve opponents into submission. Syrian authorities also frequently dictate how aid is distributed by U.N. agencies who are legally obliged to work with the country's authorities resulting in more supplies going to  areas aid workers say. Seeking to expand the humanitarian reach the U.N. Security Council agreed in February that all sides must allow greater access. But U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week none of Syria's warring parties was adhering to the demand. "WEAK U.N. SYSTEMS" Reuters spoke to three international aid organization that drafted the report to Security Council members. The organizations asked to remain anonymous citing fears that public disclosure would negatively affect their work in Syria. "U.N. agencies ... need to ensure better coordination and leadership" the report said. "Coordination between aid agencies operating from neighboring countries and those present in Damascus continues to be challenging with weak U.N. systems and insufficient capacity currently in place. "In Damascus NGOs are often excluded from decision-making processes related to the planning of aid convoys and discussions on aid delivery mechanisms" it said. The report said aid groups did not take part in a government and U.N. meetings during the evacuation of civilians from besieged areas of Homs city this year. That kind of exclusion means "that information and analysis from a broader range of aid actors are often not taken on board" it said. "Greater U.N. action to press for diplomatic support on key access issues is needed" it added repeating a long-standing criticism that the U.N. has not voiced concerns loud enough when Syrian authorities impede access such as restricting aid to besieged areas. Amos who is due to brief the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday has appealed to the council for more than a year for help in increasing humanitarian access. Diplomats say that it will be tough however for the council to take further action. Russia supported by China has shielded its ally Syria on the Security Council during the war. They had previously vetoed three resolutions that would have condemned Syria's government and threatened it with possible sanctions. BORDER AREAS A representative of an international NGO that works in Syria and neighboring countries said the U.N. "should complement ongoing operations not undermine them." "That's a concern at the moment that a lack of coordination between the U.N. and organizations already working on the ground means they're sometimes doing more harm than good" he said. "Ban Ki-moon's recent report (on aid access) was strong but frustratingly it barely mentioned the challenges that NGOs have faced in delivering aid cross border and cross line in Syria." The report dated April 16 said U.N. agencies are not directly providing critical humanitarian support to millions of Syrians across borders one of the main demands which the Security Council resolution put to Syrian authorities. On March 20 U.N. aid trucks crossed from Turkey into Syria for the first time. But the report said the operation "allowed virtually no assistance to reach civilians in  areas". It said that delays in sharing U.N. plans meant that aid during the cross-border operation was duplicated as other humanitarian groups were also distributing there. There are eight formal border crossings between Syria and Turkey and the one used Qamishli is the only one where there are government forces in the area. Damascus has made clear it will not allow crossings through rebel-held border posts. "We need the help of the U.N. to really scale up that operation and meet the huge demand for help. There are 7 million people living in areas that can only really be accessed with any ease from border countries" the representative said.

Pro-Russian protesters take part in a rally near the seized office of the SBU state security service in Luhansk eastern Ukraine April 27 2014. Mediators held in Ukraine as U.S. readies new Russia sanctions Separatists seize control of TV HQ in east Ukraine city Sun Apr 27 2014 EU courts Moldova with visa-free travel from Monday Sun Apr 27 2014 'Open arms and smile' fail to protect German colonel in Ukraine Sun Apr 27 2014 UK to host international meeting on stolen Ukrainian assets Sun Apr 27 2014 KUALA LUMPUR/SLAVIANSK Ukraine (Reuters) - Pro-Russian rebels paraded European monitors they are holding in eastern Ukraine on Sunday freeing one but saying they had no plans to release another seven as the United States and Europe prepared new sanctions against Moscow. U.S. President Barack Obama called for the United States and Europe to join forces to impose stronger measures to restrain Moscow. The White House said it will add names on Monday of people close to President Vladimir Putin and firms they control to a list of Russians hit by sanctions over Ukraine and also impose new restrictions on high tech exports. The European Union is expected to follow suit by adding to its own list of targeted Russian people and firms but Washington and Brussels have yet to reach agreement on wider measures designed to hurt the Russian economy more broadly. In Donetsk where pro-Russian rebels have proclaimed an independent "people's republic" armed fighters seized the headquarters of regional television and ordered it to start broadcasting a Russian state TV channel. Speaking during a visit to Malaysia Obama said restraining Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions in Ukraine would depend on the United States and its allies finding a unified position on tighter sanctions. "We're going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified and the United States and Europe is unified rather than this is just a U.S.-Russian conflict" Obama told reporters. White House deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the new U.S. measures would be imposed on Monday mostly focused on adding to a list of those barred from travel to the United States and hit by asset freezes. "We will be looking to designate people who are in (Putin's) inner circle who have a significant impact on the Russian economy. We'll be looking to designate companies that they and other inner circle people control" Blinken told CBS television. "We'll be looking at taking steps as well with regard to high-technology exports to their defense industry. All of this together is going to have an impact." The stand-off over Ukraine an ex-Soviet republic of about 45 million people has dragged relations between Russia and the West to their lowest level since the end of the Cold War. After Ukrainians overthrew a pro-Russian president Putin overturned decades of international diplomacy last month by announcing the right to use military force on his neighbor's territory. He has seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and massed tens of thousands of troops on the frontier. Heavily armed pro-Russian gunmen have seized buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Kiev and its Western allies say the uprising is directed by Russian agents. Moscow denies it is involved and says the uprising is a spontaneous reaction to oppression of Russian speakers by Kiev. An international agreement reached this month calls on rebels to vacate occupied buildings but Obama said Russia had not "lifted a finger" to push its allies to comply. "In fact there's strong evidence that they've been encouraging the activities in eastern and southern Ukraine." PRISONERS The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has sent unarmed monitors to try to encourage compliance with the peace deal. The pro-Russian rebels seized eight European monitors three days ago and have been holding them at their most heavily-fortified redoubt in the town of Slaviansk. One a Swede was permitted to leave on Sunday after OSCE negotiators arrived to discuss their release. A separatist spokeswoman said the prisoner had been let go on medical grounds but there were no plans to free the rest. The captives from Germany the Czech Republic Denmark Poland and Sweden were paraded before reporters on Sunday and said they were in good health. "We have no indication when we will be sent home to our countries" the group's leader German Colonel Axel Schneider told reporters as armed men in camouflage fatigues and balaclavas looked on. "We wish from the bottom of our hearts to go back to our nations as soon and as quickly as possible." Germany denounced the appearance and said Moscow must press their captors to free the prisoners. "The public parading of the OSCE observers and Ukrainian security forces as prisoners is revolting and blatantly hurts the dignity of the victims" Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement. "It is an infringement of every rule of behavior and standards that are made for tense situations like this. Russia has a duty to influence the separatists so that the detained members of the OSCE mission are freed as soon as possible." The OSCE a European security body includes Russia. Its main Ukraine mission was approved by Moscow although the Europeans held in Slaviansk were on a separate OSCE-authorized mission that did not require Russia's consent. Vyacheslav Ponomaryov the rebel leader who has declared himself mayor of Slaviansk has described them as prisoners of war and said the separatists were prepared to exchange them for fellow rebels in Ukrainian custody. Washington is more hawkish on further sanctions than some of its European allies which has caused a degree of impatience among some U.S. officials. Many European countries are worried about the risks of imposing tougher sanctions - the EU has more than 10 times as much trade with Russia as the United States and imports about a quarter of its natural gas from Russia. RUSSIA! RUSSIA! At the Donetsk television headquarters about 400 pro-Russian demonstrators chanted "Russia! Russia!" and "Referendum!" - a call for a vote like one in Crimea that preceded its annexation by Russia last month. Four separatists in masks controlled access at the entrance and more masked gunmen in camouflage fatigues could be seen inside. Oleg Dzholos the station's director who came outside to speak to reporters said the people who seized the building had ordered him to change the programming. "They used force to push back the gates" he said. "There were no threats. There were not many of my people. What can a few people do? The leaders of this movement just gave me an ultimatum that one of the Russian channels has to be broadcast." Ponomaryov the rebel leader in Slaviansk said his men had captured three officers with Ukraine's state security service who he said had been mounting an operation against separatists in the nearby town of Horlivka. The Russian television station Rossiya 24 showed footage it said was of a colonel a major and a captain. They were shown seated with their hands behind their backs blindfolded and wearing no trousers. At least two had bruises on their faces. Ukraine's State Security Service said the three had been part of a unit which went to Horlivka to arrest a suspect in the murder of Volodymyr Rybak a pro-Kiev councillor whose body was found last week in a river near Slaviansk.

Cars are seen stuck in a traffic jam on a road near the European Commission headquarters during the morning rush hour in Brussels March 20 2014. BRUSSELS (Reuters) - For two years running Brussels has been named the most congested city in North America and western Europe a mark of shame for the capital that guides Europe's environment and transport policies. The disgrace has however had the effect of uniting Belgium's environmentalist Green Party center-right rivals N-VA and business and motoring groups in a call for a solution whose time may finally have come - charging drivers for distance traveled. Tests have already begun. Others are watching keenly to see what will work in a city the size of Brussels whose issues are different from sprawling megacities like Bangkok or Beijing or London with its central congestion charge. "Since London brought in their congestion scheme technology has come a long way" said Nina Renshaw deputy director of sustainable transport campaign group Transport & Environment. "Today it's possible using GPS (global positioning systems) to have precise billing per kilometer which wasn't possible even 10 years ago" she said. "That makes it much more attractive for cities to consider it." Cities in the Netherlands and Sweden are among those who want to reduce congestion but also cut carbon emissions an effort in which Europe sees itself as setting an example. The European Commission estimates traffic congestion costs at nearly 100 billion euros per year or 1 percent of the European Union's gross domestic product not including the health costs of pollution. The latter has led to the rise of low emission zones in cities from Umea in northern Sweden to Naples in southern Italy. Air pollution from traffic prompted Paris to ban cars with even number plates from entering the city for a day in March. Bruno De Lille Green Party member and mobility secretary for the Brussels region is skeptical his city really is the developed world's capital of congestion as traffic services provider INRIX says but acknowledges his city has some unique problems. One is Belgium's high population density ranked 10th in the world excluding small island or city states such as Malta or Singapore. It also has a tax system that encourages company cars and compensates the cost of driving to work with the former taxed at a lower rate than salaries and the latter able partially to be offset against tax. Moreover more than half of the 650000 people employed in Brussels live outside city limits. Around half of those commute into the city by car a higher proportion than in most European cities. Eurostat data shows the same figure in Amsterdam is 40 percent for example. In Washington DC the percentage is also around 40 percent and for Chicago it is 50 percent according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So far Brussels has tried to fight traffic creep by making public transport more attractive with special bus or tram lanes. That has worked by convincing many commuters to switch to public transport or bicycles but has also created its own problems. "What we've seen in the last 10 years is that we've got 7 percent fewer cars on the roads but the jams have got longer. That's because there's less room for cars" De Lille said. On weekday mornings there are a combined 150-200 km (93-124 miles) of jams on 7000 km of Belgian highways on average according to motorist association Touring. The record set on one day in March last year was 1400 km of jams. THE SOLUTION The most common way of tackling traffic congestion and the pollution it causes has been a congestion zone such as those in place in London Stockholm and Milan. London's 10-pound charge has reduced car traffic by 27 percent since its introduction in 2003. Milan dropped off the top of the INRIX congestion standings after it introduced a charge in 2012. Brussels is considering a combination of steps including a rapid regional rail system along the lines of Paris's RER. "But if we want the cars to move more freely then we have to take another step" De Lille said. The proposal to charge drivers per kilometer traveled is already on trial with around 1000 volunteers in the city and neighboring regions of Flanders and Wallonia. In the trial the volunteers' driving patterns and distances are measured. If they subsequently drive less they are rewarded with cash while activity over the norm is noted. In real life people would be charged electronically or via ticketing for driving during peak hours. The idea is backed by the Flemish separatist party N-VA currently the largest party in parliament albeit balanced against reductions of annual road tax as well as business bodies the Belgian auto federation Febiac and Touring. First public responses have been negative: an online petition opposing the scheme quickly gained over 170000 signatories. In the past decade plans for congestion charges in Manchester and Edinburgh were rejected in referendums. But Transport & Environment says public opinion can shift sharply once road pricing is set up. In Stockholm for example a poll showed very strong support for its congestion charge a year after its launch. Transport & Environment also says that a kilometer charge is a more effective way to cut congestion and emissions than a congestion charge which some users simply get used to. "We prefer the kilometer charges because if you pay a one-off fee you're incentivized to maximize your driving within that period" said Transport & Environment's Renshaw. Jeroen Verhoeven of Bral a group seeking to make Brussels more livable believes a combination of congestion zone and distance charge would be best. With just the former there is no discouragement to drive after taking the one-off hit. With just the latter drivers may still be inclined to make short trips in the city. Joost Kaesemans of Febiac who says he regularly cycles to work says the time lost to traffic jams has doubled in Belgium since 2007. In a report with PwC last year Febiac said cutting traffic by just 5-10 percent could reduce congestion by 40 percent. "Road pricing is a system you can influence yourself. We estimate that 20 percent of the peak-time traffic doesn't have to be there at that time" he said. "Is it for tomorrow? It could take until after 2020 ... but doing nothing is not an option."

"India_turns_to_Russia_to_help_supply_arms_to_Afghan_forces",""Wed_30_Apr_2014_13_20_42_GMT",""reuters.html","India turns to Russia to help supply arms to Afghan forces An Afghan National Army officer stands among tanks before a military exercise on the outskirts of Kabul April 30 2014. NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has signed an agreement under which it will pay Russia to supply arms and equipment to the Afghan military as foreign combat troops prepare to leave the country in a move that risks infuriating Pakistan. Under the deal smaller arms such as light artillery and mortars will be sourced from Russia and moved to Afghanistan. But it could eventually involve the transfer of heavy artillery tanks and even combat helicopters that the Afghans have been asking India for since last year. India has already been training military officers from Afghanistan hosted a 60-member Special Forces group last year in the deserts of Rajasthan and supplied equipment such as combat vehicles and field medical support facilities. But the decision to meet some of Afghanistan's military hardware demands - albeit sourcing them from Russia - points to a deepening role in Afghanistan aimed at preventing it from slipping back into the hands of the Taliban and other Islamist groups that are hostile to India. It comes as China another big player in the region which borders Afghanistan via a small remote strip of land is preparing for a more robust role in Afghanistan also concerned that the withdrawal of NATO troops will leave a hotbed of militancy on its doorstep. Like China India is unlikely to put boots on the ground to reinforce its strategy in Afghanistan. "We can't commit troops on the ground we can't give them the military equipment that they have been asking us for for all sorts of reasons including the lack of surplus stocks" said an Indian foreign ministry official declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. "Involving a third party is the next best option" the official said referring to plans to source military supplies from Russia for Afghan forces. The lack of direct access to Afghanistan poses additional hurdles to arms transfers. An Indian team visited Moscow in February to firm up the deal the official said. The two countries will also help Afghanistan restart an old armaments factory near Kabul and prepare an inventory of Russian military equipment in Afghanistan that could be refitted for use. That dates back to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 although much of the hardware is beyond repair. "We'll work with India directly as well as trilaterally involving Russia" said an Afghan official in New Delhi. "Most of India's weapons are made in Russia or co-produced with Russia so it makes sense. Also the three-way arrangement is cost-effective." Indian officials said they had held talks with China Japan and Iran to find ways to fund Afghan security demands that outgoing President Hamid Karzai told his Indian hosts during a visit last year would touch $4 billion a year. PAKISTAN WARY India's neighbor and rival Pakistan is likely to be angered by any move to help arm Afghan forces even if indirectly. Pakistan shares a long border with Afghanistan and has traditionally exerted considerable influence on Kabul. But under Karzai and since the ouster of the Islamist Taliban movement in 2001 relations have deteriorated amid accusations that Pakistan has failed to stop militants crossing into Afghanistan and launching frequent deadly attacks. Asked about India's plans to supply Russian arms to Afghanistan Pakistani foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said: "I don't have any confirmation so it would be premature to comment on it." A military spokesman did not return calls seeking comment. Ahmed Rashid an author and expert on the region said the deal could aggravate relations between India and Pakistan - nuclear-armed neighbors who have fought three wars - if the arms supplied were heavy enough to be deemed "offensive". "Diplomacy and political dialogue are what will bring peace to Afghanistan" he said. "What is not going to bring peace is more weapons." Russia's Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation the state agency responsible for arms and military cooperation deals declined comment on the agreement. But Alexander Golts an independent Moscow-based defense expert said Russia had a similar arrangement with the United States under which it had delivered Mi-17 helicopters to Afghanistan. The program is now threatened by U.S. sanctions on Russian government officials and firms linked to President Vladimir Putin as punishment for intervention in Ukraine he said. Golts said India and Russia were likely to play a significant role in Afghanistan as coalition troops withdraw. "At the end of the day and despite all the contradictions it's very important for Washington to keep Russia engaged in Afghanistan." Karzai's "shopping list" submitted to New Delhi last year comprised 66 items ranging from tanks to spares for Afghanistan's small fleet of helicopters. Karzai also wanted Indian instructors at the British-funded "Sandhurst in the Sand" military academy built outside Kabul to train Afghan military officers. New Delhi remains opposed to deploying troops including trainers but has increased the number of Afghan officers training in India to nearly 1100 this year from last year's 574. "It is very clear that the Afghan government has been pushing for this especially Karzai to make sure that the ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces) is stocked and has options post-withdrawal" said Rudra Chaudhuri a South Asia specialist at King's College London referring to India's decision to arrange for supplies from Russia. "India's trying to help with Afghan demands but being cautious as well."

"Iran_to_buy_400_airliners_if_sanctions_lifted_top_official_says",""Thu_01_May_2014_11_47_35_GMT",""reuters.html","Iran to buy 400 airliners if sanctions lifted top official says ANKARA (Reuters) - Barred by sanctions from buying Western airliners since the 1970s Iran has pent-up demand for 400 new planes Tehran's top aviation official was reported as saying offering potential billions to manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing. Iran won limited relief from Western sanctions after agreeing to curtail its nuclear activities for six months under an interim accord with world powers which took effect in January. A complete lifting of sanctions would require a comprehensive deal to end a decade-long stand-off over what Tehran maintains is a nuclear program for peaceful energy purposes. "Iranian airlines will be ready to buy 40 passenger planes every year for 10 years if sanctions are lifted" said Ali Reza Jahangirian head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation the Ettelaat newspaper reported on Thursday. The 400 figure confirmed the top end of a range reported by Reuters in November citing a senior Iranian official. Boeing and Airbus which took orders for more than 2800 aircraft from airlines and lessors in 2013 would likely lead the battle for Iran's business. Canada's Bombardier Embraer from Brazil and Russia's Superjet could also secure orders for the smaller airliners they produce along with engine makers GE Aviation and Rolls-Royce. Jahangirian said out of Iran's 250 commercial planes about 150 were flying while the rest are "not functional" due to a lack of spare parts. "We have got very positive signals from Western companies including Boeing Co. and General Electric Co. (GE) about getting new spare parts for our planes" he said. The current preliminary deal allows for the limited sale of commercial plane parts and services to Iran whose fleet includes vintage Boeing and Airbus airliners. GE has won U.S. Treasury approval to service 18 engines sold to Iran in the late 1970s. They will be serviced at facilities owned by GE or Germany's MTU Aero Engines which is licensed to do the work. Iran's four largest carriers - Iran Air Iran Aseman Airlines Mahan Air and Iran Air Tours - all have average fleet ages above 22 years Iranian media have reported. They serve a market of 76 million people in a country whose vast oil and gas reserves could help draw foreign companies once sanctions are lifted. President Hassan Rouhani was elected last year on a promise to improve Iran's relations with the outside world. He has invited Western companies to seize investment opportunities in the Islamic state. Tehran has also repeatedly said it was determined to reach a comprehensive nuclear deal with major powers so it can develop its battered economy. Iran will resume negotiations with the United States Britain France Germany China and Russia in Vienna on May 13 aimed at a long-term deal. The American embassy seizure in Tehran in 1979 led to U.S. sanctions on Iran which have been broadened in the past decade over Iran's perceived nuclear ambitions.

For more information on our comment policy see  Its pretty twisted piece of logic to think Iran would have come to the negotiating table without the kinds of crippling economic sanctions it has suffered from. Years under Ahmadinejad and his crazy talk gave the West the excuse to punish Iran and its religious leadership continued to steer scant resources not to its people but into more nuclear development. How many hospitals could have been built instead of 19000 centrifuges? Then to think Congress should just give up on sanctions as a means of good faith encouragement to a regime that regularly abuses human rights is even more ludicrous. Iran is firmly committed to pursuing an agenda of regional hegemony with a fairly radical interpretation of Islam as its guiding principles. The only proven and sure path to altering Irans behavior has been and should continue to be the punishment of economic sanctions but not just for nuclear issues it should rightly also be placed on improvements in Irans human rights record.

"Malaysia_cites_sensitivities_as_Obama_struggles_to_push_trade_pact",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_09_59_13_GMT",""reuters.html","Malaysia cites 'sensitivities' as Obama struggles to push trade pact U.S. President Barack Obama listens to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak as they participate in a joint news conference at the Perdana Putra Building in Putrajaya April 27 2014. KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Sunday that he and U.S. President Barack Obama had agreed to upgrade bilateral relations but suggested that his country remains far from ready to sign a U.S-led trade pact due to domestic "sensitivities." Obama's visit to Malaysia follows his swing through Japan where he failed to clinch a trade deal key to the U.S. "rebalancing" back to Asia. Such a deal would have injected momentum into the delayed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. Najib's ambition to bring Malaysia into Obama's flagship trade plan has been undercut by the resurgent influence of traditionalists within his own ruling party following a weak election showing last year. Early this month a Malaysian cabinet minister was reported as saying the country was a long way from being able to sign a TPP deal and that the priority should be on economic integration within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc. Najib said Malaysia was committed to free trade and denied that Washington was "bullying" the Southeast Asian nation into joining the controversial pact. "We are working around the sensitivities and challenges which I alluded to in my discussions with President Obama" Najib told a joint news conference with the U.S. leader in the administrative capital of Putrajaya. "He fully understands our domestic sensitivities and we will sit down and try to iron this out with the intention of trying to work out a deal in the near future." Obama said that domestic opposition to trade deals wasn't surprising and that the United States was willing to be flexible on particularly sensitive areas such as prices of life-saving medicines that critics say will jump in countries like Malaysia under the TPP. "There's never been a trade deal in which somebody's not going to at some point object because they're fearful of the future or they're invested in the status quo" Obama said. Protesters briefly disrupted Obama's talk later in the day at a town hall-style meeting with young Malaysians at a university holding up anti-TPP signs before being ushered away by security. "PEACEFUL RISE" FOR CHINA The challenge for Obama during his week-long four-nation regional tour is to convince Asian partners that Washington is serious about its promised strategic "pivot" to increase U.S. influence in Asia without harming U.S. ties with China the world's second-biggest economy and a growing maritime power. In his town hall speech the Hawaiian-born president who lived in Indonesia as a boy told his audience that the United States has long had connections across the Pacific as well as the Atlantic. He told students he plans to meet every year with the leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and would work through the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) to build trade ties. "We want to work with old allies and worthy partners and with China" he said. "We want to see a peaceful rise to China." Najib announced that he had agreed with Obama to upgrade the two countries' ties to a "comprehensive partnership" mirroring a step that Malaysia took with China last year when President Xi Jinping made a state visit. "This marks a new phase in our relationship with greater collaboration in economy security education science technology and more" Najib said. Human rights groups and members of Malaysia's opposition alliance have urged Obama to speak out on what they say has been a sharp deterioration in religious and political freedoms since the ruling coalition suffered its election setback last May. Since then the government has reinstated detention without trial as part of a package of tougher crime laws and renewed what critics call a campaign of judicial persecution against opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. In March a court convicted Anwar on a charge of sodomy and sentenced him to five years in prison. The verdict came days before he was to stand in an election seen as paving the way for him to take charge of Malaysia's richest state. Asked why he would not be meeting Anwar on his three-day visit to Malaysia Obama said it was "not indicative of a lack of concern" and that Malaysia had "work to do" on allowing more freedoms. Obama was due to meet civil society leaders later on Sunday. Najib said he was committed to the rule of law and civil liberties but that he had to take account complex racial sensitivities in the multi-ethnic nation of 29 million people where majority ethnic Malays enjoy special rights. "We have to manage that and that's exactly what Malaysia has done and because of that we are a relatively peaceful harmonious nation" Najib said.

"Abbas_calls_Holocaust_most_heinous_crime_against_humanity",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_11_31_30_GMT",""reuters.html","Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attends a meeting with the Palestinian Liberation Organization's (PLO) central council in the West Bank City of Ramallah April 26 2014. JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the Nazi Holocaust "the most heinous crime" against humanity in modern times in an apparent bid to build bridges with Israel days after troubled peace talks collapsed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the overture on Sunday saying Abbas's Palestinian power-sharing deal with Hamas which led Israel to suspend the negotiations on Thursday put him in partnership with an Islamist group that denies the Holocaust and seeks the Jewish state's destruction. "What I say to him very simply is this: President Abbas tear up your pact with Hamas" Netanyahu said on the CBS news program Face the Nation. Abbas's message published in Arabic and English by the official Palestinian news agency WAFA coincided with Israel's annual remembrance day for the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and included an expression of sympathy for the families of the victims. "What happened to the Jews in the Holocaust is the most heinous crime to have occurred against humanity in the modern era" WAFA quoted Abbas as saying at a meeting a week ago with an American rabbi. By speaking in superlative terms Abbas could risk a backlash from Palestinians who draw comparisons between their suffering at the hands of Israeli occupiers and that of Jews under Hitler's Third Reich. Abbas has condemned the mass killings of Jews in World War Two before and challenged allegations stemming from a 1983 book he authored that he is a Holocaust denier. But the timing of the publication of his latest comments gave them extra significance a day after he signaled he remained committed to the peace talks and said a future Palestinian unity government would recognize Israel. "SHOCKED" On CBS Netanyahu said he and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry "were both shocked" to learn last Wednesday of the reconciliation agreement between Hamas and Abbas's Palestine Liberation Organization. The peace negotiations championed by Kerry were facing an April 29 deadline with little public sign the two sides were making progress toward a U.S.-mediated deal to extend the talks. Netanyahu said in the TV interview however that he had negotiated in earnest for nine months working closely with Kerry and "we made some significant progress". Palestinian officials have blamed Netanyahu for the peace impasse noting he failed to carry out a pledged release of Palestinian prisoners and citing Israeli announcements of further construction in settlements in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu has said Abbas's refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state blocked progress in talks aimed at ending decades of conflict and creating a Palestinian state. The Palestinian unity accord followed seven years of failed reconciliation attempts after Hamas seized the Gaza Strip from forces loyal to Abbas in 2007. The agreement envisages the formation of a Palestinian government of non-political "technocrats" within five months and new elections six months later. On CBS Netanyahu said Abbas "cannot embrace Hamas and say that he wants peace with Israel". In a separate interview with CNN Netanyahu reiterated he would never negotiate with a Palestinian government backed by Hamas a group that both Israel and the United States regard as a terrorist organization. Hamas officials were not immediately available to comment on Netanyahu's Holocaust-denial accusations. But in an open letter to a senior U.N. official in 2009 Hamas branded the Holocaust "a lie invented by the Zionists". Hamas was protesting U.N. plans at the time to start Holocaust studies for children in Gaza. Yad Vashem Israel's national Holocaust memorial gave a guarded welcome to Abbas's statement on Sunday. "Holocaust denial and revisionism are sadly prevalent in the Arab world including among Palestinians" Yad Vashem said. "Thus the statement that the Holocaust is the most heinous crime to have occurred against humanity in the modern era coming from Abbas might signal a change."

Abbas is a fool to suck up to Zonists by apologising for something Palestinians were not responsible for. Abbas needs to realise that Israel will never offer peace no matter how much he sucks up to them. Showing sympathy for an atrocity is not the same as apologizing for it. President Abbas is wisely positioning the State of Palestine on the world stage while Netanyahu has hit bottom for the State of Israel but keeps on digging. Congratulations Palestinians.

The move to ban visas and freeze assets of the likes of Putin's friend Igor Sechin head of oil giant Rosneft also drew fire from President Barack Obama's domestic critics who called it a "slap on the wrist." EU states added 15 more Russians and Ukrainians to their blacklist and will reveal them on Tuesday. The new round of U.S. sanctions following those imposed last month when Russia annexed Crimea barely registered in eastern Ukraine where pro-Moscow rebels were holding a group of German and other OSCE military observers for a fourth day. Despite a Ukrainian military operation to contain them the militants extended their grip by seizing key public buildings in another town in the Donetsk region. In the regional capital Donetsk club-wielding pro-Russian activists broke up a rally by supporters of the Western-backed government in Kiev. The high-profile mayor of Kharkiv Ukraine's second city was badly wounded by a gunman raising fears of further unrest in a Russian-speaking region that has seen less trouble of late than the neighboring provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. U.S. sanctions were aimed Washington officials said at "cronies" of Putin. Seven men including Sechin were targeted by visa bans and freezing of any U.S. assets and 17 companies were also named. "The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally" Obama said. "The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul." Washington will also deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities and revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions the White House said. In addition to Sechin the Russians sanctioned by the United States included another Putin ally Sergei Chemezov head of Rostec a Russian state-owned high-tech products company. The others named were Oleg Belavencev Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea Dmitry Kozak deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation Evgeniy Murov director of Russia's federal protective service Aleksei Pushkov a state Duma deputy and Vyacheslav Volodin a Putin adviser. Not included was Gazprom chief Alexei Miller a close ally of Putin who had been seen as a possible target. Obama is under pressure from opposition Republicans at home to move faster on sanctions. But in taking what he described as "calibrated steps" he has emphasized a need to act in concert with European countries which have more at stake economically and a more cumbersome process for taking decisions. There was little prospect of a change in the calculus for Putin who critics say is stirring up fear among ethnic Russians in order to redraw post-Soviet borders and rebuild Moscow's empire. "Washington is in effect reviving ... an old method of restricting normal cooperation from Cold War times essentially chasing itself into a dark dusty closet of a bygone era" said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov describing the sanctions as illegitimate uncivilized and in breach of international law. In an hour-long phone call with U.S. Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu voiced concern about an "unprecedented" increase in U.S. and NATO activity near Russia's borders and urged Hagel to help "turn down the rhetoric" over Ukraine Moscow's Defense Ministry said. RALLY ATTACKED Both sides continue to offer diametrically mirror-image versions of events in Ukraine. The West sees the pro-Western leaders who took power after Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovich fled to Russia in February as legitimate and believes Putin is trying to undermine their efforts to hold an election. For Moscow they are "fascists" and "putschists" anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalists against whom the Russian speakers of Crimea and the east have risen up in self-defence - a view it broadcasts into Ukraine on state-run Russian media. Opinion polls show substantial but still only minority support in the depressed industrial east of Ukraine for it to follow Crimea into union with Russia. Several people were injured on Monday after dozens of men in military fatigues carrying baseball bats and throwing firecrackers tried to break up a demonstration in Donetsk. A crowd of about 2000 waved Ukrainian flags and chanted: "Donetsk is Ukraine" and "Putin no" but they dispersed after the assault in which Reuters journalists saw at least 10 people treated for head injuries. Earlier in the same region armed men in camouflage who refused to identify themselves seized the police station and town hall in Kostyantynivka. Reuters journalists saw about 20 well-organized gunmen controlling the administration building. They erected a barricade of tires sandbags and concrete blocks. Soviet songs played over loudspeakers and women gathered signatures in support of an uprising against rule from Kiev. Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes a colorful and well-known figure nationwide was shot in the back while out exercising and doctors are battling to save his life. Kernes 54 is a member of the party through which Yanukovich and fellow easterners had dominated a Ukrainian system widely seen as deeply corrupt. Among the most prominent Jewish politicians in the country who earned his wealth from business dealings in the crime-ridden 1990s Kernes had called for Kharkiv to quit Ukraine after Yanukovich fell but had lately clamped down on separatists. The government said police were looking into whether the assassination attempt was linked to the arrest of pro-Russian separatists on Sunday. GERMAN HOSTAGES Although Russia signed a deal with Ukraine and Kiev's U.S. and EU allies at Geneva 10 days ago under which militants should surrender to OSCE monitors it flatly denies Ukrainian and Western assertions it is controlling the militants' activities and that it has special forces orchestrating events on the ground. "Russia's involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable" a White House statement said. After an appeal from Germany long Moscow's firmest advocate in the West for Russia to intervene to secure the release of the seven European monitors four of whom are German Moscow's ambassador to the OSCE said it would be good if they were freed. But he also condemned the OSCE of which Russia is a member for being "extremely irresponsible" in sending them to eastern Ukraine. Moscow has condemned the Kiev authorities for failing to provide security in the industrial and heavily populated east close to the Russian border. In the face of Western and Ukrainian calls for it to pull back troops massed on Ukraine's frontier the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday it had "deep concern" about forces Kiev has sent to the region suggesting that Ukrainian troops might be preparing for "the destruction of entire cities". In the separatist military stronghold at Slaviansk the self-declared mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov said he had given OSCE mediators a list of detainees his movement wanted freed by Kiev in return for the OSCE observers he is holding. The Russian Foreign Ministry said the jailed leader of an earlier separatist protest in Donetsk was on hunger strike to protest against his torture. It also cited reports that Ukraine was building detention centers "very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps" for "dissenting citizens" in the east. The Moscow stock market shrugged off the sanctions rising almost 1 percent when they failed to penalize more companies. Although its chief executive Sechin was hit by a visa ban few expected Rosneft or its international partners to suffer much though its shares lost 1.7 percent on the day. Western countries say sanctions are already having an effect on Russia by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The central bank has raised interest rates to support the ruble and Russian firms are finding it harder to raise funds.

"Obama_Merkel_call_on_pro-Russia_forces_to_stand_down_in_Ukraine",""Fri_02_May_2014_16_41_50_GMT",""reuters.html","Obama Merkel vow wider Russia sanctions if Ukraine election impeded 1 of 2. U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel address a joint news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington May 2 2014. Germany's Merkel: we are ready for sectoral sanctions on Russia 12:41pm EDT WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday the United States would move to "sectoral sanctions" on Russia if Moscow impeded plans for elections in Ukraine later this month. Obama was speaking to reporters at the White House after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel who also supported a move to wider sanctions and said the European Union and the United States would continue to work in concert on the issue. "The next step is going to be a broader-based sectoral sanctions regime" Obama said. Merkel agreed saying that May 25 was a critical date and "we will see to it that elections can take place." The United States and the EU have imposed several rounds of sanctions on individuals and some companies to try to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt any interference in Russian-speaking areas of eastern Ukraine. Energy and banking sectors are two of the most likely areas if those sanctions are widened. "In Europe we have taken a decision that (should) further destabilization happen we will move to a third stage of sanctions. I would like to underline this is not necessarily what we want but we are ready and prepared to go to such a step" Merkel said. Obama said the purpose of sanctions was not to punish Russia but to give it an incentive "to choose a better path." Obama called on Russia to persuade pro-Russian military groups in Ukraine to stand down and said it was disgraceful that the militias were holding international observers. The two leaders said they were united in their desire to impose costs on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and for backing Ukraine including financially. "We're united in our support for Ukraine including the very important IMF program approved this week" Obama said referring to the approval of a $17 billion two-year aid program for Ukraine. He said the Russian account of events in eastern Ukraine that there was a spontaneous uprising by pro-Russian activists was belied by the use on Friday of surface-to-air missiles that brought down two of Ukraine's military helicopters. "It is obvious to the world that these Russian-backed groups are not peaceful protesters. They are heavily armed militants" Obama said.

"Germans_outraged_by_Berlusconi_s_comments_on_concentration_camps",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_14_14_49_GMT",""reuters.html","Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gestures as he appears as a guest on the RAI television show Porta a Porta (Door to Door) in Rome April 24 2014. BERLIN (Reuters) - German politicians on Sunday condemned as "unacceptable" and "absurd" comments by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi that Germans denied the existence of Nazi concentration camps. Social Democrat (SPD) General Secretary Yasmin Fahimi described the comments as "repugnant shocking and completely unacceptable". "These lapses ... not only damage the image of Italy but also endanger the political culture and values of Europe" she told Reuters. She demanded that conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel respond. Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) are allies of Berlusconi's Forza Italia in the European parliament's European Peoples Party conservative grouping. CDU General-Secretary Peter Tauber said the comments were "so absurd that they don't deserve commenting on". Berlusconi said on Saturday: "According to the Germans there never were concentration camps." He caused a storm in 2003 by jokingly offering German Social Democrat Martin Schulz a film part as a concentration camp "kapo" or inmate appointed as an overseer. Social Democrat Schulz told Der Spiegel magazine on Sunday it was also shocking that an Italian sister party of the CDU was campaigning for May's European elections with anti-German slogans such as "More Italy Less Germany". "Such a slogan is outrageous" he said. German conservative Herbert Reul also criticized the slogan saying it was "out of order" and he could not understand it. Anti-German rhetoric has been on the rise in Italy and other heavily indebted euro states since the euro zone crisis led to German demands for economic austerity.

The Foreign Ministry said the EU sanctions imposed on 15 Russian and pro-Moscow Ukrainian officials would not ease tension in Ukraine where the government is struggling to rein in pro-Russian separatists in southeastern regions who it says are backed by Moscow. "Instead of forcing the Kiev clique to sit at the table with southeastern Ukraine to negotiate the future structure of the country our partners are doing Washington's bidding with new unfriendly gestures aimed at Russia" the Foreign Ministry said. "If this is how someone in Brussels hopes to stabilize the situation in Ukraine it is obvious evidence of a complete lack of understanding of the internal political situation ... and a direct invitation for the local neo-Nazis to continue to conduct lawlessness and reprisals against the peaceful population of the southeast" it said in a statement. "Are they not ashamed?" Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said separately that U.S. and EU sanctions were "an absolutely counterproductive trite measure that will force the already critical situation in Ukraine into a dead end" state-run news agency RIA reported. Russia and the West accuse one another of failing to take steps to implement an April 17 agreement to ease tension over Ukraine. Russia retaliated against visa bans and asset freezes imposed following its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region last month but has not yet announced any steps in response to the new sanctions unveiled by the United States and EU this week.

"New_group_CubaNow_tells_Obama_it_s_time_to_change_Cuba_policy",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_17_59_02_GMT",""reuters.html","New group #CubaNow tells Obama it's time to change Cuba policy U.S. President Barack Obama speaks at the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative Town Hall at University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur April 27 2014. MIAMI (Reuters) - A new advocacy group calling for the United States to change its policy toward Cuba launched an advertising campaign on Monday with posters on the Washington D.C. metro system showing President Barack Obama and urging him to "stop waiting." The metro ads by the group #CubaNow are designed to highlight economic changes happening in Cuba. The group believes the 52-year-old U.S. embargo against the communist-ruled island has not worked. "It's time to bring the conversation on U.S.-Cuba policy into the 21st century" said #CubaNow director Ric Herrero. The group said its mission unlike other Cuba policy groups was specifically focused on changing U.S. thinking about Cuba policy. While the group opposes the embargo it recognized that overturning it in Congress is an uphill battle and other ways can be found to change policy such as allowing all Americans to travel to Cuba. "There's plenty the President can do within his existing authority" said #CubaNow founding member Andres Daz a Cuban-born former Obama administration official at the Department of Commerce. #CubaNow was founded by a group of mostly younger generation Cuban Americans. Herrero declined to discuss its funding. The group's launch coincides with the fifth anniversary of Obama's 2009 steps allowing Cuban-Americans to travel freely to visit relatives in Cuba as well as send remittances. That policy shift helped "usher in more change in that time than had been seen in the previous 50 years" the group said in a press release. Herrero said the group based in Miami and Washington wants the White House to take "new steps" to encourage Cuba's burgeoning private sector which has emerged under economic reforms being slowly introduced by the Cuban government. The group's founding is part of a new wave of efforts to prod Obama into taking bolder steps to engage the Cuban government. It follows a February poll by the Atlantic Council which found a majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba. In November Obama told a Miami area fundraiser that it may be time for the United States to "update" its policies toward Cuba. "Blue jeans and rockn roll brought down the Berlin Wall so we have to recognize that there is a new wave of energy pushing a new approach toward U.S.-Cuba policy" said Alex Castellanos a Republican political strategist who is Cuban American.

"Ukraine_blames_Moscow_for_human_shield_detentions_in_east",""Sat_26_Apr_2014_23_22_28_GMT",""reuters.html","1 of 17. An armored personnel carrier is seen near a barricade around the state security service building in Slaviansk April 26 2014. Mediators held in Ukraine as U.S. readies new Russia sanctions Russia offered support in effort to free OSCE monitors: Germany Sat Apr 26 2014 Lavrov tells Kerry U.S. should press Kiev to rein in army Sat Apr 26 2014 SLAVIANSK Ukraine (Reuters) - Pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine offered on Saturday to release eight captive international observers in a prisoner exchange as Western governments prepared new sanctions against Moscow. The pro-Western government in Kiev blamed Russia for what it called the kidnapping on Friday of the monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The separatists said they suspected the observers of spying; Ukraine said they were being used as human shields. Since Ukrainians toppled their pro-Russian president in February Russia has annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and massed tens of thousands of troops on the country's eastern border. NATO has responded by sending reinforcements to eastern Europe in the gravest East-West crisis since the Cold War. Earlier on Saturday the Group of Seven major economies announced they had agreed to impose more sanctions on Russia which they believe is bent on destabilizing its former Soviet neighbor and possibly grabbing more territory. Diplomats said the United States and the European Union were expected to unveil new punitive action against Russian individuals from Monday. Russia denies orchestrating a campaign by pro-Moscow militants who have seized control of public buildings across eastern Ukraine. It accuses the Kiev government of whipping up tensions by sending troops to root out the separatists. The OSCE sent more monitors on Saturday to seek the release of those detained in Slaviansk a city under the separatists' control. Those being held are from Germany Sweden Denmark Poland and the Czech Republic. "COINS TO EXCHANGE" Vyacheslav Ponomaryov de facto mayor of Slaviansk told reporters: "They were soldiers on our territory without our permission of course they are prisoners." He said the separatists were ready to exchange the captured monitors for fellow rebels now in the custody of the Ukrainian authorities. "Prisoners have always been coins to exchange during times of war. It's an international practice" he said. Ukraine's state security service said the OSCE observers - part of a German-led military verification mission deployed since early March at Kiev's request - were being held "in inhuman conditions" and that one needed medical help. A spokeswoman for the Vienna-based organisation of which Russia is a member said the OSCE had been in contact with "all sides" since late on Friday but had had no direct contact with the observers. The Russian foreign ministry said it was working to resolve the crisis but blamed Kiev for failing to ensure the OSCE mission's safety in "areas where the authorities do not control the situation and where a military operation against residents of their own country has been unleashed". Russia's Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper released a video interview with a man it identified as Ivan Strelkov a militia leader in Slaviansk accused by Ukraine's security services of being an employee of Russian intelligence. He suggested the monitors might have been using their diplomatic status "to carry out reconnaissance of the resistance positions for the benefit of the Ukrainian army". It is standard practice for serving military officers to be seconded to OSCE missions. DIPLOMATIC MOVES German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier discussed the Ukraine situation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov by telephone on Saturday "with an accent on possible steps to de-escalate the situation" the Russian ministry said. Steinmeier said Lavrov had offered his backing which he welcomed. In a separate call with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry the Russian minister said Ukraine must halt military operations in the southeast of the country in order to defuse the crisis. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said Russian military aircraft entered Ukrainian airspace seven times overnight. "The only reason is to provoke Ukraine ... and to accuse Ukraine of waging war against Russia" the prime minister told reporters before cutting short a visit to Rome. Washington deployed 150 paratroopers to Lithuania on Saturday. A total of 600 U.S. troops have now arrived in Poland and the former Soviet Baltic states in a bid to reassure nervous NATO allies. "As threats emerged we see who our real friends are" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said as she greeted the troops at the Siauliai air base. Without mentioning Russia she said the presence of U.S. troops would "repel those who encroach on stability in Europe and peace in the region". "The numbers are not important. If just one of our guests is harmed this would mean an open confrontation not with Lithuania but with the United States of America." "DOOR REMAINS OPEN" U.S. officials said new sanctions targeting "cronies" of President Vladimir Putin could be unveiled as early as Monday unless Russia moved fast to defuse the crisis. In a joint statement G7 leaders said Russia had not taken any concrete steps to implement an accord signed earlier this month in Geneva intended to rein in illegal armed groups. "Instead it has continued to escalate tensions by increasingly concerning rhetoric and ongoing threatening military maneuvers on Ukraine's border" it said. "We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia." But it added: "We underscore that the door remains open to a diplomatic resolution of this crisis." Senior EU diplomats will meet on Monday to discuss the next steps and are expected to add 15 more names to a list of Russians subject to asset freezes and a travel ban. Putin acknowledged for the first time this week that sanctions were causing difficulties for Russia though he said the impact was not "critical". Standard & Poor's cut Russia's sovereign long-term debt rating on Friday making it more expensive for the government to borrow money. That forced the central bank to raise its key interest rate to limit a fall in the rouble. Russian banks have been moving funds out of foreign accounts in anticipation of sanctions. Russia has threatened to cut off gas to Ukraine which would have a knock-on effect on customers further west because many pipelines transit the country. Slovakia said on Saturday it had reached an agreement with Ukraine on opening up limited reverse flow of natural gas from central Europe to Ukraine.

Thousands of trade unionists marched with Russian flags and those of Putin's ruling United Russia party onto the giant square beneath the Kremlin walls past the red granite mausoleum of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin. Many banners displayed traditional slogans for the annual workers' holiday such as "Peace Labour May". But others were more directly political alluding to the crisis in Ukraine where Russia's annexation of Crimea in March precipitated the biggest confrontation with the West since the Cold War. "I am proud of my country" read one banner. "Putin is right" said another. In eastern Ukraine where a number of government buildings have been seized by armed groups seeking union with Russia the security situation deteriorated further. Separatists stormed the prosecutor's office in the city of Donetsk throwing rocks firecrackers and teargas at riot police defending officials they accused of working for the Western-backed government in Kiev. Rebels in the city capital of a province of about 4 million people have declared a "People's Republic of Donetsk" and called a referendum on secession for May 11 undercutting a planned presidential election in Ukraine two weeks later. Ukraine's leaders - who came to power in February when the previous Moscow-backed president was toppled after months of protests - conceded on Wednesday they were "helpless" to counter the fall of government buildings and police stations in the Donbass coal and steel belt source of around a third of the country's industrial output. The International Monetary Fund warned that if Ukraine lost territory in the east it would have to redesign a $17 billion bailout of the country probably requiring additional financing. Having seized buildings in the capital of the easternmost province Luhansk on Tuesday gunmen took control at dawn on Wednesday in the nearby towns of Horlivka and Alchevsk. DIPLOMAT EXPELLED Citing the situation in the east acting Ukrainian President Oleksander Turchinov signed a decree reinstating compulsory military service for men aged between 18 and 25. The Kiev government along with its Western allies accuses Moscow of orchestrating the uprising. The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and involvement in eastern Ukraine. Russia denies having any part in the rebellion but has warned it reserves the right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians and has massed tens of thousands of troops on its western frontier with Ukraine. The U.S. and EU sanctions while not hitting Russian industry directly have hurt the economy by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The IMF cut its outlook for Russian economic growth this year to just 0.2 percent on Wednesday and said Russia was already "experiencing recession". U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa said its Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld had canceled plans to attend Putin's St. Petersburg International Economic Forum later this month. A company spokesman confirmed that U.S. officials had urged Alcoa not to send its top executive. Kiev ordered the expulsion of Russia's military attach on Thursday saying it had caught him "red-handed" receiving classified information from a colonel in Ukraine's armed forces on the country's cooperation with NATO. A spokeswoman for Ukraine's security service the SBU said the attach had been handed over to the Russian embassy and ordered to leave though she was not sure if he had left yet. In Moscow Putin unlike Soviet-era leaders did not personally preside at the parade from atop Lenin's mausoleum. But he carried out another tradition from those days by awarding "Hero of Labour" medals to five workers at a ceremony in the Kremlin. He revived the Stalin-era award a year ago. Putin has described the break-up of the Soviet Union as a tragedy and overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy in March by declaring Moscow's right to intervene in former Soviet republics to protect Russian speakers. NATO said on Thursday it was looking at ways to bring former Soviet state Georgia which Russia invaded in 2008 "even closer" to the military alliance. Russian forces defend two breakaway Georgian regions comprising a fifth of its territory. James Appathurai NATO Special Representative for the Caucasus said he would not let Russia's words or actions influence the final decision on whether to make Georgia a full member. Moscow strongly opposes Georgia joining NATO. Last week France and Germany assured Georgia that a deal bringing it closer to the EU would be sealed soon. Romania a former member of the Soviet bloc that now belongs to NATO called on Thursday for the United States and the Western alliance to boost their military presence in the country. This would promote stability in the Black Sea region and "deter any other destabilizing initiatives" the foreign ministry said in a statement. PATRIOTIC UPLIFT Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Rossiya 24 TV that more than 100000 people had marched through Red Square. "This is not by chance because there is a patriotic uplift and a good mood in the country" he said from the square. Russian television also showed footage of a May Day parade in Crimea's capital Simferopol with Russian flags and banners reading "Crimea is Russia. Welcome home." "We are sure that the current patriotic uplift in Crimea will spill over into the whole Russian Federation" Interfax news agency quoted Crimea's pro-Moscow leader Sergei Aksyonov as telling journalists. The intervention in Ukraine has been enormously popular in Russia. One opinion poll on Wednesday showed 82 percent support for Putin his highest rating since 2010. "Western sanctions won't affect us. Crimea was historically part of Russia and it's only right that we've become whole again" said Tatyana Ivanova a worker from Moscow Housebuilding Factory No. 1 celebrating May Day with four colleagues. Putin has also revived the Soviet-era practice of staging massive displays of military firepower on Red Square to mark May 9 the anniversary of the allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two and one of the most important days in the Soviet and Russian calendars. Central Moscow streets have been partially closed in recent days as tanks and mobile rocket launchers rehearse for that parade next week.

"China_to_conduct_naval_drills_with_Russia_in_East_China_Sea",""Wed_30_Apr_2014_18_24_18_GMT",""reuters.html","China to conduct naval drills with Russia in East China Sea BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday it would conduct joint naval drills with Russia in the East China Sea off Shanghai in late May in what it called a bid to deepen military cooperation. China's defense ministry did not give an exact location in the East China Sea where Beijing is locked in an increasingly bitter dispute with Japan over the ownership of a group of uninhabited islets. "These drills are regular exercises held by China and Russia's navies and the purpose is to deepen practical cooperation between the two militaries to raise the ability to jointly deal with maritime security threats" the ministry said on its website. It provided no other details. China alarmed Japan South Korea and the United States last year when it announced an air defense identification zone for the East China Sea covering the islands. The Beijing government which is swiftly ramping up military spending has regularly dispatched patrols to the East China Sea since it established the defense zone. China was angered last week after U.S. President Barack Obama assured ally Japan that Washington was committed to its defense including the disputed isles. Earlier this month Tokyo announced it would break ground on a new radar base in the area on a tropical Japanese island close to Taiwan. The radar station on Yonaguni Island just 150 km (93 miles) from the disputed islands in the East China Sea marks Japan's first military expansion at the western end of its island chain in more than 40 years. China and Russia have close diplomatic security and economic ties and regularly carry out military exercises together.

So is the number of unemployed. The size of your paycheck and the number of childbirths is shrinking. The middle class is getting squeezed. The moral fiber of this country has been shredded. Our military strung out all over the place has been castrated by politics. People are drowning in debt and our healthcare system is in shambles (regardless of what the leftist media tells you).

Russia is all butt-hurt about those useless sanctions imposed by Americas president. I havent run the numbers on Russian and Chinese military lately but Ill bet a box of Shipleys chocolate-iced donuts theyre in better shape than America is. Yeah we got the nukes if it comes down to *real* nut-cuttin but I dont see the Messiah pushing the button. Thats not to say if some unforeseen circumstance puts the finger of Joe Biden Professional Idiot on it that he wont push it. Hes just retarded enough to do it. So what do we have? US troops still tied up in the Middle East and some now in Poland and those scattered about willy-nilly in other foreign bases such as the 38th Parallel which will give Porky Kim the excuse to create a diversion by vaporizing Seoul (with Chinas blessing). Let the games begin! China & Russia under the guise of conducting drills obliterate the rest of the peninsula as well as Japan. Sleeper cells in the US backed by the Dynamic Duo set off suitcase nukes in strategic locations. What? Suitcase nukes. Small (1 kiloton) portable bang-bangs tat could make a god-awful mess if detonated. Remember back in the late 90s when 100 were reportedly missing? You dont? Google missing russian suitcase nukes then. No sense in sending missiles as that would only ruin a lot of good real estate as well as risk nuclear retaliation. There wouldnt even be the need to invade thus sparing more unnecessary expense. Lets seewhat would be good targets? New York of course. Los Angeles just for a good body count if nothing else. Nuclear power plants to make a nice mess and turn off some lights. Refineries of coursecan get around too well without oil and gasoline. DC is a given. Military posts too. Larger electrical generating plants. Oooh! The Hoover Dam! That would be a sight to see. This could all be carried out easily over a period of just a few days and bring America to a screeching halt. China and Russia are members of the SCO a military economic and political alliance with 4 central Asian lands. They will watch Afghanistan after the US and NATO leave. They have conducted joint police military and naval exercises to prepare. China and Russia conducted a similar naval exercise in the Peter the Great Bay that opens into the Sea of Japan near Vladivostok about six months ago. Fourteen Russian and eight Chinese warships conducted maneuvers and firing exercises and these planned naval maneuvers will likely be similar. Chinas first ADIZ is much smaller than the vast network of US ADIZs that have been in place since WWII. One purpose is to defend against terrorist attacks similar to 9-11 using inbound airliners. The US chooses to oppose Chinas growth but this enables China to develop its own tactics for using ADIZs without interference.

"U.S._warns_of_South_Sudan_genocide_risk_raises_hope_of_new_forces",""Thu_01_May_2014_21_05_26_GMT",""reuters.html","U.S. warns of South Sudan genocide risk raises hope of new forces U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry addresses a news conference during his official visit to Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa May 1 2014. ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned on Thursday that South Sudan's conflict could descend into genocide as he renewed threats of sanctions and raised hope that more peacekeeping forces could be deployed swiftly to halt the bloodshed. Kerry emerging from talks about the increasingly ethnic slaughter in South Sudan with foreign ministers from neighboring Ethiopia Uganda and Kenya said all sides agreed the "killing must stop." "A legitimate force that has an ability to help make peace needs to get on the ground as rapidly as possible" Kerry said in Addis Ababa at the start of an African trip. Addressing reporters later Kerry said the goal was "in these next days literally we can move more rapidly to put people on the ground who could begin to make a difference." His Ethiopian counterpart Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom said all sides stressed the need for deployment of a force "as soon as possible." A spokeswoman said Kerry was referring to regional forces under the authority of the United Nations which already has a mission in South Sudan. Kerry said he and his African counterparts agreed on "the terms and timing and manner and size" of such a force but declined to offer details. "The greatest single difference will be moving rapidly with U.N. Security Council imprimatur of support to get forces on the ground who could begin to separate people and provide safety and security. That's imperative" Kerry told reporters. More than 1 million people have fled their homes and thousands of people have been killed since fighting erupted in December between troops backing President Salva Kiir and soldiers loyal to his sacked deputy Riek Machar. The fighting has exacerbated ethnic tensions between Kiir's Dinka people and Machar's Nuer. Negotiations between the Kiir government and rebels loyal to Machar have failed to advance since the January 23 signing of a ceasefire that never took hold. TROUBLING QUESTIONS Asked about the risk of genocide Kerry said "very disturbing leading indicators of the kind of ethnic tribal targeted nationalistic killings" raised troubling questions. "Were they to continue in the way that they have been going (they) could really present a very serious challenge to the international community with respect to the question of genocide" he told reporters. Delegations from both sides in South Sudan resumed face-to-face discussions in Addis Ababa on Thursday after several delays officials said. A senior State Department official speaking to reporters traveling with Kerry ahead of the trip said regional powers were losing patience with the inability of both sides in South Sudan to move forward with peace efforts. "I think both sides think that they can win this militarily and they have certainly not participated in any committed way to finding a negotiated settlement for the conflict" the official said speaking on condition of anonymity. Kerry also renewed U.S. threats of sanctions and said regional partners Uganda Kenya and Ethiopia also "accepted the responsibility for also doing sanctions." U.S. lawmakers are also pushing the Obama administration to do more. A group of nine Democratic and Republican senators wrote to President Barack Obama on Thursday urging him to impose sanctions on those responsible for human rights abuses work to strengthen the mandate of the U.N. South Sudan mission and hold Kiir and Machar accountable for progress in peace negotiations. Many South Sudanese own property in the three neighboring countries and regularly travel there the State Department official said. Obama earlier this month authorized possible targeted sanctions against those committing human rights abuses in South Sudan or undermining democracy and obstructing the peace process. Still Kerry held out hope that talks might sway the course of events in South Sudan and pointed to Kiir's decision last week to release four political prisoners. "We are hoping that now opens up the possibility of a mediation and dialogue that could take place anywhere in the next few days" he said.

New U.S. and EU sanctions packages announced with fanfare were seen as so mild that Russian share prices rose in relief. A small number of names were added to existing blacklists while threats to take more serious measures were put on hold. Nevertheless Russian President Vladimir Putin responded by threatening to reconsider Western participation in energy deals in Russia the world's biggest oil producer where most major U.S. and European oil companies have extensive projects. Demonstrators smashed their way into the provincial government headquarters in Luhansk Ukraine's easternmost province which abuts the Russian border and raised separatist flags over the building while police did nothing to interfere. As night fell about 20 rebel gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons and threw stun grenades at the headquarters of the region's police trying to force those inside to surrender their weapons a Reuters photographer at the scene said. "The regional leadership does not control its police force" said Stanislav Rechynsky an aide to Interior Minister Arsen Avakov referring to events in Luhansk. "The local police did nothing." The rebels also seized the prosecutor's office and the television center. The separatist operation in Luhansk appears to give the pro-Moscow rebels control of a second provincial capital. They already control much of neighboring Donetsk province where they have proclaimed an independent "People's Republic of Donetsk" and declared a referendum on secession for May 11. The rebels include local youths armed with clubs and chains as well as "green men" - heavily armed masked men in military uniforms without insignia. Adding control of Luhansk would give them sway over the entire Donbass coalfield - an unbroken swath of territory adjacent to Russia - where giant steel smelters and heavy plants account for around a third of Ukraine's industrial output. It is the heart of a region that Putin described earlier this month as "New Russia" reviving a term from when the tsars conquered it in the 18th and 19th centuries. Most people who live in the area now identify themselves as Ukrainians but speak Russian as their first language. MOSCOW ACCUSED Ukraine a country of 45 million people the size of France has a thousand-year history as a state but has spent much of the last few centuries under the shadow of its larger neighbor. It emerged as a modern independent nation after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 with borders drawn up by Bolshevik commissars from territory previously ruled by Russia Poland and Austria. Its current crisis erupted after a pro-Russian president was toppled in February in a popular uprising. Within days Putin had declared the right to use military force and dispatched his undercover troops to seize Crimea. The United States and European Union accuse Moscow of directing the uprising with the intent of dismembering Ukraine. "Today Russia seeks to change the security landscape of eastern and central Europe" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a speech on Tuesday. "Whatever path Russia chooses the United States and our allies will stand together in our defense of Ukraine." Nevertheless U.S. and European officials have repeatedly made clear they will not consider military action. The U.S. embassy in Kiev described the behavior of pro-Russian activists - who also attacked a rally of Kiev supporters on Monday with clubs and iron bars and are holding dozens of hostages including seven unarmed European military monitors - as "terrorism pure and simple". U.S. President Barack Obama announcing new sanctions on Monday said they were intended to change Putin's "calculus". But so far they have shown no sign of restraining the Kremlin leader who overturned decades of post-Cold War diplomacy last month to seize and annex Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula and has since massed tens of thousands of troops on the frontier. Russia has openly threatened to invade to protect Russian speakers though it denies that it plans to do so. Putin threatened on Tuesday to review the role of Western firms in Russian energy deals. "We would very much wish not to resort to any measures in response. I hope we won't get to that point" Putin told reporters after meeting leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan. "But if something like that continues we will of course have to think about who is working in the key sectors of the Russian economy including the energy sector and how." Russia's RTS stock index rose 1.23 percent on Tuesday in relief that the latest EU and U.S. sanctions were so modest. BLACKLISTS After Russia took Crimea in March Washington and Brussels each drew up sanctions blacklists that ban travel by and freeze the assets of individuals and firms deemed to have played a role in threatening Ukraine. The EU added 15 Russians and pro-Russian Ukrainians to its blacklist on Tuesday a day after Washington added seven individuals and 17 firms to its own list. But neither list includes any of Russia's major firms. The latest U.S. list names Igor Sechin a long-time Putin ally who now heads Russia's biggest oil company Rosneft. But the firm said the blacklisting of its boss would not affect its operations including plans to buy the oil trading arm of Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley. Sechin's name was conspicuously left off the EU list. European countries do more than 10 times as much trade with Russia as the United States buying a quarter of their natural gas from Moscow. They have been slower than Washington to embrace sanctions that might jeopardize trade. Moscow has shrugged off the blacklists as pointless though Washington and Brussels say they have had an indirect economic impact by scaring investors into withdrawing capital. "You have to look over the period of time Russia went into Crimea; since we've imposed sanctions there has been a quite substantial deterioration in Russia's already weak economy" U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told congressional hearings. "We see it in their stock exchange we see it in their exchange rate we see it in a number of important economic indicators." Lew said Washington could also impose wider sanctions on Russian industry. Obama said on Monday Western countries were keeping that option "in reserve" in case of further escalation. A hostage drama has kept the issue on the boil in European capitals. On Friday rebels captured eight unarmed European military monitors. A Swede was freed three days later but four Germans a Dane a Czech and a Pole are still held in Slaviansk a town rebels have turned into a heavily fortified redoubt. The self-declared "people's mayor" of the town Vyacheslav Ponomaryov said on Tuesday he would discuss their release only if the EU dropped sanctions against rebel leaders. "If they fail to remove the sanctions then we will block access for EU representatives and they won't be able to get to us. I will remind my guests from the OSCE about this" he said referring to the European hostages. Nevertheless he later met OSCE representatives and said they had made "good progress" in discussions on the release of the captives. Ukraine's authorities are struggling to find a way to evict the separatists who also took a small town hall in Pervomaisk in the Luhansk region on Tuesday and a number of buildings in another city on Monday. Kiev launched an "anti-terrorist" operation in early April but it has yielded little so far. The Russian Foreign Ministry said the EU sanctions would not ease tensions in Ukraine. "Instead of forcing the Kiev clique to sit at the table with southeastern Ukraine to negotiate the future structure of the country our partners are doing Washington's bidding with new unfriendly gestures aimed at Russia" the ministry said. Gennady Kernes the mayor of eastern Ukraine's biggest city Kharkiv was in a stable condition on Tuesday in a hospital in Israel where he was flown after an assassination attempt. Kernes was shot in the back on Monday.

"U.S._sanctions_companies_from_China_Dubai_for_dealings_with_Iran",""Tue_29_Apr_2014_13_21_36_GMT",""reuters.html","U.S. offers $5 million for Chinese businessman accused of Iran dealings A general view of an oil dock is seen from a ship at the port of Kalantari in Iran January 17 2012. Iran's Rouhani suggests critics benefited from sanctions Tue Apr 29 2014 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States offered a reward of up to $5 million on Tuesday for a Chinese businessman accused of supplying missile parts to Iran and targeted companies from China and Dubai for allegedly helping Iran evade weapons and oil sanctions. In a signal Washington will keep pressure on Iran over its nuclear program the U.S. Treasury Department said it was sanctioning eight of Chinese businessman Li Fangwei's Chinese companies for allegedly procuring missile parts for Iran. The U.S. State Department said it was offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Li who is also known as Karl Lee. Li has been the target of U.S. sanctions in the past for his alleged role as a principle supplier to Iran's ballistic missile program. The State Department said the announcement of the bounty for Li was coordinated with Treasury and the Justice Department which unsealed an indictment against him on charges including conspiracy to commit money laundering bank fraud and wire fraud. "According to the Indictment he (Li) controls a large network of front companies and allegedly uses this network to move millions of dollars through U.S.-based financial institutions to conduct business in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations which prohibit such financial transactions" the State Department said in a statement. Treasury also said it was targeting a firm based in Dubai and several associated individuals for helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions against its oil industry. Iran and a group of world powers reached a temporary deal in November under which Tehran would get about $7 billion in sanctions relief in return for steps to restrain its nuclear activities. The deal called for negotiation of a full agreement within a year and Treasury said on Tuesday it was still pressing for a more definitive resolution. "We will continue vigorously to enforce our sanctions even as we explore the possibility of a comprehensive deal addressing Iran's nuclear program" Treasury Under Secretary David Cohen who oversees sanctions policy said in a statement. A United Nations report said earlier this month that Iran has acted to cut its most sensitive nuclear stockpile by nearly 75 percent making clear Tehran is undertaking the agreed steps to curb its nuclear program. A U.S. official however told Reuters last month Iran had pursued a longstanding effort to buy banned components for its nuclear and missile programs in recent months even while it was striking an interim deal with major powers to limit its disputed atomic activity. Vann Van Diepen principal deputy assistant secretary of state for international security and non-proliferation added that Li had continued to supply such items despite U.S. pressure on China to tighten export controls. Contacted by Reuters on Feb 4 2013 for an earlier story about his business Li said he continued to get commercial inquiries from Iran but only for legitimate merchandise. Li said his metals company LIMMT had stopped selling to Iran once the United States began sanctioning the firm several years ago. China has said that it is very clear in its stance on non-proliferation and that it has seriously fulfilled its obligations to U.N. resolutions about export controls.

For more information on our comment policy see  It seems that the US government is not short of money at all as it still has manpower monitoring across the globe for this sort of sanction activities. But why it was at the verge of shutting down last year? I dont understand American politics and financial management. Of course the government has money it flows freely out of a printer. The US is provoking more anger at a time when we could do with less. It is all a desperate attempt to save the dollar and its privilege as the reserve currency. Everything is coming to a head and soon it will be on on like Donkey Kong! Iran has repeatedly ignored U.S. and United Nations demands to curtail the nuclear development needed to build weapons of mass destruction. Instead Iran has been caught several times cheating or building secret nuclear sites. Irans Natanz and Fordow nuclear-fuel enrichment plants were both built in secret. In May 2011 the International Atomic Energy Agency warned of Iranian efforts involving the removal of the conventional high-explosive payload from the warhead of the Shahab-3 missile and replacing it with a spherical nuclear payload. Ask yourselfWhy would a country that is not trying to build a nuclear bomb even try to fit a nuclear payload onto a missile? Based on Irans history of lies deception and hostility why should we believe they are playing square now? Giving Iran $7 billion( pluse 1 billion more) in cash while leaving in place one of the most sophisticated enrichment programs in the world is not an act of good faith; it is an act of appeasement.

"Putin_foe_Navalny_avoids_detention_during_new_Russian_trial",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_15_51_31_GMT",""reuters.html","Opposition leader Alexei Navalny talks to the media after leaving a justice court building in Moscow April 22 2014. MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court rejected a request by prosecutors to put Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny behind bars during a second trial on theft charges leaving one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics under house arrest. Navalny who is serving a five-year suspended sentence on a theft conviction he says was Putin's revenge for his opposition could be jailed for years if found guilty of stealing more than 30 million roubles ($840200) from two companies through fraud. But the judge's decision to prolong his house arrest instead of moving him to a detention facility as prosecutors and prison authorities had requested suggests the Kremlin is concerned that jailing him could cause protests. After gaining prominence with an on-line crusade against the corruption that he says permeates Putin's government Navalny emerged from a wave of street protests in 2011-2012 as Russia's most popular opposition leader. The initial theft conviction prevents Navalny 37 from running for office for years. He startled the Kremlin with a strong second-place showing in a Moscow mayoral election last year. Putin weathered the protests to win a third presidential term in 2012 and critics say the legal pressure on Navalny is part of a intensified clampdown on dissent since his return to the Kremlin. Putin denies he interferes in court cases. (Writing by Steve Gutterman; Editing by Angus MacSwan ) Comments (0) This discussion is now closed.

"Obama_says_U.S._commitment_to_defend_Philippines_ironclad",""_Tue_29_Apr_2014_04_17_33_GMT",""reuters.html","1 of 3. U.S. President Barack Obama speaks to military troops at the Fort Bonifacio Gymnasium in Manila April 29 2014. U.S. removes Philippines from piracy watch list after 20 years Tue Apr 29 2014 MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday a new military pact between the United States and the Philippines is testimony to America's "ironclad" commitment to defend the southeast Asian nation. The U.S. president's comments came against the backdrop of tensions between the Philippines and an increasingly powerful China over remote uninhabited islands in the South China Sea. "Our commitment to defend the Philippines is ironclad and the United States will keep that commitment because allies never stand alone" Obama said. Sweating profusely in an unairconditioned gymnasium packed with U.S. and Filipino soldiers veterans and their families the president said joint U.S.-Filipino rescue efforts after November's Typhoon Yolanda were the modern-day version of the bravery shown by both country's troops during World War Two. The military agreement between the two countries was the centerpiece of Obama's first visit to the Philippines the United States' oldest ally in the region. The deal which will have an initial 10-year term sets the framework for a beefed-up rotation of U.S. troops ships and warplanes through the Philippines. Obama said the accord and his visit - part of a four-nation swing through Asia - demonstrated the U.S. commitment to a "rebalancing" of resources and diplomacy towards the fast-growing region. That commitment has been in doubt as the United States has focused on conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan. "Deepening our alliance is part of our broader vision for the Asia Pacific" Obama said. The U.S. president further stressed solidarity with the Philippines as Manila seeks international arbitration over disputed islands in a tense standoff with Beijing. "International law must be upheld. Freedom of navigation must be preserved" Obama said. "Disputes must be resolved peacefully and not by intimidation or by force." China claims most of the South China Sea but the Philippines Malaysia Vietnam Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims to parts of those waters. Earlier this month a small Philippine government ship needed to evade a blockade of Chinese coastguard vessels to deliver food water and fresh troops to a disputed shoal in the Spratly Islands. The Philippines is seeking United Nations arbitration challenging China's "nine-dash-line" that stretches deep into the South China Sea and the maritime heart of Southeast Asia. In the sweltering Fort Bonifacio gymnasium on Tuesday the U.S. president peeled off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves to speak apologizing to the assembled uniform-clad troops for doing so but promising to make his remarks brief. Afterwards he shook hands with troops and veterans posing for a "selfie" photo with the family of one of the Filipino veterans. The president later toured and laid a wreath at the U.S. military cemetery in Manila where both U.S. and Filipino soldiers are buried. The cemetery contains more than 17000 graves of U.S. service members who died during World War Two the largest such cemetery anywhere in the world. Obama's visit to the Philippines was the final leg of was on the final day of a tour that also took him to Tokyo Seoul and Kuala Lumpur.

"Putin_foes_fear_Internet_crackdown_as_blogger_law_sails_through",""Tue_29_Apr_2014_15_29_22_GMT",""reuters.html","Putin foes fear Internet crackdown as 'blogger law' sails through Members of the Federation Council Russia's upper house of parliament stand before a session in Moscow March 21 2014. MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's upper house of parliament approved a law on Tuesday that will impose stricter rules on bloggers and is seen by critics as an attempt by President Vladimir Putin to stifle dissent on the Internet. The Federation Council overwhelmingly approved the tighter controls on Russian blogs and websites that attract more than 3000 daily visits under legislation the government says is needed to formalize the definition of blogging in Russian law. Opponents say the law will enable Putin to silence opponents who are rarely given air time on the mostly state-controlled or pro-Putin television channels and have instead used the Internet to organize protests against the former KGB spy. "The new policy is to restrict free information exchange restrict expression of opinion be it in written text speech or video. They want to restrict everything because they're headed towards the 'glorious past'" Anton Nosik a prominent Russian blogger and online media expert told Reuters. "China is much more liberal than what Russia wants to achieve" he said describing the move as unconstitutional. The pressure group Reporters Without Borders (RWB) said the law was an attempt to increase control of online content. The State Duma lower house has already backed the law and it now needs Putin's signature to go into force. Both chambers are dominated by the United Russia party loyal to the president. The new rules will require popular bloggers to register by name with Russia's communications oversight agency and conform to regulations on the mass media. The Kremlin denies allegations of censorship or pressure on the media and says Russians have the right to express their opinions and stage protests. CIA PROJECT But Putin has described the Internet as a CIA project and parliament has approved moves requiring social media websites to keep their servers in Russia and save information about users for at least six months. With 61 million users Russia is Europe's fastest-growing Internet audience according to a 2013 report by industry body comScore and blogs have been seen by Putin's opponents as one of the few popular platforms beyond the Kremlin's reach. The editor of a popular Internet news site Lenta.ru was dismissed this year and independent TV Dozhd has gone off the air. The head of VKontakte Russia's answer to Facebook has been ousted and fled the country. The government has also blocked access to the Internet sites of Kremlin critics Alexei Navalny and Garry Kasparov because they "contained calls for illegal activity". Navalny was one of the leaders of the anti-Putin protests of 2011-12 which were organized largely through social media sites and blogs. Navalny has further used his own blog to highlight state corruption and undermine United Russia in a campaign that helped establish him as an opposition leader. Russia's leading blog platform LiveJournal appears to be standing up to the new rules. The day after the blogging law was approved by the lower house LiveJournal director Dmitry Pilipenko said the site would no longer display the number of subscribers a blog had if the figure exceeded 2500. Pilipenko said "all coincidences are accidental" but the timing of the announcement means many have seen the decision as a bid to protect LiveJournal's users. The decision followed a similar move by Russia's biggest search engine Yandex. These steps will not stop Russia's media watchdog monitoring popular bloggers as it can obtain information on readership statistics independently Roscomnadzor head Alexander Zharov said. "LiveJournal and Yandex's move to hide blog statistics is just an emotional decision" local media quoted Zharov as saying.

"Berlusconi_says_surreal_to_suggest_he_is_anti-German",""Mon_28_Apr_2014_16_00_03_GMT",""reuters.html","Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gestures as he appears as a guest on the RAI television show Porta a Porta (Door to Door) in Rome April 24 2014. ROME (Reuters) - Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi denied on Monday that he was anti-German after he caused outrage at the weekend by suggesting Germany did not acknowledge the existence of Nazi concentration camps. The politician said his leftwing opponents had taken out of context a comment he had made about Martin Schulz a German who is president of the European Parliament and the center left's candidate to be the next European Commission chief. "It's surreal to attribute to me any anti-German sentiment or a presumed hostility towards the German people with whom I am friends" Berlusconi said in a statement. At a campaign rally on Saturday Berlusconi described Schulz whom he once compared to a concentration camp overseer as unfriendly to Italy. He then added: "According to the Germans there never were concentration camps. The latest in a long line of off-color quips from the 77-year-old billionaire has fed into the European parliamentary election campaign in which Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia party has adopted a marked anti-German tone. Trailing both Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's center-left Democratic Party and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement in the polls ahead of the next month's election the party has blamed German Chancellor Angela Merkel for forcing Italy to adopt harsh austerity measures. One of its campaign slogan says: "More Italy less Germany". "If I'm hostile to anything it's to counter-productive austerity to certain restrictions and rules which in my opinion are seriously mistaken and which are trapping the whole of Europe in a long economic stagnation" Berlusconi's statement said. Jean-Claude Juncker the candidate for European Commission chief put forward by the European People's Party the center-right group that includes Forza Italia called on Berlusconi to withdraw his remarks about concentration camps saying he was "disgusted" by them.
