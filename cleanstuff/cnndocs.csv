FBI: William James Vahey taught at private schools in 9 countries for 42 years He's one of "the most prolific alleged predators we've ever seen" agent tells KPRC Thumb drive allegedly contained images depicting sexual assault on children FBI is asking potential victims to contact them or nearest American Embassy (CNN) -- An alleged child predator who taught at schools across the world for more than four decades may have more victims and the FBI is trying to track them down the agency's Houston bureau said Tuesday. William James Vahey killed himself in Luverne Minnesota last month two days after a federal judge in Houston said authorities could search one of Vahey's thumb drives that allegedly contained images depicting sexual assault on children CNN affiliate KPRC reported . There were images of at least 90 victims dating back to 2008 and the FBI is encouraging additional alleged victims to come forward. The images on the thumb drive allegedly belonging to Vahey showed boys estimated to be between 12 and 14 years old asleep or unconscious the agency said. The images had captions and dates referencing places that Vahey had previously traveled with students the FBI said. "This is one of the most prolific alleged predators we've ever seen" Houston FBI Special Agent Shauna Dunlap told the station . Vahey began teaching in private schools in 1972 the FBI says. He last taught at the American Nicaraguan School in Pista Suburbana Managua Nicaragua from August 2013 until March 11 two days before he committed suicide KPRC reported. The case came to law enforcement attention after Vahey fired his maid for allegedly stealing personal items from his home last year KPRC said. In March the ex-maid brought a stolen thumb drive to the American Nicaraguan School saying she came forward because the drive contained sexual images the station reported. The FBI said that when Vahey was confronted with the images he " reportedly admitted molesting boys throughout his entire life and said he gave the minors sleeping pills prior to the molestation." He had residences in London and Hilton Head Island South Carolina and traveled extensively the FBI said. He worked at schools in nine countries teaching a variety of subjects and coaching boys' basketball. He regularly accompanied students on overnight field trips the FBI said. The schools where he taught are according to the FBI: -- American Nicaraguan School in Managua Nicaragua (2013-2014) -- Southbank International School in London United Kingdom (2009-2013) -- Escuela Campo Alegre in Caracas Venezuela (2002-2009) -- Jakarta International School in Jakarta Indonesia (1992-2002) -- Saudi Aramco Schools in Dhahran Saudi Arabia (1980-1992) -- American Community School in Athens Greece (1978-1980) -- Passargad School in Ahwaz Iran (1976-1978) -- American School of Madrid in Spain (1975-1976) -- American Community School of Beirut in Lebanon (1973-1975) -- Tehran American School in Iran (1972-1973) Anyone who has information on Vahey and who believes he victimized them can send a confidential e-mail to  or contact their local FBI office or nearest U.S. Embassy.

Also the departments of Commerce and State are tightening their "policy to deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russia's military capabilities. Those Departments also will revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions" the White House said. Russia: The U.S. won't 'impress its cronies' Sergey Ryabkov Russia's deputy minister for foreign relations called the sanctions "meaningless shameful and disgusting." "It will only intensify all the processes in Ukraine which it intends to change or stop" Ryabkov told CNN speaking English. "It is yet another sign of a reckless behavior of the U.S. administration. No lessons are learned from the past. The U.S. does literally nothing to impress its cronies and clients in Kiev on whom there is full responsibility for constant deterioration of the situation in Ukraine. This is what needs to be changed and not the policy of Russia. "A response of Moscow will follow and it will be painfully felt in Washington D.C." A senior Ukrainian government official called the new sanctions "a very good step but we hope it's not the final step. Sector sanctions would be the really painful measure." The sanctioned include a Putin 'trusted ally' The seven officials named are: -- Oleg Belavantsev Russia's envoy to Crimea. -- Sergei Chemezov who oversees Russia's high-tech sector as head of state-owned corporation Rostec and is "a trusted ally of Putin" according to the White House. -- Dmitry Kozak deputy prime minister. -- Evgeniy Murov director of Russia's Federal Protective Service. -- Aleksei Pushkov deputy of the State Duma. -- Igor Sechin president of Russia's leading petroleum company Rosneft. -- Vyacheslav Volodin Putin's first deputy chief of staff one of the advisers who encouraged Putin to move into Crimea according to the White House. Obama: This isn't personal Earlier speaking to reporters in Manila Philippines Obama praised the Ukrainian government for abiding by its agreements made in Geneva and operating "in good faith." The goal of the new sanctions he said is not to go after Putin personally but "to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul -- and to encourage him to actually walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to diplomatically resolving the crisis." "There are specific steps that Russia can take. And if it takes those steps then you can see an election taking place in Ukraine; you can see the rights of all people inside of Ukraine respected." If the latest round of sanctions don't work the next phase could target sectors such as banking Obama said. EU sanctions coming The European Union also is expected to impose sanctions Monday on about 15 Russian officials who are believed to be undermining democracy and creating chaos in Ukraine according to Western diplomats. The sanctions will include asset freezes and travel bans. The EU is not expected to impose sanctions on Putin associates in part because the European judiciary system has a much higher bar in terms of applying the law the diplomats said. Judges are not able to look at intelligence to sign off on the sanctions they said. One Western diplomat said there was also some division within the EU as to whether sanctions against Putin's cronies should be imposed. Several European countries are also concerned that their economic interests would be greatly affected by such sanctions. Additionally some countries feel more space should be given to diplomacy before such measures are considered the diplomat said. Neither the United States nor EU is ready to impose sanctions on Russian industries like the energy sector both U.S. officials and Western diplomats said. "Today's targeted actions taken in close coordination with the EU will increase the impact we have already begun to see on Russia's own economy as a result of Russia's actions in Ukraine and from U.S. and international sanctions" U.S.Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in a statement. "Russian economic growth forecasts have dropped sharply capital flight has accelerated and higher borrowing costs reflect declining confidence in the market outlook."

See the crisis in Ukraine before Crimea voted Ukraine's government is running out of options for restoring its control of eastern regions Many government and police buildings are still held by pro-Russian protesters Constitutional reforms are still being thrashed out CNN looks as possible scenarios that could unfold between now and the May 25 elections (CNN) -- Ukraine's young government is running out of viable options for restoring its control of eastern regions and preserving the country's territorial integrity. Government and police buildings in more than a dozen places are still held by pro-Russian protesters sometimes led by masked and well-armed men in uniform. The response from Kiev to this assault has been inconsistent and hesitant. Amid a war of words between Washington and Moscow the "agreement" reached in Geneva last week for resolving the crisis looks dead in the water. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of bad faith and on the ground there is a growing sense of stalemate interrupted by episodes of violence that only harden views. Just one month before the Ukrainian presidential election constitutional reforms that might mollify the pro-Russian protesters are still being thrashed out. The Geneva agreement called on the protesters to relinquish the buildings they hold and promised amnesty for those who do. But the immediate answer from behind the barricades was defiant. As one of the leaders of the occupation in Donetsk put it to CNN "We have not come this far just to leave without our demands being met. It is the Kiev government that is illegitimate. They have to give up the buildings they have seized." There was a similar response from protest leaders in the southern city of Mariupol. So how might events in Ukraine unfold between now and the May 25 elections? Here are some of the scenarios that could play out but events are moving swiftly and unpredictably. Peace breaks o ut The Geneva agreement offered what U.S. President Barack Obama called "a glimmer of hope." But John Kerry his top diplomat cautioned after the talks: "None of us leave here with the sense that the job is done because the words are on the paper." The job of implementing the agreement has fallen to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) which already has about 100 monitors in eastern Ukraine and is tasked with negotiating the surrender of occupied buildings. In Kerry's words "what is vital is that the OSCE needs to get to work immediately to de-escalate the security situation in Luhansk in Donetsk in Slavyansk and all the other towns that have been destabilized." But the OSCE monitors have no powers of enforcement - and the visceral hatred of the pro-Russian groups for both the U.S. and Europe makes their task a daunting one. CNN met a team of observers in Slavyansk on Monday after they'd spent two hours with the self-declared mayor. They confined themselves to a brief statement that gave no indication of progress and the Organization later acknowledged problems in gaining access to the town. Put simply the occupiers don't see themselves as behaving illegally. Denis Pushilin who's become the political voice of the so-called "Donetsk People's Republic" turned the tables on Kiev saying the government (or junta as pro-Russian groups prefer to call it) had come to power through a coup and was itself illegally occupying public buildings. Pushilin insisted that plans for a local referendum on Donetsk's future -- organized by the protesters -- would proceed. We heard the same message in Slavyansk Luhansk and Mariupol. Much hinges on what sort of constitutional reform emerges. Kerry said Thursday that the Ukrainian government had gone "to extraordinary lengths to address regional demands for more autonomy for local self-government for the protection of minority rights." Visiting Donetsk recently Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk promised far-reaching devolution to the regions including greater control over their finances. But Russia wants more - a guarantee that Ukraine won't join NATO and direct elections in the regions to both legislative and executive office. One of the most centralized states on earth is demanding sweeping decentralization next door. As William Partlett a lecturer at Columbia University's School of Law writes in the magazine Jurist : "The 'framers' of the new Ukrainian constitution therefore are likely not to just be Ukrainians-and the bargaining is just as likely to take place in Geneva rather than Kiev." The government's attitude toward a referendum has been ambivalent. Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov has said he is "not against" a national referendum on the country's form of government perhaps in tandem with the presidential vote. But the protesters say they will accept nothing less than a regional referendum that gives Donetsk and other eastern regions the option to secede from Ukraine. They have set up committees in Luhansk and Donetsk to plan a vote on May 11 though how it would be organized in an area with a population of more than 6.5 million people is open to question. Few of the protesters have any government experience: 32-year old Pushilin is a former security guard turned businessman and Irina Voropayeva the spokeswoman in Mariupol a housewife. And whether it would be seen as free and fair without an independent election body or international observers is questionable. The irony is that several polls conducted by Ukrainian NGOs in recent months suggest the supporters of unification with Russia are in a minority. The Institute for Social Studies and Political Analysis in Donetsk reported in March that two-thirds of respondents were not in favor of joining Russia. But a majority also thought Ukraine was going in the wrong direction. Ukraine's government recovers control of the east On the evidence of the past few weeks that seems very improbable. Pro-Russian groups control buildings from Slavyansk in the north to Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. They are often led by "men in green" as the uniformed groups have become known. They are now the effective authority in swathes of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Local police have either vanished or cut a deal with them. The army's first attempts to assert a presence in the east have been disastrous. South of Kramatorsk last Wednesday CNN encountered a column of a dozen armored personnel carriers stranded either side of a railway line. Some 100 soldiers of the 25th Airborne Brigade exhausted and dejected were being harangued by local people as the leader of a pro-Russian group negotiated terms for their release. Eventually they gave up much of their equipment and were allowed to leave and the next day Turchynov disbanded the unit. Six armored personnel carriers (APCs) from another unit were seized and paraded in Slavyansk. CNN followed one military convoy of some 70 vehicles for two hours across a rural swathe of Donetsk region. Several of its vehicles broke down; most were of Soviet vintage and in poor repair. Stragglers were left behind. Morale seemed brittle at best. Ukrainian police have been largely invisible as the crisis has unfolded. Riot police virtually surrounded a pro-Kiev rally in Donetsk to prevent clashes last week but elsewhere local police have stepped aside whenever trouble has surfaced. At one roadblock between Donetsk and Slavyansk they have stood across the road as pro-Russian protesters check traffic. Civil war Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Ukraine is on the brink of civil war but it doesn't look like that. The pro-Russian protesters are often in dozens rather than hundreds and there is very little pro-Kiev sentiment on display. The pro-Kiev rally in Donetsk last week attracted about 1000 people. There have been no large rallies or street clashes. Traffic streams down Artyoma Street in Donetsk oblivious or used to the barricades of tires and Russian flags outside the regional government building and children play on swings within sight of the coils of razor-wire. It seems many people here don't want to get involved. Some fear that they will be attacked if they show their colors. But the great majority are going about their daily business as normal too preoccupied with making ends meet as the economy worsens and the value of the hryvna (Ukraine's currency) slides. It's down nearly 30% against the dollar this year. The last thing they want is violence. Katerina a young mother out with her son in a Donetsk park last Friday expressed the exasperation felt by many here. "If my son asks me about what happened we ourselves don't understand. Who is in power? Those people who are right? Or those who are not?" she said. In the countryside life goes on slowly. Cows are led to pasture elderly women sit on benches and gossip. The barricades seem a long way distant. There is a risk that ultra-nationalists in Kiev - known as the Pravy Sektor or Right Sektor - will organize groups to confront the enemy in the east. Pro-Russian leaders in Slavyansk accused the group of being behind a shooting at a rural roadblock on Sunday and paraded ID tags allegedly identifying the assailants as members of the Sektor. Moscow chimed in accusing Kiev of being "unwilling to put in check and disarm nationalists and extremists." Right Sektor swiftly denied it had any members in the area and the incident seemed to raise more questions than it answered. But a rash of such incidents however caused could bring Russian intervention closer. A Russian invasion Both Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have said repeatedly that Russia has no plans to invade or annex eastern Ukraine despite the presence of some 40000 Russian troops close to the border. Such an incursion would lead to far more stringent sanctions against Russia by the West; and the use of conventional forces in an occupation would be a dangerous and expensive move at a time when the Russian economy is stuttering. In any case Russia's interests are already being served by the "men in green" some of whom have come to eastern Ukraine from Russia Crimea and Belarus and who are chipping away at Kiev's authority in the region. But should the Ukrainian government try to reassert its authority in the east or Ukrainian nationalists arrive in numbers leading to casualties among the protesters Moscow's calculations might change. It has consistently promised to protect Russian "compatriots" in Ukraine and during his lengthy news conference last week said: "I remind you that the Federation Council (the upper house of the Russian Duma) has given the president the right to use armed forces in Ukraine." He also used the term "Novorossiya" to talk about parts of Ukraine -- a word used during the 1700s to describe the Tsarist expansion of Russia's borders southward to the Black Sea. To those in the former Soviet republics who believe Putin's ambition is to restore a Greater Russia it was a telling moment. Pro-Russian protesters in Ukraine call for Russian help on an almost daily basis begging for protection from the "fascists." The self-declared mayor of Slavyansk Vyacheslav Ponomarev appealed to Putin directly Sunday saying: "If you can't send peace-keeping troops please help with food weapons whatever you can. Our people are ready to fight to defend our land from the fascist invasion." If these sporadic cries for help gather pace with or without Moscow's encouragement a full-scale Russian intervention cannot be discounted. The messy status quo To many observers that seems the most likely scenario - a stand-off between Kiev and pro-Russian groups in the east. The young and largely inexperienced Ukrainian government has shown itself incapable of dealing with the pro-Russian groups who in turn don't have (as yet) the muscle to turn protest into outright secession. Ukrainian security forces even appear to be trying to lock in the contagion with military and police checkpoints springing up on the borders between Kharkiv and Donetsk regions and checkpoints around Donetsk city beefed up. There is growing coordination between the protesters in different cities and the small groups of unknown uniformed men have shown it doesn't take much to seize buildings that are largely unguarded. A CNN team observed several vehicles with masked men leaving Slavyansk on Monday; two hours later they were involved in the seizure of the police station in nearby Kramatorsk. But the pro-Russian protesters don't appear capable of governing. Many of those milling about the regional government building in Donetsk wearing balaclava masks are teenagers. No political leader has yet emerged as a figure with whom the government (or the OSCE) could negotiate. The next steps will be the publication of a new draft constitution and the May 11 vote organized by pro-Russian groups in the east. Turchynov the acting President insisted Tuesday that the "majority of Ukrainian citizens are for a united unitary democratic Ukraine with greater powers given to the regions."

See the crisis in Ukraine before Crimea voted Russia and the West locked in match of wits over eastern Ukraine Russia moved thousands of troops to border and is accused of stirring unrest in east Ukraine Speck: West must unite to pass severe sanctions on Russian regime Speck: Ukrainian government attempt to retake buildings could spark Russian invasion Editor's note: Ulrich Speck is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Europe think tank in Brussels . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his. Follow @uli_speck and @Carnegie_Europe on Twitter. (CNN) -- Russia's seizure of Crimea last month may have unfolded with a lightning quickness but Vladimir Putin and the West are now engaged in a much slower match of wits on a chessboard stretching across most of eastern Ukraine . Rather than going for checkmate both sides now seem content to wait for the other to make a mistake. Putin made a strong first move by placing 40000 troops on the border -- and separatists who are not officially linked to Russia on the ground in Ukraine. Now Moscow is waiting for the pro-Western government in Kiev to try to retake the parts of the east it has seemingly lost. In Russia's eyes any such move from the capital would legitimize an overwhelming counterattack -- a re-run of the Georgia crisis in 2008 when President Mikheil Saakashvili lost his nerve shot first and prompted a Russian invasion. Putin's problem is time; he cannot wait forever to strike. Troops cannot remain ready for combat for many months at a time. Separatists in eastern Ukraine are lost without outside support and may become nervous as time drags on without any glimpse of a light at the end of the tunnel. On the other side of the board are U.S. President Barack Obama German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukraine's fledgling government. The biggest challenge for Obama and his German counterpart is to keep a united Western front. They need to uphold a credible threat of massive economic sanctions that could undercut the Kremlin's funding if it doesn't toe the line. But cracks in Western unity are visible everywhere. Europe may be concerned about Russian aggression in Ukraine but the continent is dragging its collective feet on taking a more confrontational stance towards Putin. Some nations fear Russian pressure especially on their energy supply. Many are nervous about the price their own countries will pay as a result of tougher sanctions. And nobody is sure yet whether they're ready to abandon the idea of Russia as a vital partner. Obama on the other hand is much more inclined to put the squeeze on the Kremlin. Washington is used to confrontation with Russia -- and with Putin specifically -- and America is much less  with its old Cold War rival. American leaders aren't motivated solely by their concern over eastern Europe and Russia reasserting itself as a more aggressive and expansionist power. The U.S. also wants to assert key norms of international order -- namely territorial integrity and the principle to change borders only with the consent of all parties. Ukraine is also a welcome opportunity to signal to allies and rivals alike that America is not retrenching from its global engagements. The impact of the Ukraine crisis on China and the various territorial conflicts with its neighbors will also loom very large on the minds of policy makers in Washington. But whatever the differences among U.S. and EU leaders the more they act in concert the better chance they have to achieve their goal: beating back Moscow's attempt to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The West also needs to make sure that Kiev's interim government doesn't lose its nerve. As hard as it is for leaders to watch pro-Russian separatists take over their buildings any large-scale operation in eastern Ukraine could give Putin the opportunity he may be waiting for: invasion with some kind of dubious pseudo-legal cover. It is difficult to say who is in a better position. Putin is a master tactician. Since his years as a KGB agent in Dresden in the 1980s he has gained much expertise in finding and exploiting the West's weak spots. And he seems to have broad support at home for his confrontational brand of politics. Putin's weakness is his regime's economic dependency on the West. Without the steady flow of income from the sale of gas and oil brought under control of the Kremlin the regime would not be able to buy support at home and to finance costly and risky foreign policy adventures. The West has no appetite to confront Russia. But if Putin's tanks roll into eastern Ukraine out of the blue without any pretense of legitimacy he will turn Western opinion even further against him. This could give Merkel and Obama the necessary backing for tough sanctions. If he is to achieve his main goal which is to prevent Ukraine from associating closer with the West Putin will have to move fast. He probably needs to have some kind of Russian presence inside Ukraine (apart from Crimea) as control over separatists in the east alone might not be sufficient or sustainable. A full-scale crackdown by the Ukrainian government on separatists would give Moscow the cover to move some Russian troops as "peacekeepers" into eastern Ukraine. Once inside the country another "frozen conflict" could be created which would destabilize the country and prevent Western attempts to help Ukraine to get on its feet. This would keep Putin's longer-term ambition -- to bring Ukraine into a Moscow-led alliance or federation -- very much alive. If the Kremlin comes to the conclusion that the West wouldn't respond to such a move with painful sanctions -- ones that would damage Putin's inner circle and be strong enough to sap major sources of income for the Kremlin -- Putin might choose to move along such lines or in other ways. But if the U.S. and EU demonstrate that they are truly ready to use economic warfare to counter the Russian military machine the West may yet be able to deter Putin from going much further. Something has to give soon.

"Russia_s_trade_ties_preventing_harsher_sanctions",""_Sun_27_Apr_2014_06_29_31_EDT",""","West threatens Russia with more sanctions but trade relations complex By Irene Chapple and Ivana Kottasova CNN April 25 2014 -- Updated 1238 GMT (2038 HKT) This map shows the general routes of the main gas pipelines that go through Ukraine and the EU's dependence on Russia for energy. Design: Inez Torre/CNN Russia risks being isolated by the West as it introduces visa bans and threatens more sanctions But the European Union is reliant on Russia for its energy supplies and has strong trade links Trade is not so important between Russia and U.S. which is becoming energy self-sufficient These differences have impacted the economic approaches to Russia amid the crisis in Ukraine (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama has warned Russia that targeted sanctions are "ready to go" as the Geneva agreement to de-escalate the crisis falters. Officials have vowed more punitive international actions targeting Russia's economy if Moscow in their view continues to aggravate the situation. Key Putin allies high-profile Russian oligarchs and possibly Russian institutions and companies will be targeted CNN has been told. Obama at a news conference Friday in South Korea said he would be talking to other European leaders about sanctions against Russia as the Ukraine crisis worsens. The West has already introduced sanctions imposing financial and visa restrictions on around 30 Russian and Ukrainian officials -- but stopping short of measures that would hit trade. However the uncertainty has fed capital flight prompting Standard & Poor's to cut Russia's credit rating to one notch above junk. Hours later Russia raised its interest rates to limit the damage. Ukraine hiked its bank rates on April in an attempts to protect its economy against the turmoil triggered by violent protests and Russia's military intervention in Crimea. Russia is deeply integrated in the global economy and links with the EU are particularly strong. Here's the background to Russia's relationship with the West. How important is Russia's economy? Russia is the eight biggest economy in the world with GDP of more than $2 trillion. Its economy -- which is heavily reliant on commodities particularly oil and gas -- is expected to grow only slightly in 2014 to around $2.4 trillion. Hopes it would be one of the decade's powerhouse economies have faded with its GDP growing just 1.3% last year compared to 2012 one of the sharpest slowdowns in the emerging markets. Russia boomed in the late 1990s and early 2000s as energy prices rose then stumbled as demand for commodities contracted. But its energy supplies remain vitally important for the European Union to which it supplies a third of its natural gas. Germany the eurozone's biggest economy imports around 40% of its gas from Russia. With the Ukraine crisis taking its toll Russia's economy may not grow at all in 2014 some analysts have warned. What is Russia's economic relationship with the U.S? The economic relationship between Russia and the U.S. is unbalanced. Russia is the 20th largest trading partner for the U.S. with $27 billion worth of trade exported across the Atlantic. On the flip-side the U.S. is Russia's fifth largest partner with just $11 billion worth of trade. According to Russian Foundation chair David Clark trade is a "relatively unimportant" component of relations. Energy links are also weakening as the U.S. looks to shale gas for its energy supplies and heads towards self-sufficiency. However in March the U.S. State Department took its first step on sanctions imposing a visa ban on Russian and Ukrainian officials and individuals "responsible for or complicit in threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine." An expansion of the sanctions has been threatened. What is Russia's economic relationship with the EU? The EU is Russia's largest trading partner and there are deep economic links between the two. Almost half of Russia's exports -- $292 billion worth -- end up in EU countries. Russia in turn is the third biggest trading partner for the EU with $169 billion in imports. The EU initially stepped more cautiously than the U.S. on sanctions. However earlier this month the EU said it would reinforce sanctions and target an additional four people in its sanctions. This will bring the total number of people subject to EU asset freezes to 22. Members of the G8 have also said they will not attend a planned summit in Sochi this June instead meeting in Brussels without Russia. Meanwhile the West has offered $16 billion in aid for Ukraine helping the country prop up its ailing finances. The International Monetary Fund has also said Ukraine has $14 billion to $18 billion credit available if required. Why did the U.S. and EU approach Russia differently ? The eurozone has only just emerged from its own crisis and commentators say it could be wary of rapidly cutting ties with such a powerful economic partner. Its reliance on gas out of Russia would also feed caution. In contrast the U.S. is weaning itself off Russia's energy supplies and its trade relationship is much less intertwined.

See the crisis in Ukraine before Crimea voted NEW: An ailing Swedish member of the OSCE team has been freed Self-declared mayor of Slavyansk stages media event with captured inspectors OSCE team leader says the inspectors are being held against their will Obama says Russia hasn't "lifted a finger" to defuse the crisis Slavyansk Ukraine (CNN) -- Pro-Russian separatists holding a European military observer team in eastern Ukraine released one of the observers for medical reasons Sunday shortly after parading them before cameras officials on both sides of the dispute said. At least seven of the inspectors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe appeared at a news conference staged by the self-declared mayor of Slavyansk Vyacheslav Ponomarev who referred to them as "prisoners of war." The freed observer was from Sweden and had been suffering from diabetes Ponomarev spokeswoman Stella Khorosheva told CNN. And Michael Bociurkiw an OSCE spokesman in Kiev the Ukrainian capital called it "a welcome development." Holger Schmuck one of the German members of the team said earlier that their captors had ensured the ailing observer had all the water and sugar he needed and were taking particular care of him. The monitors were seized Friday outside Slavyansk one of the flashpoints in the standoff between Ukraine's interim government and pro-Russian factions challenging its authority in the east. They said that although they have diplomatic status they went along with Sunday's news conference because the mayor asked them to. "We are held here; I cannot go home on my free decision ... and it is logical in the eyes of the mayor Ponomarev that he can use us to present his positions" delegation leader Axel Schneider said. Schneider said the team which includes eight Europeans and several Ukrainians was being held in the cellar of a building. He said the observers agreed to the news conference so that their families could see them and that the conditions in which they are being held had significantly improved in the past 24 hours. The observers are always guarded by armed men but they had not been threatened he said. Nevertheless an air of unease hung over the men whose immediate fate remains uncertain. Talks are under way between the separatists and a second OSCE team in Slavyansk that was sent to seek their release Khorosheva said. Spy accusation Ponomarev has accused the monitors of being spies for NATO and said he might exchange them for pro-Russian activists held by Kiev but it is not clear if that would be a basis for any negotiations. No evidence has been produced to support any claim they strayed outside their mission. One OSCE mission in Ukraine is tasked with helping to implement an international agreement signed April 17 in Switzerland which called for illegal militia groups to disarm and leave occupied buildings among other provisions. However the abducted inspectors were working in the restive eastern Donetsk province under the mandate of a previously agreed OSCE mission. The interim government in Kiev has said the OSCE inspectors are being held by terrorists. Besides the Germans and the freed Swede the other monitors are from Denmark Poland Bulgaria and the Czech Republic Russian state media said. Obama: Unite against Russia's actions Many eastern Ukraine residents have Russian roots and sympathize with Moscow. But Western nations and Kiev have accused Russia of stirring up unrest in its neighbor and supporting the armed separatists' revolt. Earlier Sunday U.S. President Barack Obama urged the world to unite in its disapproval of Russian actions in Ukraine. "Russia has not lifted a finger to help -- in fact there's strong evidence that they've been encouraging the kinds of activities that have taken place" Obama said speaking from Malaysia where he is on a diplomatic visit. Rather than going with sanctions alone and making it a United States versus Russia issue "it's important for us to make sure that we're part of an international coalition in sending that message and Russia is isolated rather than (the perception that) the U.S. is trying to pull Ukraine out of his orbit" he said. G7 leaders have said they will impose additional sanctions on Russia over its role in the crisis. Specific EU and U.S. measures are expected to be announced in the coming days. Russia's Foreign Ministry insisted Saturday it was taking all possible measures to resolve the situation over the abducted OSCE team. In a statement it added that the security of the observers is the responsibility of the hosting country. Friction point The perilous face-off intensified Saturday when Russian state news complained that Ukraine had mobilized 15000 troops in the suburbs of Slavyansk "in order to wipe out the city and its residents." Quoting a Russian Defense Ministry source RIA Novosti said satellite photos showed the force forming around the city that has become a friction point between the Ukraine military and pro-Russian militants. The Defense Ministry source said the number of Ukrainian troops put the pro-Russian militants at a disadvantage because the latter are "armed only with small amount of pistols and shotguns." The source said the photos showed about 160 tanks 230 infantry combat vehicles and armored personnel carriers mine throwers and multiple-launch rocket systems. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly criticized what he says is Kiev's use of force against Ukrainian civilians. Developments in Ukraine have come at a rapid pace in recent days: -- On Sunday separatist leader Denis Pushilin told CNN that a regional TV station in Donetsk had been seized. "The people have gone there. They want to watch Russian channels and are tired of the Ukrainian TV lies" he said. -- Militants in the town of Gorlivka have captured Ukrainian Security Service officers who were seeking to arrest a Russian citizen suspected of murdering a pro-Kiev lawmaker the security service said Sunday. -- Russian military aircraft "crossed and violated" Ukrainian airspace seven times Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told reporters in Rome on Saturday. The Russian Defense Ministry denied the accusation according to the state news agency ITAR-Tass. -- Yatsenyuk met with Pope Francis while in Rome on Saturday. The meeting has been seen as a sign of support from the Vatican for his government. -- Russia which already had 40000 troops on its side of the border started new military drills Thursday after Ukrainian forces said they killed five pro-Russian militants. A day later Ukraine launched the second stage of an "anti-terrorist operation" against militants in Slavyansk. Speaking Saturday Yatsenyuk urged Russia to pull back its security forces and not to support pro-Russian militants in eastern and southern Ukraine. "We urge Russia to leave us alone" he said in televised remarks. Ukraine's government has promised constitutional reforms and protections for Russian speakers in a bid to ease the tensions in its eastern regions.

In an interview with state-run RT Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov lamented how he felt U.S. officials were quick to blame his nation for everything awry in Ukraine and to insist Moscow can unilaterally solve it all. Lavrov said that while those in Ukraine's east and south who defiantly oppose the Kiev-based government are "not puppets" of the Kremlin such a characterization would describe the relationship between Ukraine's leadership in Kiev and the United States. "(Americans) have I think overwhelming influence" he said. "They act in a much more open way without any scruples compared to the Europeans ... You cannot avoid the impression that they are running the show very much very much." As proof Lavrov pointed to the timing of the Ukrainian government's relaunch of its security operation just after a two-day visit from U.S. Vice President Joe Biden. He claimed acting President Oleksandr Turchynov has "ordered the army to shoot at ... people if they are engaged in peaceful protests" yet hasn't disarmed extremists and what he called "the right sector." Some in Ukraine's east are occupying official buildings defying the Kiev government and openly siding with Russia"after several months of total neglect of their interests" Lavrov said. The minister faulted the new Kiev government for not doing more including taking the necessary "first step" to implement an international deal brokered in Geneva Switzerland. About a week after being reached that deal has done little to defuse the crisis. On the contrary both sides appear to be digging in. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaliy Yarema said Wednesday that "the active phase of the anti-terrorist operation continues" in the eastern cities of Kramatorsk Slavyansk Donetsk and Luhansk according to state-run news agency Ukrinform. Militants in those cities have shown no inclination to leave the government buildings they have seized or disarm as was mandated by the Geneva agreement. Meanwhile NATO estimates that Russia has massed 40000 troops near its border with Ukraine which has fueled speculation the conflict could only get bigger and more violent with Russia possibly taking over some if not all of Ukraine and possibly neighboring nations. Lavrov didn't say any military intervention was imminent but he didn't rule it out either. "If our interests our legitimate interests the interests of Russians have been attacked directly -- like they were in South Ossetia for example -- I do not see any other way but to respond in accordance with international law" he told RT referring to Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia. "Russian citizens being attacked is an attack against the Russian Federation." Pro-Russian activists storm an administration building in the center of Luhansk Ukraine on Tuesday April 29.

See the crisis in Ukraine before Crimea voted U.S. vows to defend fellow NATO members The United States isn't standing still militarily sending personnel to allied nations near Ukraine that have grown increasingly wary of Russia's military intentions. On Wednesday a company-size contingent of U.S. Army paratroopers arrived in Swidwin Poland for training exercises at Warsaw's request. They'll be there through at least the end of the year according to Stephen Mull the U.S. ambassador to Poland. The contingent is part of "a persistent rotational presence" that Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby has said will involve four Italy-based companies of paratroopers that will go to Poland Lithuania Latvia and Estonia over the next few months. "Poland has been there for the United States" Mull said Wednesday in front U.S. troops standing in formation next to Polish troops. "Today as the trans-Atlantic community confronts Russia's unacceptable aggression against Poland's neighbor Ukraine a sovereign and independent state we have a solemn obligation in the framework of NATO to reassure Poland of our security guarantee." The United States and its allies have accused Russia of fomenting unrest in Ukraine since massive demonstrations helped push out President Viktor Yanukovych who came under fire for moving Ukraine away from the European Union and closer to Russia. The allegations include Moscow's sending members of its armed forces into the country providing other support for pro-Russian militants or generally contributing to an atmosphere of distrust and instability. Whatever the cause or culprit a part of Ukraine -- Crimea -- has broken off and joined Russia. Some in the West fear that Russia will try to repeat that scenario elsewhere in Ukraine and perhaps in other countries in which ethnic Russians live or where Russia or the former Soviet Union historically has had significant influence. Some of those countries include the Baltic states and Poland which like the United States are part of NATO. The treaty that defines this alliances states that if any one NATO member "is the victim of an armed attack each and every other member of the alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked." As a result the United States and its NATO allies are publicly stepping up involvement in places like Poland to dissuade Russian President Vladimir Putin from thinking that advancing into these countries is an option according to Kurt Volker a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. "I think that if we did not take the steps that we are taking now (Putin) would think that maybe it's an option" Volker who served as ambassador from 2008 and 2009 told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "... If we did not do that I think he would wonder: What would be the response of NATO if he did have some ... action there?" Counterclaims over politician's death Within Ukraine itself -- particularly the east and south -- government forces and pro-Russian militants continued their unsettling standoff. The situation seemed largely peaceful with hints of violence here and there. A Ukrainian army helicopter for instance was targeted Wednesday "by unknown gunmen" in Kramatorsk which is about 9 miles (15 kilometers) from Slavyansk. On Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry website Deputy Minister Sergiy Yaroviy said the helicopter suffered "minor damage" to its blades but was able to land safely with no injuries to its crew. The same couldn't be said about the discovery Saturday of two tortured bodies near Slavyansk. One of them was pro-Kiev politician Vladimir Rybak who Ukraine's Interior Ministry said Wednesday died as a result of injuries from torture and drowning. Stanislav Rechinsky an adviser to the interior minister blamed pro-Russian militants for having tortured and "kidnapped" him and others. "We have eyewitnesses who testified about hearing the so-called little green men bragging about the murders" he said Wednesday. "We have another eyewitness who saw these men alive in the torture cells and who was able to escape." The term "little green men" has become widely used for the unidentified armed men who have appeared in eastern Ukraine in recent days. Russia has denied they are Russian military forces in uniforms that don't bear insignia. Yet a pro-Russian leader in Slavyansk de facto Mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryo vehemently denies such allegations instead blaming the deaths on far-right Ukrainian nationalist extremists.

"Dutch_jets_intercept_Russian_bombers",""Wed_23_Apr_2014_18_33_21_EDT",""","Dutch fighter jets intercept 2 Russian bombers in their airspace By Lindsay Isaac and Greg Botelho CNN April 23 2014 -- Updated 2233 GMT (0633 HKT) Dutch spokesman: 2 Russian bombers enter Dutch airspace by a half mile 2 F-16 Dutch fighter jets intercept the Russian planes escort them away British military jets later become involved; action is called "not unusual" But it comes amid heightened tensions between Russia and NATO (CNN) -- Dutch fighter jets scrambled Wednesday to intercept a pair of Russian military aircraft that entered their airspace a fairly routine action that comes amid heightened tensions between Russia and NATO a Dutch official said. Maj. Wilko Ter Horst said that the military learned around 3:50 p.m. (9:50 a.m. ET) that two Russian TU-95 bombers known as Bears had come a half-mile inside its airspace. A pair of Dutch F-16 military jets were then dispatched to escort the Russian planes and "ensure they (flew) out of our airspace" said Ter Horst a Dutch military spokesman. Such a sequence of events isn't uncommon with the Netherlands military spokesman explaining "this is a national procedure when aircraft infringe (on) national Dutch airspace." He estimated Dutch fighter jets scramble to check out unknown aircraft -- be they from Russia or another country -- about four or five times a year. "It is not unusual" Ter Horst added. "Sometimes they cross Dutch airspace and sometimes they stay north of Dutch airspace (in the country's so-called area of responsibility)." In this case British military aircraft took over from the Dutch in escorting the Russian planes. A British Defense Ministry spokesman said that planes from his military left from Royal Air Force station Leuchars "to determine the identity of unknown aircraft that approached the NATO Air Policing Area north of Scotland and could not be identified by other means." These planes were later identified as the Russian military planes. The spokesman stressed that they didn't enter British airspace nor has any Russian military plane ever done so. "The Russian military aircraft remained in international airspace at all times as they are perfectly entitled to do" the spokesman said. In a separate and "standard" event Britain's HMS Dragon met up with the Russian ship Vice Admiral Kulakov as it was "transiting past the UK" according to the military spokesman. The British naval destroyer is now "keeping an eye on its transit south" he added. There was no immediate mention of this story on the English-language versions of at least two Russian state-run media outlets RT and RIA Novosti. While British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said his military is always on alert "to intercept any non-NATO forces" he did not portray these specific incidents as alarming. "Recent events have increased awareness of Russian military activity" Hammond said. "But we have always routinely intercepted identified and escorted Russian air and naval assets that transit international airspace and waters within the UK's 'area of interest.'" Both the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are part of NATO which has been increasingly at odds with Russia over its activity in and around Ukraine . The tensions ratcheted up late last year when demonstrators pushed out Ukraine's president in part due to their anger about his moving away from an alliance with Europe and moving closer to Russia. A pro-Western government took over in Kiev. Soon after the Crimean peninsula seceded from Ukraine and became part of Russia. Since then Russia has deployed what NATO estimates to be 40000 troops near its border with Ukraine which has made other countries in the area nervous. In an interview Wednesday with RT Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia would "certainly respond" if its interests were attacked in Ukraine. "Russian citizens being attacked is an attack against the Russian Federation" Lavrov said.

"Racist_words_attributed_to_NBA_owner",""Sun_27_Apr_2014_14_59_19_EDT",""","NBA players protest racist talk attributed to L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling By Ralph Ellis and Steve Almasy CNN April 28 2014 -- Updated 1227 GMT (2027 HKT) NEW: Clippers players in apparent protest wear shirts inside out to hide logos NEW: Sterling's girlfriend's lawyer says she didn't release the recordings NEW: Michael Jordan denounces "such sickening and offensive views" The website Deadspin released new recording Sunday (CNN) -- The players in the National Basketball Association spoke out Sunday about racist comments attributed to Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. The Clippers players staged a silent protest. As they warmed up for an NBA playoff game the players removed their warmup shirts bearing team logos to reveal red T-shirts worn inside out with the logos hidden. They finished warming up removed the red shirts and played the game wearing their regular uniforms. The National Basketball Players Association demanded Sterling be barred from all playoff games this season. The players also want an accounting of past accusations of racism against Sterling; an explanation of what kind of discipline might be issued; assurance that the league commissioner will work with the association; and assurance the investigation will be conducted swiftly. And throughout the day past stars including Michael Jordan slammed Sterling. Sterling wasn't there to see the protest or his team lose 118-97 to the Golden State Warriors. He agreed to stay away from the game because of the controversy that heightened Sunday when the website Deadspin released an additional audio recording of a conversation that purports to be Sterling talking with girlfriend V. Stiviano earlier this month. Neither Deadspin nor TMZ which released a similar recording Saturday said where they got the recordings. Stiviano's lawyer's office said Sunday that she didn't release the recordings but that they're legitimate. "This office understands that the currently released audio tape of approximately 15 minutes is a portion of approximately one (1) hour of overall audio recording of Mr. Donald T. Sterling and Ms. Stiviano and is in fact legitimate" Mac E. Nehoray said in a news release. "Ms. Stiviano did not release the tape(s) to any news media." The 15-minute Deadspin recording purports to be Sterling talking with Stiviano about her Instagram photo feed. The photos include images of her with African-Americans including NBA great Earvin "Magic" Johnson. If authentic the remarks seem to reflect Sterling's embarrassment and frustration with Stiviano over her associating with African-Americans at Clippers games and for posting such pictures on her Instagram account. Three NBA legends lashed out at Sterling Sunday. Jordan considered the league's greatest player and now the majority owner of the Charlotte Bobcats said: "As an owner I'm obviously disgusted that a fellow team owner could hold such sickening and offensive views. ... As a former player I'm completely outraged. There is no room in the NBA -- or anywhere else -- for the kind of racism and hatred that Mr. Sterling allegedly expressed." NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar who was a Clippers special assistant coach in 2000 told CNN: "I know him. I know his voice. I am not surprised by this very much." But Abdul-Jabbar said Sterling was congenial in person and said he never heard any racist words from Sterling. Still the recording shows a "repugnant attitude for someone to have and for him to be an employer for so many people of color it kind of blows your mind." Johnson speaking on an ABC pregame show Sunday said Sterling needs to go. "He shouldn't own a team any more. And he should stand up and say 'I don't want to own a team any more' " Johnson said. 'Is that racism? ' In the latest recording a man and woman talk about the photos and he tells her he cannot change cultural beliefs Deadspin reported . The woman says she doesn't think the man is racist but the people around him have "poison minds." "It's the world! You go to Israel the blacks are just treated like dogs" the man says. He says there are white Jews and black Jews and they are treated 100% differently. "And is that right?" the woman asks. "It isn't a question -- we don't evaluate what's right and wrong we live in a society. We live in a culture. We have to live within that culture" the man replies. When the woman says she doesn't share the man's views about race he tells her: "Well then if you don't feel -- don't come to my games. Don't bring black people and don't come." The woman who says she is of mixed race reminds him that most of his team's players are African-American. "I support them and give them food and clothes and cars and houses. Who gives it to them? Does someone else give it to them? Do I know that I have -- Who makes the game? Do I make the game or do they make the game?" The woman compares racial discrimination to the Holocaust. "And you're Jewish. You understand discrimination" she says. The man disagrees with the analogy and says that what he's talking about is not discrimination. "There's no racism here. If you don't want to be walking into a basketball game with a certain person is that racism?" the man says. Investigation under way NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Saturday that Sterling who has owned the basketball franchise for nearly three decades is now under investigation over the comments attributed to him. Silver said that the league's investigation will seek to determine whether the recording is authentic and to figure out the context in which these "offensive and disturbing" comments were made. But he cautioned that Sterling must be afforded due process so he would not speculate on any possible punishment but said that the investigation will move "extraordinarily quickly." Clippers President Andy Roeser on Saturday suggested a woman -- whom he doesn't mention by name -- was "getting even" with Sterling over a lawsuit. Rochelle Sterling the wife of Donald Sterling filed a lawsuit last month against Stiviano who she said was having an affair with her husband. In the complaint Rochelle Sterling accuses Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. The suit claims that Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari two Bentleys and a Range Rover and that Stiviano took possession of a $1.8 million duplex through fraud. Sterling also gave her nearly $250000 in cash the court document says. Stiviano countered in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and she never took advantage of the Clippers owner who made much of his fortune in real estate. Reaction: 'Disturbing and offensive' 'And don't bring him to my games' Speaking about the recording Roeser said "We do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered. We do know that the woman on the tape -- who we believe released it to TMZ -- is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million who told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even.'" According to the website TMZ Sterling reportedly made discriminatory remarks during an argument he had with Stiviano on April 9. TMZ on Saturday posted a 10-minute recording purporting to be the argument. The man alleged to be Sterling takes particular exception to a photo she posted to Instagram with Johnson. "In your lousy f**ing Instagrams you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people" the man says. "If it's white people it's OK?" she responds. "If it was Larry Bird would it make a difference?" Bird the longtime Boston Celtics star was Johnson's NBA rival. "I've known (Magic) well and he should be admired. ... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately" the man on the recording says. "Admire him bring him here feed him f**k him but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games." Roeser said Sterling is upset and apologizes for sentiments attributed to him about Johnson. "(Sterling) has long considered Magic a friend and has only the utmost respect and admiration for him -- both in terms of who he is and what he has achieved." Sterling is "emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with nor does it reflect his views beliefs or feelings" Roeser said. President Obama's response President Barack Obama weighed in on the controversy. At a news conference with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Sunday Obama was asked about the comments on the recording. "When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance you don't really have to do anything you just let them talk. That's what happened here" the President said. Obama also said Sterling's alleged comments are an example of how "the United States continues to wrestle with the legacy of race and slavery and segregation." The president of the California NAACP suggested fans boycott Clippers games. "We also suggest that African-Americans and Latinos should honor (Sterling's) request and not attend the games" Alice Huffman said in a statement released Saturday. Sterling was to receive a lifetime achievement award at an event next month to mark the 100th anniversary of the Los Angeles NAACP but the national organization tweeted Sunday that wouldn't happen. LeBron James speaks out The release of the recordings comes at a bad time for the Clippers who are playing in the first round of the NBA playoffs. "I don't know if I'm surprised or not" Clippers head coach Doc Rivers said at the team's practice Saturday adding that he "obviously" didn't like the comments. Rivers who is in his first year coaching the team told reporters that he didn't want the controversy to detract from the playoffs. He said he would be the sole person speaking on behalf of the team. But Chris Paul a Clippers player and president of the National Basketball Players Association issued a statement Saturday saying "this is a very serious issue which we will address aggressively." Helping the players association will be Kevin Johnson a former NBA player and current Sacramento California mayor. "There needs to be an immediate investigation and if the reports are true there needs to be strong and swift action taken" Johnson said in a statement on the NBPA website. Miami Heat forward LeBron James was one of several players and former players who weighed in on the controversy. James spoke to reporters before the playoff game against the Charlotte Bobcats Saturday night. "If the reports are true it's unacceptable. It's unacceptable in our league. It doesn't matter if you're white black Hispanic whatever all across the races. It's unacceptable and as a commissioner in our league they have to make a stand and they have to be very aggressive with it." "Should this guy continue to be an owner?" asked Shaquille O'Neal who also called the comments "repugnant." "We cannot have an NBA owner discriminating against the league" said Charles Barkley. "We're a black league." Both discussed the issue during the Atlanta Hawks-Indiana Pacers halftime program on TNT which like CNN is a division of Time Warner. Will the NBA make Sterling the first owner to give up team? CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton Joe Sutton and Kevin Dotson contributed to this report. The NBA's commissioner orders Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling out of his team's business over racist remarks. Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off during an AC Milan soccer match in Italy but Dani Alves turned to humor in dealing with racist abuse during a Spanish league game. Dani Alves' response to a fan throwing a banana at him during Barcelona's trip to Villarreal on Sunday drew huge praise from the football world. The players in the National Basketball Association spoke out Sunday about racist comments attributed to Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling is a billionaire real estate mogul who's owned the team for more than three decades. England prides itself on being the home of football but is the nation dysfunctional in dealing with racist abuse? "Move on Jews! Your home is at Auschwitz! Send you to the gas (chamber)!" French soccer star Nicolas Anelka has decided to quit English Premier League club West Bromwich Albion following his punishment for making a controversial "quenelle" gesture. Team owners strongly dispute any racism behind the mascot and won't change it saying the Redskins name honors "where we came from who we are." English football fans have been warned they face criminal prosecution if they continue to chant a word which has been deemed anti-Semitic. FIFA approved tougher penalties for racist behavior including possible relegation in a move that one anti-racism organization said will bring soccer "in line" with other sports.

Alexander Motyl: Putin belligerent about Ukraine as his minister signs accord Motyl: Despite Putin hard line Geneva statement is a major step down by Russia Accord says illegal armed groups must be disarmed; illegally seized buildings returned Motyl: It seems that if you talk tough and act tough Putin may just possibly listen Editor's note: Alexander J.

He writes a weekly blog on " Ukraine's Orange Blues" for World Affairs Journal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- So just what is Russia up to now? On April 17 at the same time Russian President Vladimir Putin snarled at Ukraine and the West at a press conference in Moscow Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed a conciliatory agreement in Geneva with the United States the European Union and Ukraine. On the face of it the foreign minister seemed to repudiate the President and betray the pro-Russian terrorists in eastern Ukraine. Whatever Putin and Lavrov's game the statement signed by Lavrov in Geneva represents a major stand down by Russia. To be sure given the Kremlin's past mendacity and slipperiness the agreement is ultimately nothing more than a piece of paper. If Putin could breach the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances (wherein the United States the United Kingdom and Russia agreed to guarantee Ukraine's security and territorial integrity) he could easily tear up the Geneva statement if and when it suits him.

See the crisis in Ukraine before Crimea voted In his press conference true to form Putin denied the existence of Ukrainians as a separate nation reserved to himself the right to intervene in Ukraine and supported the pro-Putin armed commandos who have caused havoc in eastern Ukraine. Here's Putin on Ukrainians as really being Russians: "The desire to get Russia and Ukraine to quarrel to divide what is essentially a single people has been an object of international politics for centuries." It gets worse. Putin says the fanatical Bolsheviks and their reactionary White opponents agreed on one thing only: that Ukraine and Russia were a "part of a common united space and a single people." And he adds "They were absolutely right." Ukrainians naturally beg to differ. And they worry. If Ukraine has no right to exist as a separate nation then why shouldn't Putin bring Ukrainians "home" whenever he chooses to follow in the footsteps of the Bolsheviks and the Whites? Here's Putin on the right to intervene to "help" Russians and "Russian-speaking citizens" in Ukraine: "But we know exactly that we ought to do everything to help these people defend their rights and independently determine their fate. This is what we will fight for. Let me remind you that the Federation Council of Russia gave the president the right to use armed forces in Ukraine. I very much hope that I will not have to exercise this right and that through political and diplomatic means we will be able to resolve all the acute if not indeed very acute problems in Ukraine today." Unsurprisingly Putin's insistence that he has a right to aid Ukrainian citizens spooks Ukrainians especially as his invocation of that right is coupled with the continued massing of thousands of battle-ready Russian troops along Ukraine's borders. Finally here's Putin on the pro-Russian commandos who have terrorized southeastern Ukraine in the last week and thereby compelled Kiev to try to regain control of the region: "Now we hear of calls (by the West) to the people in the southeast to lay down their arms. ... But then (the Ukrainian authorities should) pull back the army from the civilian population. ... All right the east will disarm all right let's assume the army will withdraw -- why have the (Ukrainian) nationalist groups not been disarmed yet?" One of the central points of the Geneva statement undermines Putin's concerns: "All illegal armed groups must be disarmed; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners; all illegally occupied streets squares and other public places in Ukrainian cities and towns must be vacated." Geneva made it clear that all groups should be disarmed and all buildings and streets be vacated -- immediately. There is no talk in the statement of one side's disarming first and then the other's disarming next. Because virtually no Ukrainian armed groups are in Ukraine nor are they occupying buildings -- the groups have been disarmed in the last few weeks -- the statement applies almost exclusively to the Russian-supported Russian-funded and Russian-directed commando-terrorists. Lavrov also signed the following statement: "Amnesty will be granted to protesters and to those who have left buildings and other public places and surrendered weapons with the exception of those found guilty of capital crimes." This is indirectly a recognition of the Ukrainian government's legitimacy something that Putin repeatedly denied at his press conference. After all who is to capture the terrorists and determine if they committed capital crimes? The Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs the procurator's office and the Ministry of Justice of course. If the government is illegitimate then so too they are illegitimate. Conversely if they are legitimate then so too is the government. President Obama was absolutely on the mark to be skeptical of Russian intentions. "Our strong preference would be for Mr. Putin to follow through on what is a glimmer of hope coming out of these Geneva talks" he said. "But we're not going to count on it until we see it. And in the meantime we're going to prepare what our other options are." Even so the Geneva document is important. It represents a standard against which the reduction of terrorist activities in eastern Ukraine and Russia's behavior toward them can be measured. Thus far the evidence is neither encouraging nor discouraging. Russia insists the Ukrainians have to move first the extremists in Sloviansk and Donetsk have insisted the agreement does not affect them and their comrades in Kramatorsk have seized more buildings . On the other hand extremists in Yenakievo abandoned the buildings they had occupied and the Donetsk separatists have promised to vacate two floors and the conference hall of the state province administration building. Regardless of the desultory response by Russia and its supporters both the United States and Ukraine have correctly insisted that Russia stick to the agreement and convince its supporters in eastern Ukraine to surrender their arms and abandon the buildings they seized. Kiev has also agreed to an amnesty for those extremists who did not as the document insists engage in capital crimes. And Yulia Tymoshenko the former prime  prisoner who is now running for president has used the agreement as the basis for calling on the extremists to engage in roundtable discussions. The next week or two will demonstrate whether Russia is or is not serious about the Geneva agreement. If the terrorist groups do not abandon buildings and give up their arms and if Russia does not stop infiltrating Russian intelligence agents into Ukraine then Putin and Lavrov will effectively be declaring that they cannot be trusted and that their intentions in Ukraine are aggressive. Alternatively if they adhere to the agreement the document could lead to further forms of de-escalation perhaps even including a permanent withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's borders. Opinion: Why Geneva accord on Ukraine is tactical victory for Russia? Are Lavrov and Putin playing good cop-bad cop hoping to convince the United States the European Union and Ukraine that Russia really is reasonable and has no aggressive intentions? If so is this just a ploy to win time while war preparations continue? Or is their routine indicative of Russia's finally coming to its senses? Has Putin realized that invading or destabilizing Ukraine will bring him and Russia nothing except painful Western sanctions and the possible arming of Ukraine's military? Whatever the answer it seems obvious that the West's consistent expressions of support for Ukraine and condemnation of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea along with Kiev's decision finally to resist Russian aggression played some role in convincing Putin to have Lavrov make nice.

Ukraine's Interior Ministry said Ukrainian forces killed the militants during operations to take down pro-Russian activists' roadblocks around the southeastern city of Slavyansk. The Russian response was swift. Russian President Vladimir Putin said "if the Kiev regime has started to use the army against the population inside the country it beyond any doubt is a very serious crime." There would be "consequences" for those making the decisions and for relations between his and Ukraine's governments Putin said at a media forum Thursday according to state TV channel Russia 24.

See the crisis in Ukraine before Crimea voted Shortly afterward Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia would conduct military drills in response reported Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. "We are forced to react to such a development in the situation" Shoigu is quoted as saying. "Starting today exercises of battalion tactical groups from the Southern and Western military districts will begin near the borders with Ukraine." Ukraine issued a 48-hour deadline for Russia to explain its military drills the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Thursday. The ministry did not say what Ukraine would do if Russia does not comply. Ukrainian acting President Oleksandr Turchynov had strong words for Moscow accusing it of "openly threatening" his country with its troop buildup on Ukraine's eastern border. Kiev's security operation is intended to protect peaceful citizens he said but in response Russia "coordinates and openly supports terrorist killers with weapons in their hands" in eastern Ukraine. "With no reason to do so the Russian leadership allows itself to boldly interfere in the internal affairs of Ukraine" Turchynov said. "Russia supports terrorism in our country at the state level." Top U.S. officials -- including President Barack Obama -- on Thursday vowed more punitive international actions targeting Russia's economy if Moscow in their view continues to escalate rather than de-escalate the situation. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's actions "a full-throated effort to actively sabotage the democratic process through gross external intimidation." "If Russia continues in this direction" he added "it will not just be a grave mistake it will be an expensive mistake." According to senior U.S. officials additional U.S. sanctions against Russia could come as early as Friday. Among the targets for the new sanctions are key Putin allies high-profile Russian oligarchs and possibly Russian institutions and companies the officials told CNN. The new sanctions "will be an escalation" said one U.S. official. More violence in eastern Ukraine Fresh clashes Thursday only underscored the volatility of the situation especially with a reported 40000 Russian troops positioned near the Ukraine border. That includes the killing of the five pro-Russian militants and the destruction of three checkpoints around Slavyansk according to the government in Kiev. A police officer was also injured the Interior Ministry said. Meanwhile Stella Horosheva -- a spokeswoman for the self-appointed pro-Russian mayor of Slavyansk Vyacheslav Ponomaryov -- said an attack at an impromptu roadway checkpoint outside the city took the life of one pro-Russian militiaman and wounded another. The pro-Russian unit at the checkpoint told CNN that armored vehicles came to the roadblock but didn't fire with locals setting fire to tires to prevent them from passing. The unit said a sniper killed one member of the "self-defense" group and injured another on their way home from an overnight stint at the barricade. Ponomaryov visiting the site also said a sniper killed one of the pro-Russian activists. The government accused Ponomaryov of threatening to kill anyone possessing a leaflet that the Interior Ministry says asks people "to keep the peace ... not obey illegal orders" and stay inside. CNN hasn't independently confirmed reports of threats against Slavyansk residents. Slavyansk isn't the only city in the eastern Donetsk region -- where some have tried to declare independence from Ukraine -- on edge. Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov accused roughly 70 attackers of trying to take weapons from a Ukrainians military unit in the town of Artemivsk. Security forces fended off the attack. There was also unrest in the eastern city of Mariupol. Turchynov announced pro-Russian protesters had been pushed out of its city hall. But one of those demonstrators Irina Voropayeva claimed that an assault on City Hall by what she said were extreme-right Ukrainians failed. Ukraine's Interior Ministry later stated about 30 people armed with baseball bats entered the building early Thursday demanding the occupiers. As the two groups clashed -- leaving five injured -- police tried to separate them. Five people were injured. Obama: U.S. 'teed up' to impose more sanctions This kind of violence isn't what optimists expected over a week ago after the United States Russia the European Union and Ukraine agreed to a deal that among other things called for illegal groups to disarm and vacate occupied buildings in return for amnesty. The situation has only deteriorated since then as has the war of words. Speaking in Tokyo U.S. President Barack Obama again ruled out any military solution in Ukraine but warned that the United States is "teed up" to impose further sanctions on Russia if it does not abide by the April 17 deal. "There was some possibility that Russia could take the wiser course after the meetings in Geneva" he said. "Instead we continue to see militias and armed men taking over buildings harassing folks who are disagreeing with them and destabilizing the region and we haven't seen Russia step up and discourage that." Kerry sounded off against Russia later Thursday reeling off what he called positive efforts by Ukraine's government to implement the Geneva deal while rapping Moscow for having "refused to take a single concrete step in the right direction." He pointed to "peaceful protesters ... armed with grenade launchers and automatic weapons" self-defense group members wearing "brand new matching military uniforms and speaking in dialects that every local knows comes from thousands of miles away" and the reported arrests of Russian intelligence operatives in Ukraine." Through its actions and "propaganda" Moscow has attempted to undermine "a legitimate political process with the barrel of a gun and the force of a mob that couldn't be achieved any other way" said Kerry. "It is clear that only one side one country is keeping its word" he said. "... The world sadly has rightly judged that Russia has put its faith in distraction deception and destabilization." But Russia sees things differently saying that according to the international deal Kiev must take responsibility for disarming the right-wing ultranationalists that Moscow blames for violence. "We don't have any doubts that the first step must be done by the Kiev authorities" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a news conference. He accused the West of treating leaders in Kiev like "angels" while blaming Russia for the unrest. Putin speaking on Russia 24 said the events unfolding in eastern Ukraine demonstrate that Moscow's decision to support the Crimean people who voted to join Russia last month in a referendum condemned by the West was right. "Otherwise they would have witnessed the same events as eastern Ukraine and surely even worse" he said. "So this is another proof that we have acted correctly and on time."

Police said an investigation unit was trying to determine the circumstances of the shooting. In a major challenge to Kiev's new leaders armed rebels have captured towns and government buildings across eastern Ukraine and are holding a team of European monitors hostage. Western nations accuse Moscow of supporting the separatist gunmen who are occupying official buildings in cities across the region. Sanctions The United States on Monday imposed sanctions against seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in its latest action to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine. The White House said the seven Russians including two from Putin's inner circle are now subject to a freeze on any assets they hold in the United States and a ban on U.S. travel. In addition the United States will deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. The Commerce and State departments will revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions the White House said in a statement. "The sanctions build on the ones that were already in place. We're moving forward with an expanded list of individuals" U.S. President Barack Obama earlier told reporters in Manila Philippines. The move Obama said was to spur Putin to "walk the walk not just talk the talk" in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. If the latest round of sanctions does not work the next phase could target economic sectors like banking Obama said. The European Union also announced Monday that it was imposing sanctions on 15 people who are "responsible for actions which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity sovereignty and independence of Ukraine." A list of the people targeted by the latest sanctions will be published Tuesday and will go into effect at the same time the Council of the European Union said . The sanctions will include asset freezes and travel bans. U.S. and Russian defense secretaries speak U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke on the phone with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Monday. According to a Pentagon description of their conversation Shoigu "reiterated his assurance that Russian forces would not invade Ukraine." Hagel the Pengaton said called for an end to what he described as "Russia's destabilizing influence inside Ukraine" and "warned that continued aggression would further isolate Russia and result in more diplomatic and economic pressure." The Russian government's description of the call said Shoigu "definitively denied the groundless allegations of the presence of Russian sabotage and military intelligence groups on Ukrainian territory" and criticized what he called "anti-Russian hysteria recently unleashed in the Western press." He also criticized what he said was an "unprecedented" increase in activity of U.S. and NATO troops in Eastern Europe near the Russian border according to the Russian government's description of the call. Ukrainian soldier killed A homemade bomb exploded near Ukrainian soldiers who were in the eastern Donetsk region Monday killing one and injuring another Ukraine's Defense Ministry said. The death came days after Ukrainian forces said they killed five pro-Russian militants in an operation to clear roadblocks near the city of Slavyansk last week. Police are investigating Monday's blast the Defense Ministry said. A CNN team covering a pro-Ukraine rally in Donetsk watched violence unfold Monday as pro-Russian separatists wielding batons beat demonstrators who said they wanted to see a united Ukraine. Observer freed Pro-Russian separatists holding a European military observer team in eastern Ukraine released one of the observers for medical reasons Sunday shortly after parading them before cameras. At least seven of the inspectors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe appeared at a news conference staged by Vyacheslav Ponomarev the self-declared mayor of Slavyansk who referred to them as "prisoners of war." The freed observer was from Sweden and had been suffering from diabetes Ponomarev spokeswoman Stella Khorosheva told CNN. Michael Bociurkiw an OSCE spokesman in Kiev called it "a welcome development." The monitors were seized Friday outside Slavyansk one of the flashpoints in the standoff between Ukraine's interim government and pro-Russian factions challenging its authority in the east. They said that although they have diplomatic status they went along with Sunday's news conference because the mayor asked them to. Germany strongly criticized the group's appearance before the media. The "parading of OSCE observers and Ukrainian security forces as prisoners is abhorrent and a flagrant violation of their human dignity" Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement. He added that Russia had a duty to "influence" the separatists so that the other members of the mission could be freed as soon as possible. Putin has repeatedly criticized what he says is Kiev's use of force against Ukrainian civilians.

"Obama_s_Asia_tour",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_02_04_18_EDT",""","U.S. President Barack Obama arrives Wednesday at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo. President Obama says a set of disputed islands fall under a U.S.-Japanese treaty He makes the comments to Japanese paper ahead of a visit to Asia China disputes his assertion saying the U.S. should "respect the truth" Tokyo (CNN) -- President Barack Obama arrived in Japan on Wednesday for the first part of his Asia trip that started with reassuring Tokyo of U.S. support in its bitter territorial dispute with China. Obama made his first stop in Tokyo on a weeklong tour that will also take him to South Korea Malaysia and the Philippines. Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met over what's been described as the "world's best sushi" at Sukiyabashi Jiro a top-rated restaurant in the Ginza district. The dinner also brought out the new U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy. On Thursday Obama will start a formal state visit to the nation -- the highest designation for a foreign leader. Obama's appearances in Japan will be tinged with formality meetings with the royal family a stop at the Meiji shrine and a protocol-bound state dinner. Japan's first state visit by an American president in almost two decades comes as the United States works to reassure Abe and other Asian leaders that the United States remains committed to turning foreign policy focus on them. The "pivot to Asia" that began almost three years ago meant to put a greater emphasis on diplomatic and economic efforts toward Pacific nations to counterbalance China's influence in the region. Obama begins Asia trip with 'the best sushi I've ever had' But Middle East uprisings the Syrian civil war and new diplomacy with Iran have made some Asian leaders wonder when the "pivot" would take shape. At the start of his long-awaited visit Obama waded into a fraught territorial dispute between Japan and China. He told a Japanese newspaper that a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing "fall within the scope" of a U.S.-Japanese security treaty implying the United States could step in militarily in the event of a clash over the territory. It's the first time an incumbent U.S. President has made such a statement on the bitterly disputed islands and comes as Asian nations nervously watch the U.S. response to Russia's incursion into Ukraine. Japan has eyed the Ukraine situation closely. Obama's comments Wednesday should dispel at least some of its worry. "We oppose any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan's administration of these islands" Obama said in answers to questions submitted by the Yomiuri Shimbun. Both Tokyo and Beijing say the islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China are an inherent part of their territory. Taiwan which lies 120 miles (about 190 kilometers) southwest of the islands also stakes a claim to them. Obama's words reiterating statements made in previous years by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton drew a swift rebuke from Beijing. "The United States should respect the truth not take any sides be careful about its words and behavior and uphold peace and stability" said Qin Gang a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. But Obama's comments are likely to provide some reassurance to Japan. The Chinese government has stepped up efforts in recent years to challenge Japan's control of the small rocky islands and the waters and airspace around them. Obama's efforts to reassure Asian allies also extend to his push for the Trans-Pacific Partnership a massive trade deal the White House hopes will open economic channels in the region. In the works for years the Japan portion of the trade deal is not expected to be finalized this week -- due to disagreements between the United States and Japan and a delay in Congress from members of Obama's party. The resistance to approving the trade deal along with another trade pact being negotiated with Europe stems from Democrats' worry the agreements would kill jobs. They're not likely to come on board at least until November's midterm elections. "The President has developed credibility problems in terms of delivering on the congressional support" said Kenneth Lieberthal who handled Asia policy in Bill Clinton's White House and now acts as a senior fellow at Brookings Institution. "My own sense is ... that there's less confidence that the President has (been) effective in dealing with the Congress and that may really be a major issue in finalizing (the trade deal)." Despite the stalemate U.S. officials have remained bullish the deal would be good for the U.S. economy. "This remains a very important aspect of our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region one that holds great promise for the countries in the region as well as for the United States" Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice said last week. "We'll continue to work toward that given its significance to all concerned."

"Obama_stands_by_Japan_s_island_claim",""Thu_24_Apr_2014_06_38_08_EDT",""","In South Korea Obama to pause to remember ferry victims By Jim Acosta and Kevin Liptak CNN April 24 2014 -- Updated 0645 GMT (1445 HKT) President Obama to offer condolences to families of ferry victims Capsizing of ferry that so far has killed 180 people will overshadow his visit to S. Korea In Japan Obama defended his foreign policy moves on Syria Ukraine Obama is on a week-long trip to Asia to reassure Pacific allies on several fronts Seoul (CNN) -- President Barack Obama arrives in South Korea on Friday looking to bolster ties with an ally at a moment when it's reeling from a ferry disaster that killed 180 people at last count. Obama as he often does at home as "consoler-in-chief" will offer support to survivors and victims' families as he pauses from the policy and diplomatic demands of his week-long trip to Asia. Last week Obama called the disaster "heartbreaking" a gesture that was noted and well received within the government in Seoul. The capsizing of the ferry Sewol carrying almost 500 people including high school students on a field trip has occupied most of South Korean President Park Guen-hye's time over the past week. Park has confronted outcry from South Koreans who want answers on why the ferry turned over. A criminal investigation is underway. The ferry disaster will no doubt overshadow some part the original intent of Obama's visit to reinforce ties with a strong U.S. ally in the increasingly important Asia-Pacific region. United front against North Korea Both countries want to display a united front against North Korea which in recent days has stepped up activity at its main nuclear test site possibly in preparation for another underground blast. The North Korean Foreign Ministry this week described Obama's trip to Seoul as "a reactionary and dangerous one as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region." Obama speaking Thursday called on North Korea "to start changing your behavior." "They are the most isolated country in the world. They are subject to more international sanctions and international condemnation than any country in the world. As a consequence their people suffer as much as any peoples in the world" he said. Aims to reassure Pacific allies Obama headed to Seoul from Tokyo where a formal state visit complete with a royal audience and a black-tie dinner was meant to exhibit strong ties between Japan and the United States. White House officials hope the week-long trip to Asia will reassure Pacific allies the U.S. remains committed to turning its foreign policy focus to them. But he has few tangible "deliverables" to take home. In Tokyo at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Obama was pressed on whether he would use military force to defend an obscure set of islands controlled by Japan that are at the heart of a heated regional dispute with China. He said the U.S. security pact with Japan does extend to the islands -- known as Diaoyu to the Chinese -- and insisted his implicit offer to defend them against any Chinese incursion did not amount to drawing a red line around the contested land. "The treaty between the U.S. and Japan preceded my birth so this isn't a red line that I'm drawing" Obama said. "There's no shift in position no red line. Were simply applying the treaty." Obama plays soccer with robot The group of islands and rocks jutting out of the ocean is tiny and uninhabited. But the long-standing dispute over them has sent tempers flaring in Beijing and Tokyo especially in recent years. The area around them in the South China Sea between Taiwan and Okinawa is believed to be rich in oil resources. Senkaku is administered by the Japanese but the Chinese claim they are the rightful owners. The possibility of a war over the islands has been a thorn in the side of the United States which says it is obligated by the common security agreement to back Japan. Obama repeatedly urged that Japan and China seek a peaceful resolution through dialogue. A pivot to Russia and Syria In his second term Obama has had limited success in issuing ultimatums in the hopes of halting aggression from nations like Russia and Syria. But he seized on the line of questioning over the islands to defend his handling of the crisis in Ukraine and Syria's bloody civil war. Warning a new round of sanctions against Russia are "teed up" the President said he doubts Moscow will honor its commitment last week in Geneva to deescalate tensions in eastern Ukraine. "Do I think they are going to do that? So far the evidence doesn't make me hopeful" Obama said at the news conference acknowledging Russia has yet to reverse course in the face of mounting economic pressure. But on Syria Obama said his policy of diplomacy first had a direct effect on the removal of 87% of that country's chemical weapons stockpiles. "The fact that we didn't have to fire a missile to get that accomplished is not a failure to uphold those international norms -- it's a success" Obama said. Asked if he was confident with Obama's assurances on Japan's security Abe pointed to Obama's leadership in rallying the G-7 economic powers to apply sanctions on Russia. The missing plane Seoul is the first of two stops on Obama's tour where citizens are coming to grips with major transportation disasters on Saturday Obama flies to Malaysia where government officials continue to search in vain for the Malaysian Airlines jetliner that disappeared more than a month ago. Those officials have come under withering censure accused of botching the search and keeping family members of those on board in the dark. So far the White House has avoided faulting Malaysian leaders for the efforts instead highlighting the U.S. efforts to help locate the plane. Obama has spoken publicly about the missing plane only once during an interview in mid-March offering U.S. assets to help in the search.
