Pro-Russian gunmen have taken over several key state buildings in eastern Ukraine [AP] Ukraine's foreign minister has accused Russian troops of infiltrating and destabilising the east of the country saying Moscow plans to invade and annex other regions. In an interview with Al Jazeera Andrii Deshchytsia said that Russian "special troops" and intelligence officers were blackmailing and intimidating Ukrainian citizens to create a false impression of popular support for Moscow. The comments came as his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov suggested both sides hold talks under the aegis of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Andrii Deshchytsia Ukraine's foreign minister "Russia believes that such a dialogue could be arranged between the authorities in Kiev and their opponents in other regions " Lavrov told Rossiya-24 TV. OSCE military monitors are in eastern Ukraine following an agreement struck in Genevabetween the US the EU Russia and Ukraine to ease tensions. However staff have been blocked and harassed with one group being arrested by pro-Russian separatists. Deshchytsia said: "Special troops from the Russian army and intelligence have infiltrated eastern Ukraine. These well-equipped groups resort to guns oppression and blackmail to intimidate people ... in an effort to channel them to their own purposes and thus create the false impression that their demands are backed by broad public support." He said that the Geneva agreement "remained on paper" as Russia had done nothing to implement its terms. "Ukraine took certain steps in this regard such as gearing down anti-terrorism operations drafting an amnesty law ensuring evacuation of government buildings and streets seized by various groups embarking on a constitutional reform for local administrative bodies and making things easier for the OSCE mission." "Russia's major goal is to destabilise and control the country. We will not let this happen. Russia wants to hamper the presidential elections in May and also to make the legitimacy of the new government disputable. "They want to destabilise Ukraine. If they cannot achieve that they will want to invade and annex certain parts of Ukraine through a direct military intervention." He said he understood the West would not enter an armed conflict with Russia but that it could do more to stop the Russian machine working. "Western countries should implement tougher sanctions which should target certain Russian sectors. Oil and natural gas revenues allow Russia to arm its military forces and invade territory" he said adding that sanctions should be brought against "decision-makers" including the Russian president Vladimir Putin. The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday announced a $17bn bailout for Ukraine while also announcing that Russia was entering into a recession.

Pro-Russian activists have stormed the prosecutors's office in Ukraine's separatist-held city of Donetsk hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails as the uprising against the interim government in Kiev rages ahead of the May 11 referendum on secession. Several of the out-numbered police officers were injured in Thursday's clashes and in some cases severely beaten as the separatists stripped them of their weapons and shield's AFP news agency reporters on the scene said. "The prosecutor's office was issuing criminal orders from Kiev against its own people charging them with separatism and other fake crimes" one protester a 43-year-old man from Donetsk who gave his name as Igor told Reuters news agency. Rebels quickly took control of the building after mounting a second assault from the back hoisting the Russian flag barricading the front door and burning Ukrainian symbols in the street. The riot police responded with stun grenades tear gas and rubber bullets injuring some rebels but were quickly overpowered. There was no visible sign of live ammunition being used by either side. Once inside the building which was empty for the May 1 public holiday dozens of rebels dressed in civilian clothes and wearing balaclavas tore down official photos and began a search for weapons. 'Helpless' government Donetsk the main city of what separatists call their "Donetsk Republic" was seized from Kiev's control on April 6. The Western-backed government in Kiev has admitted it has effectively lost control of the increasingly chaotic east with Oleksandr Turchynov Ukraine's interim president saying authorities were "helpless" to prevent rebels over-running towns. On Thursday Turchynov announced that military conscription would come into effect immediately "to bolster Ukraine's defence capabilities in connection with aggression from the Russian Federation." More than a dozen towns and cities in eastern Ukraine are already in the grip of the separatists who have vowed to hold a referendum on May 11 on independence from Kiev and closer ties with Russia. The West believes Russia's President Vladimir Putin is pulling the strings in the uprising dismissing his denials that Russian forces are covertly leading rebel assaults. This week the US the EU Japan and Canada imposed sanctions on powerful Russian individuals and firms as punishment for what is seen as continuing interference by Moscow. Russia has reacted angrily but said it would not retaliate in kind at this time.

"UN_lifts_ban_on_Ivory_Coast_diamonds____Tue_29_Apr_2014_17_19_11_GMT____aljazeera.html","News Shows In Depth Opinion Human Rights Video Blogs Sport Investigations Weather Watch Live Africa Americas Asia-Pacific Central & South Asia Europe Middle East Inside Story Witness Listening Post People & Power 101 East The Stream More Focus Features In Pictures Interactive Spotlight Football Cricket Tennis Formula One Golf US Sports Features More Counting the Cost News This month on Al Jazeera UN resolution immediately terminates sanctions imposed in 2005 on diamond imports from the west African nation. The UN Security Council has voted unanimously to lift a ban on importing rough diamonds from Ivory Coast. A resolution adopted by the council on Tuesday immediately terminates sanctions imposed in 2005 on diamond imports from the west African nation. The council noted that the Kimberley Process the international initiative that regulates the diamond trade recognised last November that Ivory Coast had fulfilled its diamond certification scheme's minimum requirements. The Security Council maintained an arms embargo on Ivory Coast until April 30 2015 with exceptions for the UN peacekeeping mission and disarmament efforts and a requirement that the Ivorian government get advance UN approval for any arms shipments. It also maintained financial and travel bans until that date. After an attempted coup sparked a civil war in 2002 Ivory Coast was split into a rebel-controlled north and  south. Hundreds of millions lost A peace deal in March 2007 brought key rebel leaders into the administration but deep divisions remained. The country headed to the brink of civil war in early 2011 when then-president Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede defeat after losing a presidential runoff vote to Alassane Ouattara who finally became presidentin May 2011. Ivory Coast is the world's leading cocoa producer and the world's second-largest producer of cashew nuts. UN experts have said that hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost from smuggling and illegal dealings inthese key commodities as well as timber oil gold and diamonds and a parallel taxation system. The Security Council called on Ivorian authorities to continue taking measures "to dismantle the illegal taxation networks". It welcomed the government's "overall progress towards restoring security peace and stability" but expressed continued concern about instability in the country's west. The council commended efforts by Ouattara and his government to stabilise the security situation accelerate economic development and strengthen international and regional cooperation notably with Ghana and Liberia. It called on all major players in Ivory Coast to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict and urged all illegal Ivorian armed combatants including in neighboring countries "to lay down their armsimmediately". The council said the government urgently needed to train and equip its security forces especially the police and gendarmerie stressing that they must uphold human rights and international law. The council encouraged Ivory Coast to host a Kimberley Process review of its diamond industry within nine months. The diamond industry rights groups and 75 countries have worked together as members of the Kimberley Process since 2003 to impose requirements on its members to enable them to certify rough diamonds as "conflict-free" so that purchasers can be confident they are not funding violence. The project was born after wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia that were fuelled by so-called blood diamonds.

"Philippines_defence_pact_boosts_US_influence____Mon_28_Apr_2014_10_07_14_GMT____aljazeera.html","News Shows In Depth Opinion Human Rights Video Blogs Sport Investigations Weather Watch Live Africa Americas Asia-Pacific Central & South Asia Europe Middle East Inside Story Witness Listening Post People & Power 101 East The Stream More Focus Features In Pictures Interactive Spotlight Football Cricket Tennis Formula One Golf US Sports Features More Counting the Cost News This month on Al Jazeera Signing of deal during Obama trip raises concern over US influence and impact on Manila's already strained Chinese ties. Manila - US President Barack Obama hasarrived in the Philippines in a visit widely seen as a part of Washington's "pivot to Asia strategy." Obama landed justhours after Philippine Defence Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg signed a new military agreement allowing more troops in the country. The Philippine government said the pact was an affirmation "of the robust and enduring strategic partnership between" the two allies. Talking to reporters in Manila Goldberg said that the new agreement would not allow the reopening of US bases in the Philippines something that has been opposed by nationalist forces and is prohibited by the 1987 Constitution. In Depth: US and Philippines sign ten-year defence pact No way home for Filipino 'Amerasians' Toxic trail shadows US-Philippine bases deal But the agreement essentially allows US access to Philippine military bases across the country. Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago chairman of the PhilippinesSenate Committee on Foreign Affairs told Al Jazeera that the agreement has "marginal advantages" for the country and is more beneficial to the US. With the signing of the agreement Santiago said the US "could claim that it has 'contained' China because the Asian countries involved including the Philippines are now bound by their respective agreements with America". "It would make the Philippines sounds as if we are a satellite ally of America" she said. During a joint press conference with the Philippine president President Obama said he goal of the US was not to contain China. "We welcome China's peaceful rise. We have a constructive relationship with China" Obama said. "Our goal is not to counter China our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make international rules and norms are respected and that includes areas of maritime disputes. "Our primary interest is the peaceful resolution of conflict including navigation that allows for continued progress and prosperity. We continue to stand shoulder to shoulder to uphold peace and security in this region and around the world." Philippines president Benigno Aquino said the agreement "reaffirms our countries commitment to mutual defense and security and promotes regional peace and stability." "Both President Obama and I share the conviction that territorial and maritime disputes in the Asia-Pacific region should be settled peacefully based on international law. We affirm that arbitration is an open friendly and peaceful approach to seeking a just and durable solution" he said. Disputes with China Anti-China sentiments have been on the rise in the Philippines which is engaged with Beijing over disputed atolls in the potentially oil- and gas-rich South China Sea with both countries claiming Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal as their own. The Philippines has accusedBeijing of becoming increasingly aggressive in staking its claims to the sea and has called on the US for greater military as well as diplomatic support. China and the Philippines are stuck in territorial dispute While the treaty is seen to boost Manila's confidence in countering the Chinese power Santiago warned that the country must be careful in handling the agreement and avoid the violation of the Philippines constitution. "Filipinos should keep uppermost the supremacy of the Philippine Constitution" she said. "We should not accommodate any foreign power at the cost of the sovereignty of our Constitution even if the problem is presented as if it were a problem of national survival." Activists opposing what they call "US imperialism in Asia" raise the question of sovereignty. They cite a case in 2005 whenfive US soldiers were initially sentenced to life in prison for allegedly raping a Filipino woman before the ruling was overturned by another court and they were set free despite public anger. Another issue that has spiked contempt is the alleged dumping of toxic waste in the northern Philippines supposedly by US military ships which Washington denies. 'Exaggerated threat' Jose Maria Sison the exiled leader of the Communist Party of the Philippines and one of the top opponents of the deal told Al Jazeera that the agreement practically reopens the US bases in the country. "The US military bases shall be practically re-established under the guise of facilities built on Philippine military grounds with the Filipino military personnel practically serving as perimeter security guards and with the Philippine government sharing the costs" he said. Sisonalso said the US "is exaggerating the threat of Chinese aggression in order to justify its pivot to East Asia" while establishing bases in the Philippines and "at the same time claiming neutrality between The Philippines and China". Buthe also said that China "is not helping itself by outlandishly claiming about 90 per cent of the entire South China Sea including its high seas and threatening to grab 90 per cent of the exclusive economic zone and 100 per cent of the extended continental shelf of the Philippines". Speaking toAl Jazeera Dr Francisco Nemenzo a political scientist and former president of the University of the Philippines criticised the negotiators for concealing the details of the agreement. Nemenzo saidthe deal "just legitimises what they [the US] have been doing all these years: allowing the establishment of an American base within a Philippine base which a Filipino commander cannot even enter. "We want to know if the deal is a blanket agreement allowing the US to set up a military facility wherever they want to." Security around the capital for the two-day visit is tight including the ordering of a no-fly zone by the Philippine government during the arrival of Air Force Once.

The IMF has warned that the Ukraine economy faces contraction this year [EPA] The International Monetary Fund has approved a $17bn two-year loan programme for Ukraine as Kiev continues to fight pro-Moscow separatists in the east of the country. Wednesdays action by the IMFs 24-member executive board which includes representatives from Russia and the United States opens the way for an immediate release of $3.2bn to Ukraine which faces deep fiscal problems in addition to months of political crisis . The loans are subject to IMF demands that Ukrainecuts subsidies for fuel reduces its large deficit controls pay rises reduces corruption and reforms itsbanking system. Pro-Moscow separatists seized government offices in more Ukrainian towns on Wednesday a further sign that authorities in Kiev are losing control of the country's eastern industrial heartland that borders Russia. The unrest in the east follows months of upheaval from anti-government protests and Russia's subsequent annexation of the Crimea region which had already pushed Ukraine's economy to the brink of bankruptcy. Christine Lagarde IMF managing director and chair said:Deep-seated  with political shockshave led to a major crisis in Ukraine. The economy is in recession fiscal balances have deteriorated and the financial sector is under significant stress. Risks to the programme are high. In particular further escalation of tensions with Russia and unrest in the east of the country pose a substantial risk to the economic outlook." The international organisation has warned that the Ukraine economy faces a 5 percent contraction this year even with the two-year loan deal. Some of the initial disbursements could be turned around to pay off an outstanding $2.2bn bill for natural gas from Russia which has threatened to cut off fuel supplies to its former Soviet republic according to the AFP news agency. The country already owes the IMF money under previous loan programmes. but the new loan could be used to repay off that. Subsidy cuts urged The IMF has been wary about lending to Ukraine after two previous loan plans since 2008 failed because of the government's lack of adherence to reform conditions set by the global body. It has insisted on the reduction of huge fuel subsidies and improved efforts against widespread corruption in the government. The Ukrainian government in power until elections are held on May 25 has already promised to raise natural gas prices by more than 50 percent from Thursday. However the overthrow of the pro-Russia government of President Viktor Yanukovich in February and the installation of a pro-Western interim government that pledged reforms opened the door to a new loan programme. Acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has promised to implement the IMF-proposed reforms including a fuel hike that will be unpopular and politically difficult to enact.

The United States has imposed sanctions on seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a fresh attempt to force Moscow to back down from its intervention in Ukraine. The White House on Monday said the third round of sanctions in response to the Ukraine crisis was prompted by Moscow's failure to adhere to an April 17 agreement in Geneva on ways to resolve the situation. Officials made clear that sanctions against key sections of Russia's economy will be imposed including the energy and defence sections should Russia send troops massed along the Ukraine border into eastern Ukraine. The seven Russians sanctioned include two Putin allies: Igor Sechin head of Russia's major oil company Rosneft and Sergei Chemezov head of Rostec a Russian state-owned high-tech products company. The 17 companies will be subject to an asset freeze. Russia's Volga Group one of the targeted companies said on Monday that Washington's measures were "politically motivated statements and decisions". The other people named on Monday were Oleg Belavencev who is Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea Dmitry Kozak deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation Evgeniy Murov director of Russia's federal protective service and an army general Aleksei Pushkov a state Duma deputy and Vyacheslav Volodin a Putin adviser. The White House said that Washington would also deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. EU action The US decision coincided with a preliminary agreement reached by European leaders to impose asset freezes and visa bans on 15 more people. The names of those to be added to the list will not be made public until they are published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday. The US has been much more aggressive in the penalties it has imposed on Russia than has the 28-nation European Union which depends heavily on Russia for energy. The EU has previously imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 33 Russians and Crimeans for their part in Russia's seizure of Crimea last month. Armed separatists loyal to Russia have been seeking more autonomy in eastern Ukraine where they haveseized government buildings set up roadblocks or staged protests. On Monday Hennady Kernes the mayor of Kharkiv the countrys second largest city was shot by gunmen and was said to be undergoing surgery according to his office. Kernes was a staunch opponent of the pro-West Maidan movement that toppled President Viktor Yanukovich in February and was widely viewed as the organiser of activists sent to Kiev from eastern Ukraine to harass those demonstrators. But he has since softened his stance towards the new Kiev government and insisted that he does not support the pro-Russia separatists or any annexation of Ukrainian territory.

John Kerry US secretary of statehas urged South Sudan's government and rebel leaders to uphold a months-long promise to embrace a ceasefire or risk the spectre of genocide through continued ethnic killings. Kerry landing in the South Sudan capital of Juba on Friday conveyed the threat of US sanctions against prominent South Sudanese leaders if the violence did not stop. He also sought to compel authorities on bothsides of the fight to put aside personal and tribal animosities for the good of a nation that declared independence three years ago to escape decades of war. Now South Sudan is engulfed in widespread killings that have largely broken down along ethnic lines and are drawing comparisons to genocide. Follow our in-depth coverage of South Sudan It is estimated that thousands of people have been killed since the fighting began nearly six months ago and about one million others have fled their homes. If that continues Kerry said on Thursday it "could reallypresent a very serious challenge to the international community with respect to the question of genocide". "It is our hope that that can be avoided" he said on the eve of his daylong visit to South Sudan. "It is our hope that in these next days literally we can move more rapidly to put people on the ground who couldbegin to make a difference." The violence in South Sudan since last December is largely the result of ethnic tensions between the two tribes that boiled over when Kiir accused Machar of plotting a coup. A month later both sides agreed to a peace deal that eventually fell apart within days. The US and UN are threatening to bring sanctions against both sides of the fighting - including potentially Kiir and Machar themselves.

Hundreds of pro-Russian separatists have stormed the regional government headquarters in Ukraine's eastern city of Luhansk unopposed by police the Ukrainian government says. Kiev has all but lost control of its police forces in parts of eastern Ukraine where pro-Russianactivists have seized buildings in the region's second biggest city of Donetsk and several smaller towns. "The regional leadership does not control its police force" Stanislav Rechynsky an aide to Arsen Avakov the interior minister told Reuters news agency on Tuesday. "The local police did nothing." Rechynsky said the ministry had information that they would next try to take the local television centre. Video footage showed men some dressed in green camouflage fatigues and holding shields walking around what appeared to be the foyer of the government headquarters as hundreds massed outside the building's large wooden doors. Pro-Russian separatists had previously occupied only the local security services' building in Luhansk which they took in early April. Sanctions against Moscow Earlier on Tuesday Russia's foreign ministry said the European Union should be "ashamed" for "doing Washington's bidding" by punishing Moscow with sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. The ministry's comment came hours after the EU imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 15 more names of Russian and pro-Moscow Ukrainian officials including Russia's deputy prime minister deputy chairman of state Duma and chief of staff of armed forces. "Instead of forcing the Kiev clique to sit at the table with southeastern Ukraine to negotiate the future structure of the country our partners are doing Washington's bidding with new unfriendly gestures aimed at Russia" the foreign ministry said. "If this is how someone in Brussels hopes to stabilise the situation in Ukraine it is obvious evidence of a complete lack of understanding of the internal political situation ... and a direct invitation for the local neo-Nazis to continue to conduct lawlessness and reprisals against the peaceful population of the southeast" it said in a statement. "Are they not ashamed?" Grigory Karasin the deputy foreign minister said separately that the United States and EU sanctions were "an absolutely counterproductive trite measure that would force the already critical situation in Ukraine into a dead end" the state-run RIA news agency reported. Russia has not yet announced any steps in response to the new sanctions. Pro-Russians react Vyacheslav Ponomaryov the de facto mayor of a separatist-held town Slovyansk said on Tuesday that he would discuss the release of detained military observers with the West only if the EU dropped sanctions against rebel leaders. The six observers were in Ukraine under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe a democracy watchdog. They were detained last week after separatists said they had found a Ukrainian spy with them. Meanwhile John Kerry the US secretary of state told the Wall Street Journal late on Monday that the Ukraine crisis was centred on the motivations of Russia's president Vladimir Putin. "You almost feel that he's creating his own reality and his own sort of world divorced from a lot of what's real on the ground for all those people including people in his own country" Kerry said just hours after the US administration announced another round of economic sanctions on Russian individuals and companies. The crisis is "an amazing display of a kind of personal reaction to something that just doesn't fit into the lessons learned for the last 60 years or 70 years... It's unfortunate for the Russian people clearly don't fit into the costs that are being attached to this it appears to be so personal to President Putin."

A group of eight European military observers being held prisoner by pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine have appeared in public for the first time since their capture and gave assurances that they were not being mistreated. Seven officers from the observer team and their translator were brought into a room of waiting journalists in the separatist-held administration building in the city of Slovyansk on Sunday. Guards in camouflage fatigues and balaclavas carrying Kalashnikov rifles were also in the room as journalists spoke to the observers.

Schneider said he understood that the self-proclaimed city mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov could use the observers as a bargaining chip. Later one of the men a Swedish national was released by the group on medical grounds. "He has a mild form of diabetes and so we decided to let him go"Stella Korosheva a spokeswoman for the separatist mayor told reporters. Ponomaryov said on Saturday that they could be released in exchange for jailed pro-Russia activists and told reporters that he was heading into talks with the mediators. "In our town where a war situation is going on any military personnel who don't have our permission are considered prisoners of war" he told reporters. Ponomaryov said he was preparing to meet OSCE mediators to negotiate the terms of the group's release. "The mayor of this city granted us his protection and he regarded us as his guests" Schneider told journalists in Slovyansk in eastern Ukraine. "We were accommodated in a cellar. We had to set up conditions for ourselves" said Schneider describing what happened after they were seized. "Since yesterday we've been in a more comfortable room with heating. We have daylight and an air conditioner." "I can tell you that the word of the mayor is a word of honour. We have not been touched." Schneider told reporters that none of the European delegation were sick. "We have no indication when we will be sent home to our countries" Schneider said. "We wish from the bottom of ourhearts to go back to our nations as soon and as quickly as possible." Ponomaryov who was wearing a pistol in a holster and was escorted by two armed bodyguards claimed in the interview that the OSCE observers "are not our hostages -- they are our guests". Asked about Russia's promise to do everything it could to convince the pro-Kremlin rebels in Slovyansk to release the OSCE military observers Ponomaryov said he had "no direct contact with Moscow." Three members of Ukraine's special forces bearing signs of torture have been paraded before the media [Al Jazeera] Captured officers Ponomaryov also said that pro-Russian separatists had separately "arrested" three Ukrainian officers a colonel a major and a captain he said had been sent towards Slovyansk on a spying mission. "There were a total of seven in their group and we arrested three of them. We will swiftly get the four others" he said. Footage has emerged showing the three captured officers bearing signs of torture being paraded before the media in Slovyansk. Ukraine's SBU security service confirmed the three officers had been seized. The rebel mayor said there would be no contact with Kiev over the imprisoned Ukrainians because the pro-Kremlin separatists see the capital's Western-backed government as illegitimate. "There will be no contact with Kiev only through the intermediary of the OSCE" he said. Ukraine's authorities he said "understand only the language of force."

Ukraine's government has said its troops have killed five "terrorists" in operations to take back the pro-Russian stronghold of Slovyansk an operation which has prompted Russia to order new military exercises on the Ukrainian border. The Ukrainian interior ministry said on Thursday that the pro-Russian rebelswere killed as paratroopers took over three "illegal checkpoints" around the town which has been in separatist control for almost two weeks. Videos posted online showed smoke rising from barricades around the town. Reports said that rebels had set fire to the barricades as they abandoned them and retreated from Ukranian forces. The Reuters news agency reported that Ukrainian troops had set up new positions around the town. The AFP agency said that Ukrainian forces had told pro-Russian rebels to leave government buildings they were occupying although this was not confirmed by any other source. The operation prompted Russia to order new military exercises in regions bordering Ukraine. NATO has estimated its deployment at 40000 troops. "We are compelled to react to such a situation" Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian news agencies. "From today military exercises have started in regions bordering Ukraine involving battalions of tactical forces of the southern and western military districts." President Vladimir Putin had warned earlier on Thursday that there would be consequences if the Ukraine army was used against pro-Russian activists. "If Kiev really began to use the army against the country's population... that is a very serious crime against its own people" he said. The operation came hours after the government reported that its forces had taken control of the town hall in the city of Mariupol and repelled an attack on an army base in the eastern town of Artemivsk the ministries said. Separatist sources also reported the loss of the town hall in Mariupol. The city was the scene of a rebel attack on troops last week that left three rebels dead. The separatists had held the town hall since April 13. "The town hall is liberated and can function normally" Arsen Avakov Ukraine's interior minister said on his Facebook page. The Defence Ministry said in a statementthat Ukranian forces repelled nearly 100 separatists in an attack on the military base in Artemivsk just north of rebel-held Donetsk. "The attackers were repelled and suffered significant losses" Oleksandr TurchynovUkraine's actingpresident said. US President Barack Obama said on Thursday that Russia had failed to abide by the spirit of a deal to ease tensions in Ukraine and that new sanctions against Russia were being "teed up". He said "malicious armed men" continued to occupy buildings in eastern Ukraine in contradiction to a deal agreed last week in Geneva by Ukraine Russia the EU and the US. Barnaby Phillips and Peter Sharp report "So far we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva" Obama said. If that continued he said "there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions". On Wednesday Sergey Lavrov the Russian foreign minister warned that Russia would respond if its interests were threatened and made reference to Russias invasion of Georgia in 2008 after Georgian forces attacked separatists in its pro-Moscow region of South Ossetia.

"Ukraine_helpless_to_quell_unrest____Wed_30_Apr_2014_15_15_27_GMT____aljazeera.html","News Shows In Depth Opinion Human Rights Video Blogs Sport Investigations Weather Watch Live Africa Americas Asia-Pacific Central & South Asia Europe Middle East Inside Story Witness Listening Post People & Power 101 East The Stream More Focus Features In Pictures Interactive Spotlight Football Cricket Tennis Formula One Golf US Sports Features More Counting the Cost News This month on Al Jazeera Acting president says police and security forces are "helpless" to quell unrest in two eastern regions bordering Russia. Ukraine's police and security forces are "helpless" to quell unrest in two eastern regions bordering Russia and in some cases are cooperating with pro-Russian gunmen who have seized scores of government buildings and taken people hostage the country's acting president says. Oleksandr Turchynov said on Wednesday his goal now was to prevent the agitation from spreading to other territories. "I will be frank: today security forces are unable to quickly take the situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions under control" Turchynov said at a meeting with regional governors. "The security bodies ... are unable to carry out their duties of protecting citizens. They are helpless in those matters. "Moreover some of those units are either helping or cooperating with terrorist organisations" he said. Turchynov instructed the governors to try to prevent the threat from overtaking more central and southern regions. "Mercenaries and special units that are active on Ukrainian territory have been tasked with attacking those regions. That is why I am stressing: our task is to stop the spread of the terrorist threat first of all in theKharkiv and Odessa regions" Turchynov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Military drills Kiev city authorities meanwhile announced unexpected middle-of-the night military drills starting on Wednesday night to Thursday morning which will involve military equipment further stoking tensions. Russia has placed tens of thousands of troops near the border with Ukraine and Turchynov said the threat of a Russian invasion was real. He called for creating regional self-defence units throughout the country according toInterfax. Some Ukrainians said they were appalled by the loss of control over eastern regions and accused the central government of inaction. "In a normal society when Oleksandr Turchynov admits the fact that the authorities do not control the situation in the east of the country is ground for resignation. And not just of him but all the security forces" ValeriyKalnysh former editor of the Kommersant daily wrote on Facebook. "But can we afford this now? .... And is it the right move in the conditions of an undeclared war with Russia?" Turchynov spoke hours after pro-Russian gunmen seized more administrative buildings in eastern Ukraine. Insurgents wielding automatic weapons took control and hoisted an insurgent flag on top of the city council building on Wednesday morning in the city of Horlivka in the Donetsk region. They also took control of a police station in the city adding to another police building which they had controlled for several weeks. An Associated Press reporter saw armed men standing guard outside the building and checking the documents of those entering. One of the men said foreign reporters would not be allowed in and threatened to arrest those who did not obey orders. Similar guards were also seen outside the police station in the city. The pro-Russian separatists now control buildings in about a dozen cities in eastern Ukraine demanding broader regional rights as well as greater ties or outright annexation by Russia. They are holding some activists andjournalists hostage including a group of observers from a European security organisation. In Luhansk one of the largest cities in eastern Ukraine gunmen in camouflage uniforms maintained control of several government offices they seized on Tuesday. Eastern Ukraine which has a large Russian-speaking population was the heartland of support for Viktor Yanukovych the ousted president who fled to Russia in February. The government that replaced him in Kiev has resisted theseparatists' demands fearing they could lead to a breakup of the country or mean that more regions could join Russia as Crimea did. Kiev and Western governments accuse Moscow of orchestrating the protests in eastern Ukraine. The United States and the European Union rolled out a fresh set of economic sanctions against Russia this week but Moscow has remained unbowed denying its role in the unrest and saying the actions were Kiev's fault.
