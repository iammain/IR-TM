"WASHINGTON, May 15. /ITAR-TASS/. The US does not consider at the moment providing military assistance to Nigeria in search for kidnapped schoolgirls, US National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday.

She noted that the US has already sent a team of 30 people to Nigeria to assist with the search.

“To the extent that they make requests of us or others to provide support, we’re open to entertaining those. But, obviously, as I said at the outset, the most important thing now is to locate the girls,” Rice said.

“There’s no point in sending in any kind of additional support if we don’t know where they are. So that has to be the first order of business,” she added.

In April, radical Islamists from Boko Haram terrorist organization kidnapped around 270 schoolchildren. More than 200 girls still remain hostages at an unknown location."
