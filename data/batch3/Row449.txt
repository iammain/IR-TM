"MOSCOW, May 16 (RIA Novosti) - A three-party meeting of senior officials from Russia, the European Commission and Ukraine may convene on May 26 to discuss energy issues, a spokesman for the EU's executive body told RIA Novosti Friday.

The spokesman said that European Energy Commissioner G?nther Oettinger will meet with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Monday.

Commissioner Oettinger stands ready to hold a trilateral meeting at any time. Due to agenda constraints, an originally planned trilateral meeting at Ministerial level cannot take place on May 22, the spokesman added.

A new proposal has been made to meet on May 26. Currently, a second meeting is prepared, which - if necessary - will be followed by a third meeting before the end of May, he said.

Novak said Thursday that Moscow would be willing to negotiate on the issue of gas prices, provided Ukraine pays off at least part of its massive debt.

Russia, Ukraine and the European Union were unable to agree on gas issues during their three-party talks in Warsaw on May 2. The sides agreed to hold two more rounds of negotiations in the middle and the end of May.

The gas price for Ukraine rose to $485.50 per thousand cubic meters starting from April 1 after Russia annulled two discounts earlier granted to the country. Gazprom spokesperson Sergei Kupriyanov said Ukraine's outstanding gas debt to Russia stood at $3.5 billion as of April 30."
