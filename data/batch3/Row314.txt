"UNITED NATIONS, May 02. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia has come forth with a proposal to pass a statement in support of the April 17 Geneva accords on the Ukrainian settlement urging to immediately stop any violence in the country. 


“I think it would be right to end our meeting with such a statement,” Russia’s Permanent Representative at the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said on Friday at an extraordinary meeting of the United Nations Security Council. The document should urge “to immediately stop any violence, including the use of armed forces in Ukraine’s eastern regions and take serious steps to fully implement the Geneva document. If you are ready to support such statement, we will be ready to support it too.”

No one objected to Russia’s initiative and the United Nations Security Council current President, Oh Joon, who is South Korea’s Permanent Representative, took it into consideration. Closing the two-hour meeting, he asked political coordinators to tackle this issue.

Itar-Tass learnt for well-informed sources in the United Nations headquarters that a closed meeting might be held soon if Russia presented a draft statement.

British Representative Mark Lyall Grant expressed readiness to support a statement in support of the Geneva accords on condition that this document resolutely condemned acts of violence, abductions, murders and seizure of buildings in eastern Ukraine."
