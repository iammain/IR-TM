"BRUSSELS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The G7 Summit set for Brussels on June 4-5 will focus on Ukraine situation, ties with Russia, global economy and energy security, according to preliminary agenda unveiled by the European Union (EU).

The leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, the United States, the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission (G7 leaders) will meet in Brussels in the G7 format.

It is the first time that the EU hosts a summit and that it takes place in Brussels. The two-day meeting, at the Justus Lipsius building, will begin at 8 p.m. on June 4 and end on June 5 around 3 p.m., according to the EU.

The EU is a full member of the G8 and is jointly represented by the European Council President and the European Commission President.

Originally a G8 summit was scheduled to take place in Sochi, Russia in early June under Russian presidency. At their meeting in The Hague, the Netherlands on March 24, the G7 leaders decided to meet in Brussels in June in the G7 format instead.

Presidents of the European Council and of the European Commission will give a pre-summit press conference on June 4 and a closing press conference on June 5 together, with exact time to be confirmed."
