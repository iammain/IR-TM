"At talks with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Trutnev on Wednesday, the top parliamentarian said Washington “continues carrying out a policy of interference in affairs of other countries, of which the events in Ukraine, triggered by backstage manipulations of the United States and the West, testify”.

Kim Yong Nam believes the Ukrainian crisis “must be settled in a peaceful way, on the basis of principles of equality and national self-determination”. Trutnev, who is also the Russian president’s envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District, thanked the North Korean official for his principled position on the issue."
