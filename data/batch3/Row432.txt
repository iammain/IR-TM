"Russia to help Kiev establish dialogue with southeast if it ends military op – UN envoy

Russia will assist Ukraine in establishing dialogue with the southeast if Kiev stops its military offensive there, Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said.

“Stop this military operation, and then we will help you with
  establishing dialogue,” Churkin said in response to a speech
  made at the UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday by Ukraine's
  ambassador to the United Nations, Yuriy Sergeyev.



  In his speech, Sergeyev accused Russia of kindling separatism.


“The problem of the troubled regions will not be solved with
  artillery strikes or bombing,” Churkin stated. He stated
  that the new Ukrainian president must make the right decisions
  which will not lead to a dead-end.



  Churkin also said that Russia is assisting efforts to release the
  detained group of OSCE observers in Ukraine, adding that a
  Russian citizen is among the observers.


We're seriously concerned over the incidents with two groups
  of OSCE observers. A Russian citizen was in one of them,
  Churkin said during the UN Security Council session.


We are taking all the steps within our limits to find and
  free the observers who have still not been released.”


  Meanwhile, Rai News 24 reported that the Italian foreign ministry
  had announced the release of the OSCE observers. However, the
  OSCE could not confirm this information, RIA Novosti said.



  Churkin also called on UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to get
  involved in the process of ending the military action in eastern
  Ukraine.


“UN Security Council members must call on Kiev to finally
  realize the need to consider the interests of all citizens of the
  country, to immediately end the military operation in the
  southeast,” Churkin said."
