"MOSCOW, April 27./ITAR-TASS/. A bomb threat call at the Moscow-based Mosfilm film studio has proved to be hoax, a spokesman for the Moscow police department told Itar-Tass on Sunday.

“Information about an explosive device planted at Mosfilm has proved to be false,” the spokesman said.

An anonymous telephone call warning about an explosive device planted at Mosfilm came to the Moscow police at about 15:40 Moscow time. The police evacuated all people from the site. Police officers and specialists with dogs inspected the premises to find no explosive devices."
