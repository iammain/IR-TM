"MOSCOW, May 19 (RIA Novosti) – Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed the first contacts between the Kiev authorities and federalists in Ukraine as a first step to begin dialogue for reconciliation in the crisis-hit country, the Kremlin’s press service said Monday.

“Russian President [Vladimir] Putin has welcomed the first contacts between Kiev and the federalist supporters with the goal of beginning direct dialogue, in which all of the interested parties will participate,” the service said.

Federalists in the self-proclaimed people’s republic of Donetsk said Monday they do not plan to negotiate with the current Kiev authorities as they have not fulfilled their obligations under existing agreements.

Following a regime change in late February, the citizens of the predominantly Russian-speaking southeastern regions of Ukraine refused to recognize the legitimacy of the country’s interim government and called for federalization, with rallies sweeping through the region.

Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov launched a special operation in mid-April to crack down on pro-federalization protests.

Moscow has called on Kiev to immediately stop the military operation in southeastern Ukraine, expressing hopes that the West will “actively influence” Kiev to start work on national reconciliation in the country."
