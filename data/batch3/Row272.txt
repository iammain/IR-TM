"MOSCOW, May 13. /ITAR-TASS/. A Russian lawmaker said expanding the EU sanctions list over the Ukrainian crisis will not contribute to the settlement.

A varied and thorough dialogue is needed to settle complex conflicts which are now happening in Ukraine, Vladimir Pligin, Chairman of the parliament Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Development, told Echo Moscow radio.

In resolving any conflicts, one has to seek mutual understanding, said Pligin, who found his name on the expanded list of EU sanctions on Monday. Our partners in European communities realize it.

On Monday, the Official Journal of the European Union expanded the sanctions list by adding 13 people and two Crimean companies (Chernomorskneftegaz and Feodosia). The sanctions against Russian companies and officials were effective from the date of publication.

In all, there are 61 persons on the EU's blacklist now. The EU barred their entry into the EU, while their assets - if such are found in European banks, will be frozen."
