"“After a border guard in Borispol found out at the passport check-point that I had arrived from Russia, he took me to some room where another border guard thoroughly questioned me. However, I had answers to all questions he asked,” Petr Parkhomenko himself told Kommersant FM radio on Thursday, noting that he had been heading for Chernobyl, the site of a 1986 nuclear disaster, and not for the restive southeastern Ukraine.

“I had to wait for about an hour in the waiting room, after which they summoned me and said I was denied entry as I could not confirm the aim of my visit,” Parkhomenko said, adding that a border guard service officer refused to explain what exactly documents were missing.

He was then convoyed to the lounge where some 15 other Russian nationals barred from entering Ukraine were waiting for a back flight."
