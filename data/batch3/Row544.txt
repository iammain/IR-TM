"Far-right rally turns into massive brawl on Kiev’s Maidan, shots heard (PHOTOS)

A massive fight broke out on Kiev’s landmark Independence Square (Maidan) on Tuesday night, with shots and explosives being heard, according to Ukrainian media. There are reports of injuries.


  Eye witnesses described over 100 people, reportedly members of
  the far-right Social-National Assembly, marching with burning
  torches towards Maidan – the epicenter of the massive uprising
  that removed former President Yanukovich from power. The marchers
  came to commemorate those killed during anti-government protests
  in December-February.



  Maidan self-defense units blocked the rally at the barricades
  across from the main post office, prompting a massive fight.



  The far-right radicals reportedly used firecrackers, traumatic
  guns, and tear gas. Many of them carried bats and sticks. There
  are reports of injuries, according to Ukrainian media.



  One of the tents at Maidan caught fire, and the blazes were
  swiftly extinguished. Witnesses reported ambulances arriving at
  the scene.



  Eventually, the self-defense units allowed the rally to pass
  through. The march then began to move towards Ukrainian
  Parliament, local television channels reported.



  Nationalist sentiment has been prevalent in Ukraine throughout
  the ongoing crisis. On Sunday, hundreds took part in a march in the western city of Lvov to mark the
  anniversary of the formation of the 'Galician' Ukrainian SS
  division, which fought for the Nazis against the Soviet Union
  during World War II."
