"MOSCOW, May 29 (RIA Novosti) – Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a decree Thursday calling to sign the Eurasian Economic Union Treaty that will finalize the process of establishing a Eurozone-like space of ex-Soviet states.

In the decree, Putin wrote it is “desirable” that the treaty is signed at the meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council at the level of heads of states.

Putin has allowed the Ministry of Economic Development to introduce changes of non-principal character to the document during the negotiations.

The treaty, to be signed in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana Thursday between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, will come into force on January 1, 2015.

The three countries' leaders are also expected to flesh out various aspects of the existing Customs Union and the Single Economic Space.

Bids from other potential member states will also be considered, including Armenia, which said it was hoping to join the Eurasian Economic Union.

The summit will also consider a roadmap for Kyrgyzstan to join the Moscow-led Customs Union and the Eurasian economic zone.

First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov told RIA Novosti earlier that the Russian, Belarusian and Kazakh delegations, working under the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union, have managed to resolve all the differences."
