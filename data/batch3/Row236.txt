"MOSCOW, May 04 /ITAR-TASS/. The West has actually imposed an information blockade on tragic events taking place in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Sunday.

“While Ukrainian punitive squads are carrying out their operations in east Ukraine, conducting sweeps in some settlements and blocking some others, the West has actually imposed an information blockade on tragic events taking place in that country,” the ministry said, adding that “It is quite illustrative that even in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) no one is aware that the blood is being shed in Ukraine and troops are shooting at unarmed people.

Russia demands that the relevant agencies of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe give an unbiased assessments to the development picking pace in Ukraine, ministry said."
