"MOSCOW, April 28./ITAR-TASS/.There are no reasons to use the 2011 Vienna document on confidence - and security-building measures over Russia’s military exercises in districts bordering Ukraine, Russian Foreign Ministry reports.

The Geneva accords do not contain restrictions on Russian Armed Forces’ activity on the territory of the country.

Events being taken in southern and western military districts of the Russian Armed Forces do not need any explanations according to the 2011 Vienna document, the ministry said."
