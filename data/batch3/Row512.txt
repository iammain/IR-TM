"BUENOS AIRES, May 27 (RIA Novosti) – Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua plans to visit Russia this week, determined to sign new bilateral agreements in energy, financial, defense and security industries, Venezuelan state news agency AVN reports Tuesday.

“We will announce the new agreements between the two countries in the energy, financial, commercial and industrial spheres as well as in the field of security and defense,” AVN reported Jaua as saying.

According to the agency, the official visit and talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov planned for Thursday are “part of the cooperation mechanism and political relations” between the two countries.

In early March, Lavrov and Jaua met in Geneva. Back then, the Russian minister said Moscow supported the efforts of the Government of Venezuela aimed at preventing violent riots in the country where mass demonstrations against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro have been held since late 2013."
