New Life of Geneva agreements

Hague emphasized that all parties must fulfill their obligations.

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in an interview with Gazeta Wyborcza  that the refusal of dialogue with Russia would be a big mistake. Worsened situation in eastern Ukraine and bloody clashes in Odessa show that only a few steps set off from an open military confrontation, he warned.

The conflict over Ukraine takes very acute form, which has seemed impossible in Europe. Threat of a new division of Europe is still real, the minister said. Europe should seek all possible ways to avoid open civil war in Ukraine, he added.
