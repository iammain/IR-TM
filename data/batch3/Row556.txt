"MOSCOW, April 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia has warned Ukraine against attempts to undermine the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NTP) regime. It believes that at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty discussion floors there should be no place for the current problems of the authorities in Kiev, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's military security and arms control department, Mikhail Ulyanov, said Wednesday. He was speaking at a discussion on preparations for the NPT 2015 Review Conference.

“We address the Ukrainian delegation with a reminder that it should not mix the forthcoming talks with the problems being experienced by the current authorities in Kiev,” Ulyanov said.

The official added that Moscow was strongly urging the Ukrainian side to refrain from dangerous attempts at undermining the non-proliferation regime.

“We are going to discuss nuclear non-proliferation in detail on May 1, the Budapest Memorandum in particular. At this meeting we will talk about the issues regarding security safeguards”, he stressed.

The Memorandum on Security Assurances was signed in Budapest in order to guarantee Ukraine’s territorial integrity and political independence after the country joined the NPT in 1994."
