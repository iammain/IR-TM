"MOSCOW, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to coordinate actions over the situation in Ukraine.

“I would like us to have a frank discussion of the situation in Ukraine and to coordinate our actions,” he said on Thursday at a working meeting with the Russian leader.

“The crisis is unlikely to be over very soon. It impacts both you and us,” he said, adding that it was necessary to think how to counteract the West’s sanctions. For these ends he suggested internal reserves should be used.

“We are worried over what is happening in Ukraine. Not because we are afraid of anything we are being intimidated with, but because of the developments there,” he said, adding that what had happened in Odessa was beyond understanding."
