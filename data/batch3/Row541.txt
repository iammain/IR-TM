"BERLIN, May 05. /ITAR-TASS/. Germany’s Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has suggested organizing another conference in Geneva in a bid to find a solution for the Ukrainian crisis.

The latest joint agreement on renunciation of the use of force and disarmament of illegal militias, which was signed by Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the United States in Geneva in April, “has not been implemented yet”, Steinmeier told a news channel of the German public-service broadcaster ARD on Monday.

“We do need a follow-up conference, as we should finally and fully agree on the diplomatic ways of Ukraine’s crisis regulation, the minister said.

Steinmeier believes that the international Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) should be given more power and the role of a mediator, as it could help with quelling clashes in certain Ukrainian cities.

“This goal requires eager participation of all the parties to the talks”, the minister said.

 

Ukraine's reaction

Ukraine supports prospects for a next round of talks on deescalation of the situation in the country with participation of Russia, the European Union and the United States, the director of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry’s information policy department, Yevgen Perebeynis, told a news conference on Monday.

“We welcome the initiative to hold a next round of consultations among the parties in the Geneva accord,” he said. “A new meeting, if an agreement is reached, must be held in the same format as the Geneva meeting,” he added.

“The parties at the meeting should concentrate on priorities that would give a possibility for de-escalation of the situation. From our point of view, holding an early presidential election in Ukraine on May 25 would be the priority,” Perebeynis added."
