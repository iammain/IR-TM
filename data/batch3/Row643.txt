"SOCHI, May 13. /ITAR-TASS/. The Russian Railways has objected to a proposal made by Kiev to cut the number of stopovers made by trains running in transit across the Ukrainian territory, Director General of the Federal Passenger Company Mikhail Akulov told journalists on Tuesday.

The Ukrainian railway authorities have suggested cutting the number of stopovers en route transit trains, except the stopovers made at first class or no class railway stations; technical stopovers to replace train locomotive crews without authorizing ticket sale to such technical stopovers have been allowed, Akulov said.

This proposal needs approval by all railway administrations which send transit trains to the territory of Ukraine, including the railway administrations of Belarus, Moldova and the Russian Railways. Our position is that this proposal does not conform to the norms stipulated in the corresponding rules in effect at present. We will refrain from giving our consent to the proposed cuts and will inform the Council on railway transport that Ukraine's notification has been received, Akulov said.

The Federal Passenger company fulfills all its obligations on the formation of passenger trains, including trains running in transit across Ukraine. Our passengers do not have any inconveniences, except border guard control checks made by the Ukrainian and the Russian sides which make decisions on admission or non-admission of citizens into their respective territories, Akulov noted."
