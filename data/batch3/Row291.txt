"MOSCOW, May 13. /ITAR-TASS/. The current political regime in Ukraine should be declared “not only illegitimate, but also criminal”, believes the head of the State Duma's Foreign Affairs Committee Alexei Pushkov.

“The Russian Foreign Ministry has issued a White Book about human rights violations in Ukraine. In fact, it is a Black Book, as Ukraine over the last two months has seen more tragedies than any of the former Soviet republics over the last ten years,” he said.

The violation of human rights, including the right to life, as well as the use of tortures, prevention from exercising the freedom of speech and belief and limited freedom of the press is a reason to declare the government in Kiev criminal.

“We have seen what happened in Odessa on May 2. Our Western counterparts keep claiming that the far-right neo-Nazi threat was insignificant. But now the Right Sector has its own symbol - the burnt House of Trade Unions,” Pushkov believes.

The Russian delegation has sent photos of Odessa victims to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) but the organization “remains shamefully silent, while its chairman is making confusing anti-Russian statements”.

“They want us to agree that black is white,” Pushkov said."
