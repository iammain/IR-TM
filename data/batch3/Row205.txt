"'My husband kills kids with drones': Michelle Obama's viral pic fuels anti-drone campaign

When US First Lady Michelle Obama appeared in a picture supporting the 276 schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria, she was praised for taking a stand against Boko Haram. But others quickly subverted her message and turned it into an anti-drone campaign.


  Michelle Obama appeared in the viral image last week, holding up
  a sign that said #Bring Back Our Girls. The hashtag quickly
  spread online, hitting home with an online audience that had read
  about the tragic kidnapping of the schoolgirls by a radical
  Islamist group.



  Her contribution to the ongoing conversation did not go unnoticed
  by critics of President Obama. Twitter users either photoshopped
  the image or held their own sign, posting pictures that raised
  various concerns on topics ranging from American conservatism,
  sports, and drones.



  The Britain-based non-profit Bureau of Investigative Journalism
  announced earlier this year that, in the five years that Obama
  has been in office, at least 2,400 people across the Middle East
  have been killed by drones. Even critics admit that many of those
  may have been militants, although the strikes have unleashed
  unimaginable devastation on civilians and their families -
  particularly in Pakistan, where drones have greatly contributed
  to anti-American sentiment.

    Shame Michelle Obama isn't also rightly 'outraged' when her
    husband kills girls with his drones. #DroneStrikespic.twitter.com/2pCS8Fmji7
