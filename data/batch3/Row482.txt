"Obama’s visit to Afghanistan is expected to last only several hours. The visit’s schedule does not include any trip to Kabul or a meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who will abandon his duties soon. However, the president plans to meet with American servicemen deployed in Afghanistan, to visit the wounded in the hospital and hear the commanders’ reports about the course of the counter-terrorism mission.

Obama’s visit coincides with the Memorial Day, which is a national holiday in the USA celebrated on the last Sunday of May. On this day, the Americans traditionally commemorate their fellow-countrymen, who died in wars ever conducted by the USA."
