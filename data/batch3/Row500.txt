"SHANGHAI, May 21 (RIA Novosti) – Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes that Russian-Iranian cooperation will continue despite international turbulence around Iran.

I presume that we will be able to continue this work, despite the turbulence in international relations and around Iran, Putin said at a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani Tuesday.

The leaders met on the sidelines of a summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia.

Putin said that Russia and Iran are not only neighbors, but also long-standing reliable partners. We have already implemented a number of major projects, we have other options, the Russian leader said, adding that Russia and Iran bear great responsibility for the situation in the Caspian region.

In turn, Rouhani said that since his last meeting with Putin in Bishkek last September, the region has faced challenges. He expressed the hope that Russian-Iranian cooperation in recent months has reduced the threat of armed conflict in the region.

Rohani said that relations between the two countries in recent years have become more warm and trusting. The Iranian president also said that he treats Russia not only as a neighbor, but also as a partner with whom the Caspian region can be made more peaceful and stable.

We are for omnidirectional development of cooperation, the Iranian president said, expressing confidence that cooperation between the two countries would be beneficial to the peoples of all countries in the region.

Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak earlier said that Russia and Iran have made progress on jointly discussing cooperation during the International Energy Forum in Moscow, but failed to reach a deal to expand trade and economic ties and a potential oil-for-goods swap.

The Russian minister said Iran is currently developing tools for mutual payments for equipment allowing increasing bilateral trade, which is still affected by the continuing sanctions against Tehran."
