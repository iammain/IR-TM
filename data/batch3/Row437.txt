"MOSCOW, May 27. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia is ready to cooperate with all political forces represented in the European Parliament, Russia's Ambassador to the EU Vladimir Chizhov told a Moscow-Brussels video bridge on Tuesday.

Commenting on the results of European Parliament elections, the diplomat said they were generally expected.

“The European Parliament has never been a very easy partner,” he said. “ But we had to work with the deputies elected by voters. The same holds true for now,” he added.

“Those who are interested in cooperation with Russia will find a constructive partner here,” Chizhov added."
