"If war is politics by other means, Twitter is flipping the bird by other means. While Russia feuds with the U.S. and its NATO partners over the crisis in Ukraine, the official Twitter account of Russia's foreign ministry has started parroting a hashtag first propagated by the U.S. State Department.

It began with this tweet from the State Department's deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf in March, heralding the #UnitedforUkraine meme:

As the President said today, we're proud to stand #UnitedForUkraine and bring the world together to speak w/one voice pic.twitter.com/v8haCIgYLL— Marie Harf (@marieharf) March 26, 2014

Then it got renewed impetus this week:

The world stands #UnitedforUkraine. Let’s hope that the #Kremlin & @mfa_russia will live by the promise of hashtag— Jen Psaki (@statedeptspox) April 24, 2014

But the Russians could play this game, too. In the past 12 hours, the Russian Foreign Ministry Twitter account in English (@MFA_Russia) offered these ripostes:

#Russia urges US to make Kiev stop army operation in southeast of http://t.co/7StSp4Ot8V#UnitedForUkraine@RusEmbUSA— MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) April 25, 2014

It pinned the hashtag on statements made by Moscow's envoy at the U.N.:

#Churkin: #Russia may convene extraordinary UN Security Council meeting on #Ukrainehttp://t.co/h63nnHl7wO@UN@PressRUSUN#UnitedForUkraine— MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) April 25, 2014

#Churkin: Kiev authorities did not even try to bring people to negotiating table http://t.co/eBbw2mS2zP#UnitedForUkraine@PressRUSUN— MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) April 25, 2014

#Russia Ambassador to #UN: The key task now is to de-escalate the conflict #UnitedforUkrainehttp://t.co/K2WCMFezta@PressRUSUN@UN— MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) April 25, 2014

The Russian Embassy in Ottawa got in on the act as well:

And, for good measure, the hashtag got an airing alongside a statement from Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov:

#Lavrov: Moscow to block distortion of Geneva accords on #Ukrainehttp://t.co/v6VzgqJHge#UnitedForUkraine— MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) April 25, 2014

This sort of banter is not unusual for the Russian ministry's account, which has sparred with European foreign ministers including Sweden's Carl Bildt and Poland's Radoslaw Sikorski — both prolific tweeters.

In March, when Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry went for a stroll on the sidelines of talks, the @MFA_Russia account offered these two droll comments as the diplomats disappeared and returned kicking a soccer ball:

Lavrov and Kerry. Hope they will be back pic.twitter.com/ZXDFNSCzhE— MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) March 14, 2014

Game on, indeed."
