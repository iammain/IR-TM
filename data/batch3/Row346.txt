"LUGANSK, May 11 /ITAR-TASS/. Ukrainian law enforcers have blocked delivery of ballot papers to several districts for voting at a referendum on determining the status of east Ukraine’s Lugansk Region on Sunday.

“Law enforcers on armoured personnel carriers have blocked the delivery of ballot papers to Belovodsk, Markovka, Svatovo, Melovoye, Troitskoye districts” in Lugansk Region, head of the Lugansk regional central election commission Alexander Malykhin told a news conference on Sunday, noting that “There is no opportunity to hold a referendum at these settlements.”

“A referendum is certainly taken as a big holiday,” Ukrainian lawmaker Oleg Tsarev told Itar-Tass on Sunday, noting that “A high turnout is reported. People are going to vote in a good mood, smiles are seen on their faces.” Tsarev also added that voting was going very actively. “Everything is peaceful, calm and people are going to vote with whole families,” he noted, adding that no provocations were reported in the region. “All fighters of people’s militia are on duty and are controlling order. No provocations were reported in Lugansk Region yet,” he noted."
