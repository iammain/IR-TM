"BERLIN, May 26, 22:20 /ITAR-TASS/. Russia is ready to continue talks on the price of gas being supplied to Ukraine, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after three-party gas talks in Berlin.

Russia and Ukraine have agreed that Kiev will partly pay its gas bills from November to April, inclusively, and from June to May, Novak said.

“The total amount of payments can reach 2.5 billion U.S. dollars. We are ready to continue discussing prices for gas which we deliver to Ukraine. We hope that the Ukrainian side will discuss our proposals with its leadership,” Novak went on to say.

“Other topics for discussion include financial assistance to Ukraine. The European Commission representatives informed us about the funds that were being allocated for the purpose,” the Russian energy minister stressed, adding Russia would continue meeting its contractual obligations to supply gas to Ukraine and the European Union.

Russia “is doing everything to ensure reliable supplies of gas to European consumers,” Novak said.

“Russia fully meets its commitments,” he added."
