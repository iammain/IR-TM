"MOSCOW, May 28 (RIA Novosti) – Ukraine must immediately move to stop violence and launch nationwide dialogue following last Sunday’s presidential vote in the country, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists Wednesday after talks with his Argentinian counterpart in Moscow.

“We share the opinion [with Argentina’s foreign minister] that in view of the May 25 election, which has taken place, there is a need to use this situation to immediately stop the use of the army and any other violence and start a broad all-Ukrainian dialogue involving all the political forces and all the Ukrainian regions,” Lavrov said.

Russia’s top diplomat has called for constitutional reform in the country aimed at stabilizing the situation and creating a framework acceptable for all Ukrainians.

Lavrov noted the increasing reports of the violation of minority rights in Ukraine and the rising xenophobia and neo-Nazism in Russia’s western neighbor.

“Russia appreciates the independent and substantive stance of Argentina regarding what is happening in Ukraine. This is an objective and unbiased position shared by the majority of Latin American countries,” Lavrov told Argentina’s Hector Timerman.

The May 25 early presidential election in Ukraine came amid a large-scale military operation launched by the Kiev regime to crack down on protesters in the east refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the government.

Ukrainian troops have resumed the Kiev authorities' special operation in the east of the country, which had been suspended for the presidential election, acting Deputy Prime Minister Vitaliy Yarema said Tuesday.

After claiming victory in the election, billionaire Petro Poroshenko said the special operation in eastern Ukraine should continue and become more effective. The statement came as Lavrov warned that a resumption of the operation in eastern Ukraine would be a tremendous mistake."
