"KIEV, May 04 /ITAR-TASS/. Four largest plants in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, including the Novokramatorsky machine-building plant, Energomashspetsstal metallurgical plant, Kramatorsk heavy instrument-making plant and the Starokramatorsky machine-building plant were suspended, local media reported on Sunday.

“Several enterprises which have no equals in Ukraine and at which up to 50 thousand people work and which have orders for unique machinery with dozens of countries in the world plan to resume their operation on Monday,” local media quoted the emergency headquarters formed at the city council as saying. Reasons for suspension were not made public.

These news reports cannot be confirmed yet. No one answers the phone in the emergency headquarters and the directorate of the Novokramatorsky machine-building plant.

Ukrainian troops were reported earlier to resume Saturday a punitive operation which claimed six people in the city of Kramatorsk. The health care department in east Ukraine’s Donetsk region stated that all of them died of gunshot wounds. No less than 15 people were wounded."
