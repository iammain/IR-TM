Chairman and CEO of U.S. metallurgical company Alcoa Inc Klaus Kleinfeld refused to participate in the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in 2014. The decision was taken over U.S. authorities’ pressure, the Alcoa press service told reporters on Thursday.

Alcoa is ranked as the third largest world aluminium producer.
