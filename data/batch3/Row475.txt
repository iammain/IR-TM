"KIEV, May 29. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry has turned down an official note of the Russian Foreign Ministry asking for permission to provide humanitarian aid to residents of Ukraine’s eastern regions.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Moscow should better “focus on satisfaction of numerous requests for humanitarian aid from the residents of the Republic of Crimea.

Kiev dubbed Russia’s aspiration to help civilians suffering from the military operation in the country’s east as “another element of propaganda.

“On May 28, the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation sent a note to the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine, attracting attention of the Ukrainian authorities to the fact that Russia has been repeatedly receiving requests from citizens and organizations from the conflict zone in Ukraine’s eastern regions where many people are killed and many are wounded in combat operations,” the Russian ministry said. “(Russia) has been requested to provide urgent humanitarian aid, first and foremost of medication and medical goods.”

“Russia is ready to provide the population in those regions with everything needed, and asked Ukraine to take necessary steps for ensuring urgent deliveries of Russian humanitarian aid to conflict-hit regions in the shortest term possible,” the Russian note underscored."
