"KIEV, May 26 (RIA Novosti) – The presidential election in Ukraine saw a voter turnout of 60.3 percent with one constituency in the eastern Donetsk region not included in the final tally, the country’s election authority said Monday.

The western Lviv region saw the highest turnout of 78.2 percent, while 62.7 percent of registered voters in the capital Kiev voted in the election.

Eastern regions saw low turnout: 38.9 percent in the Luhansk region and 15.4 percent in the Donetsk region.

Voting took place in a total of 189 constituencies, according to the head of the Ukrainian Central Election Commission, Mykhaylo Okhendovsky, who added that he still expects to receive data on the voter turnout in a constituency in the Donetsk region.

The May 25 early presidential vote and regional elections came amid a large-scale military operation launched by the new Kiev authorities to crack down on protesters refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the government.

Twenty-one candidates ran in the race. With 60.15 percent of ballots counted by Monday afternoon, billionaire Petro Poroshenko was leading in the race, with 53.72 percent of the vote."
