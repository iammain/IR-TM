"MOSCOW, May 26 (RIA Novosti) – The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said Monday its observers had found Sunday's elections in Ukraine to be in line with international standards.

The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly said in a statement the vote “was characterized by high turnout and a clear resolve by the authorities to hold what was a genuine election largely in line with international commitments and that respected fundamental freedoms, despite the hostile security environment in two eastern regions of the country.”

Unfortunately, many citizens were prevented from voting in Donetsk and Luhansk, as were nearly all in Crimea, due to the ongoing threats to Ukraine's territorial integrity, said Ilkka Kanerva, head of the OSCE PA delegation.

However, the impressive turnout in the rest of the country offered a powerful rebuke to those who would challenge Ukraine's unity and progress.

The early presidential vote came amid a large-scale military operation launched by the new Kiev authorities to crack down on protesters refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the government.

Twenty-one candidates ran in the race. Billionaire Petro Poroshenko leads in the race, with over 50 percent of the vote after most ballots had been counted."
