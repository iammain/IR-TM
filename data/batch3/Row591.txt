"MOSCOW, May 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia’s Investigative Committee pledges to sue those guilty in deaths of civilians and children in Ukraine in line with the international laws.

“Those guilty in deaths of civilians and children must be prosecuted in line with all the provisions of international law,” spokesman for the Investigative Committee Vladimir Markin said on Friday. “And if not a single state in the world is capable to admit the evident facts that the Ukrainian authorities have been acting as criminals, Russia’s Investigative Committee will shoulder this responsibility by opening a criminal case.”

“The Investigative Committee is to start collecting evidence on each person involved in the crimes against peace and security of the humanity rather than just admitting facts of crimes against civilians,” he said.

“If politicians in Kiev and in the West prefer to live inside the propaganda reality, in the children’s story about the emperor’s new clothes, so these are their problems,” he said. “Here, in Russia, we will look into the facts with sober eyes, including the obvious reality of the country’s dismemberment and Ukraine’s failure to protect interests and freedoms of its citizens.”

Russia’s Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case over instances of banned methods and tactics used by unidentified servicemen of the Ukrainian armed forces, the National Guard and militants of the ultranationalist Right Sector movement in the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, Markin said.

“Russia’s Investigative Committee has instituted a criminal case against unidentified servicemen of the Ukrainian armed forces, the National Guard and the Right Sector on charges of shelling the cities of Slaviansk, Kramatorsk, Donetsk, Mariupol and other localities around Donetsk and Lugansk and envisaged by Article 356, Part 1 of the Russian Criminal Code /use of banned methods and tactics of war/,” he said."
