"MOSCOW, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – Russia and Bahrain have agreed that conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa should be resolved peacefully through broad dialog, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday.

The statement followed a meeting in Moscow between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Bahrain’s First Deputy Prime Minister and crown prince Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa, who is also Vice Commander-in-Chief of the country’s armed forces.

“The meeting centered around the current situation in the Middle East and North Africa with a focus on the Persian Gulf, Syria, Libya and outlooks for the Iranian nuclear program,” the statement said, adding the existing “deep social and political problems in the region must be approached peacefully and in the framework of a broad dialog.”

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Bahraini officials asked Lavrov about Russia’s view on the Ukrainian crisis.

In February, the Ukrainian parliament backed by a far-right movement ousted President Viktor Yanukovych and scheduled an early presidential election for May 25.

Moscow has described the uprising in Kiev as an illegitimate fascist coup and a military seizure of power, which resulted in it taking steps to protect ethnic Russians in Ukraine, including the reunification with Crimea."
