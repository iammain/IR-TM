"SHANGHAI, May 21, 11:28 /ITAR-TASS/. An official of the Russian Foreign Ministry did not confirm reports that countries in the Asia Pacific, primarily Russia and China, discuss creating a joint missile defense system.

“I hear about this for the first time,” Director of the Department for Asia-Pacific Cooperation at the Russian Foreign Ministry Bakhtier Khakimov told reporters.

“It is clear that we oppose 'an Asian missile defense system' which the US calls for. This is also the fact that most Asian countries are against a missile defense system,” the Russian Foreign Ministry’s department head said."
