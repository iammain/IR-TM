"MOSCOW, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – The European Union has decided to sanction another 15 Russian and Ukrainian individuals for their role in the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reported, citing diplomatic sources.

The newly-sanctioned officials, who have not yet been identified, will be subject to visa bans and asset freezes and will be added to a list of 50 individuals who were already named in sanctions earlier this year, AFP quoted sources as saying.

The US announced an expansion of its separate sanctions list on Monday, adding seven high-ranking Russian officials and 17 Russian companies.

The individuals included in the US sanctions were: Russian Presidential Envoy to Crimea Oleg Belaventsev, Rostech CEO Sergei Chemezov, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, Director of the Federal Protective Service of the Russian Federation Yevgeny Murov, Chairman of State Duma Committee on International Affairs Alexei Pushkov, Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, and First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office Vyacheslav Volodin.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly warned that talking in the language of sanctions is “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warned its Western partners about the “boomerang effect” that sanctions would have."
