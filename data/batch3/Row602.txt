"BRUSSELS, May 09. /ITAR-TASS/. The European Union countries have agreed in principle on a possibility of imposing additional sanctions against about 15 more Russians and 5 Crimean companies. A source in the Council of the European Union told ITAR-TASS on Friday that such political agreement had been reached at a session of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union (COREPER) in Brussels.

A practical decision to impose these extra sanctions may be passed at a meeting of the European Union’s foreign ministers in Brussels on May 12, the source said."
