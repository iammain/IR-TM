"“We believe that the main condition for resolving the crisis in Ukraine is to stop the unlawful actions of the Kiev authorities who must realize their responsibility for everything that was written down [in Kiev] on February 21 and in Geneva on April 17. It says clearly that there must be no violence. The use of the army, with the support of radical nationalists, against the people is an absolutely unacceptable form of violence. Moreover, I think this is a criminal decision,” he said.

“It [the agreement] also speaks of the need to disarm these national radicals after all and calls for fighting terrorism, religious intolerance and anti-Semitism,” the minister said. “It also says that a truly comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue must be started. We see none of this happening.”

“I have no doubt that our American partners can influence the people who have proclaimed themselves a government in Kiev. The anti-terror operation was announced immediately after the behind-the-scene visit to Kiev by the CIA director, and the Easter break in this operation announced by Kiev was broken right after [US] Vice President Joe Biden’s visit there. By the way, Joe Biden met with the leadership of the country basically as a head of state holding an internal meeting. He sat at the head of the table with Ukrainian officials flanking him on both sides,” the minister said.

“I am convinced that our American colleagues can and should use their influence to make the present Kiev authorities not just realize but fulfill their responsibility for what is happening,” Lavov said."
