"“We should do everything possible to keep the track of negotiations,” Mangold said on Wednesday on the eve of St Petersburg International Economic Forum.

“I’ll take part in the conference as it was scheduled earlier,” he added.

“I’ll go there because I have my own economic agenda,” Mangold said.

Over years he was chairman of the Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations. The Committee protects the interests of German business in the Central and East European countries, as well as in Central Asia.

“We maintain contacts in many fields that should be continued now,” Mangold said."
