"Representative elections were held in Ukraine. According to OSCE observers’ elections were generally in line with international standards. In turn, Russia has made some positive steps, welcoming the results of these elections and moved its troops from the border with Ukraine. Under these conditions, the introduction of new sanctions has no reason. We however will closely watch the practical actions in the further development of the situation in Ukraine,  he stressed.

However, EU statement says: We have agreed to continue to prepare for possible further steps (to impose restrictive measures against Russia ), if the circumstances require it. The statement also stressed that EU leaders welcomed the ongoing preparatory work of the European Commission and the European External Action Service on possible targeted measures against Russia."
