"KIEV, May 28. /ITAR-TASS/. Kiev has resumed call-up for compulsory military service, planning to draft 1,308 conscripts, the press service of the Kiev administration said Wednesday.

The newly drafted conscripts are to be sent from Kiev call-up centers to the assigned military units from June 4 until July 31, 2104.

Last October Viktor Yanukovych by his decree revoked the obligatory call-up that was envisaged in a state program of the army reform until 2017.

In March 2014, the Ukranian media said that the number of army volunteers had sharply increased because of continuing confrontation in the south-east of Ukraine. Volunteers even queued up in lines to the call-up stations, reports said.

The Verkhovna Rada resumed the call-up in April 2014. The Verkhovna Rada said in its resolution that volunteers should be drafted to serve at military units in reserve and instructed to organize training centers for such servicemen. Afterwards, parliament-appointed president Oleksandr Turchynov issued a decree that envisaged measures to improve Ukraine's defense potential. All men, physically fit for military service in peaceful time, shall be drafted to the army and other military formations in Ukraine, the decree said.

The military service in Ukraine is compulsory for male citizens aged 18-25 with no restrictions for medical reasons."
