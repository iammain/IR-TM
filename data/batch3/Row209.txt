"MOSCOW, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has suspended supplies of arms, military hardware and its components to Russia since March, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov said Saturday.

Russia cannot receive arms that have been prepaid, the Itar- Tass news agency quoted Borisov as saying.

Components for Russia's military-industrial complex at present amounted to about 50 billion roubles (143 million U.S. dollars), he said.

Borisov said such action might negatively affect Ukrainian enterprises.

Russian enterprises, however, were successfully dealing with the difficulties caused by the supply ban, Borisov said. We are to revise all positions of our cooperation, he said.

Moscow and Kiev accused each other of inciting unrest in Ukraine's southeastern regions. After Petro Poroshenko was elected as president of Ukraine earlier this week, Russia has repeatedly warned Kiev against military actions in those regions, saying a humanitarian catastrophe was haunting.
