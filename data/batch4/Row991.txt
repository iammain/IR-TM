"MOSCOW, May 19 (RIA Novosti) – The European Union’s sanctions are impairing joint efforts to settle the crisis in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday.

“The sanction logic by the European Union doesn’t fit in with today’s reality on the continent, in Ukraine and around it, but only impairs joint efforts to help the Ukrainian people in overcoming the deep internal government crisis affecting the country,” Lavrov said during a joint press conference with his Slovak counterpart Miroslav Laj??k.

The EU added two Crimean companies and 13 individuals to a Russian sanctions list last week over the escalating situation in Ukraine. In total, the EU sanctions now target 61 people, including high-ranking Russian officials.

The EU has said it has a three-stage sanctions process. The third stage, not yet reached, would be broad economic sanctions against entire sectors of the Russian economy.

Moscow has repeatedly stated that the language of sanctions is “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warned its Western partners about the “boomerang effect” that sanctions would have."
