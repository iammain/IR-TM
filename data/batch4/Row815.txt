"MOSCOW, May 20 (RIA Novosti) – Ukraine must implement the roadmap of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and halt domestic military actions or the upcoming presidential election may aggravate the crisis in the country, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said Tuesday.

Without the implementation of the agreements that were reached, and the immediate cessation of the military units' actions in the southeastern regions, the upcoming elections on May 25 may aggravate the contradictions in the country, Karasin said in a Foreign Ministry statement after a meeting with British ambassador to Russia Tim Barrow.

The two diplomats discussed the possibility of international collaboration in searching for a way out of the Ukrainian crisis.

Ukraine saw a regime change in February when the country’s parliament, backed by far-right movements, voted to strip President Viktor Yanukovych of his powers, amended the constitution and scheduled early presidential election for May 25. A total of 23 candidates were registered to take part in the vote, but several candidates later withdrew.

In the run-up to the elections, federalist and nationalist forces have clashed in several deadly skirmishes in the south and east of the country, especially in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which declared independence after referendums earlier this month. Pro-federalization activists have accused Kiev of launching special operations involving military helicopters in the regions.

Russia has already expressed its concern over the special forces operation in the southeast of Ukraine, which blocks any real step to de-escalate the situation in the country, the statement said.

The ministry also underlined the need for a nationwide dialogue in Ukraine to discuss constitutional reform according to the Geneva agreement of April 17."
