"ASTANA, May 29 (RIA Novosti) – Russian President Vladimir Putin has urged the full consideration of Armenia’s bid to enter the fledgling Eurasian Economic Union (EAU), saying the deal should be signed in the near future.

“This document needs to be endorsed and signed as soon as possible,” Putin said on the heels of a Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan.

Putin stressed that Armenia is aiming to seal the deal in June. “We hope Armenia will be able to become a full member of the union soon after its launch,” he added.

Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan earlier said his country was likely to sign the treaty before June 15.

An agreement to establish an EU-like Eurasian Economic Union of former Soviet states was inked earlier on Thursday by leaders of Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. It is to come into force on January 1, 2015.

The binding treaty is expected to raise EAU member states to a completely new level of integration. Signatories commit to guarantee the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor, as well as the implementation of coordinated policies in key sectors, including energy, industry, agriculture and transport.

In late April, the presidents of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan ordered the preparation of a draft agreement on Armenia’s membership in the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space by June 1. The surprise U-turn in Armenia’s policy came after it had declined to sign an EU association agreement last September, opting to join the Russian-led Customs Union instead."
