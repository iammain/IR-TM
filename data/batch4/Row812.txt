"MOSCOW, May 19. /ITAR-TASS/. Slovakia’s approach towards starting reverse gas flows to Ukraine does not run counter to the agreements with Russia, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.

“Of course, we follow discussions on reverse gas flows to Ukraine from the countries that buy Russian gas because there are intergovernmental agreements and contracts,” he said after talks with Slovak counterpart Miroslav Lajcak on Monday.

“The Slovak government’s position does not violate the agreements with Gazprom and with the Russian government, that is why we have no claims,” Lavrov said.

Slovakia is preparing a line for gas reverse flows to Ukraine, Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak said.

“Ukraine asked us to help prepare routes for gas diversification. We consider this proposal useful and normal,” he said.

“Our task is to supply gas. This is a commercial operation. We want it comply with the norms of international law. Gas supplies themselves are not a question to us,” Lajcak said."
