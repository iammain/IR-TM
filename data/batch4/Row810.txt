"BRUSSELS, May 20 (RIA Novosti) – The EU powerful executive branch, the European Commission, announced Tuesday it will send a second tranche of macro-financial support to Ukraine worth 500 million euros ($684.25 million) in coming weeks.

“A further ˆ500 million is expected to follow in the coming weeks, once the necessary legal procedures in Ukraine have been finalized, notably the ratification of the Memorandum of Understanding and of the Loan Agreement by the Ukrainian Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada,” the European Commission said in a statement.

The European Commission transferred the first loan tranche of 100 million euros ($137 million) to Ukraine on Tuesday, as part of the 1.6 billion euro ($2.2 billion) macro-financial assistance loan program to prop up Ukraine’s beleaguered economy.

The European Union is fully committed to helping Ukraine address its major economic challenges. This first disbursement marks an important step towards turning that commitment into reality. This assistance, which will soon be followed by a further ˆ500 million, provides much-needed support to Ukraine's efforts to cover its external financing needs, European Commission Vice President Siim Kallas said.

In a bid to forestall Ukraine’s looming balance-of-payments crisis, the European Commission announced in March it would provide Ukraine with 11 billion euros ($15 billion) over two years.

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the credit was designed to enable “a committed, inclusive and reforms-oriented government in rebuilding a stable and prosperous future for Ukraine.”"
