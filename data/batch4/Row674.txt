"“There are positions where we cannot completely avoid using the dollar, but there are also those where we should reduce its use and replace by the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Vietnamese dong, and so on,” Ulyukayev said. “This is quite normal between countries having full-fledged trade and investment relations.”

Speaking about the forthcoming meeting of trade ministers of Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation states in China, Ulyukayev said participants would discuss a whole range of trade and investment problems, including infrastructure development in the Asia-Pacific region.

“We have something we might suggest to our counterparts,” he said.

In China, the minister will hold a number of meetings including economics ministers of China, Indonesia and Malaysia.

“We hope to complete preparatory work on creating a free trade zone with Vietnam,” he said. “The same work is under way with New Zealand, and it has been started with India and other countries.”

The next step on the agenda is a multilateral free trade zone, the minister added.

“These talks are still incipient, though they have already lasted for several years,” he said. “Issues under discussion are still non-specific. Certainly we would like to move forward in this sphere,” he added."
