"MOSCOW, May 21 (RIA Novosti) – The detention of LifeNews journalists in Ukraine is an act of revenge for the truth they have shown, carried out by the Kiev authorities in an attempt to hide their own illegitimacy, Russian lawmaker Alexei Pushkov said.

These journalists have captured on video those helicopters with the UN markings, the ones that the Kiev authorities refuse to admit they have. After that, there was an order to detain them and it was done, said Alexei Pushkov, Head of the Duma Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Pushkov stressed that the LifeNews reporters have been charged with promoting terrorism. Allegedly, a portable anti-aircraft missile system was found in the trunk of their car,” he said.

“It is completely obvious that this was a deliberate action by the Ukrainian authorities. It’s quite impossible to trust in the statements of the Kiev authorities, he added.

By prohibiting Russian journalists from entering the country and regularly detaining those who are working on the scene, the Kiev regime not only tries to hide the truth about what is happening, but its original sin as well. And this original sin of the current regime in Kiev is the illegal seizure of power, its own illegitimacy, Pushkov explained.

LifeNews journalists Oleg Sidyakin and Marat Saichenko were detained April 18 by the Ukrainian National Guard near the city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region. Ukrainian authorities accused them of promoting terrorism in the east. Russian authorities have demanded their immediate release. The Russian Parliament is expected to make a statement Wednesday, once again demanding the immediate release of the journalists."
