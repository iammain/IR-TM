"MOSCOW, April 29. /ITAR-TASS/. When flying over Ukraine, air carriers should be ready to use navigation systems not based on GPS, Russian aviation watchdog’s (Rosaviatsia) representative told ITAR-TASS.

The agency has confirmed that it has sent notifications to the air carriers about interference with operation of onboard GPS receivers. “Rosaviatsia has notified the air carriers to be ready to use alternate navigation means when performing flights over Ukraine,” the agency’s representative said. 

Rosaviatsia’s representative stressed that “incidents that involve recurring interferences are considered by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) as threatening flight safety, which can lead to accidents caused by GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) failures.”

The aviation agency asked air carriers to notify it about all cases of navigation failure.

ITAR-TASS reported earlier that Rosaviatsia had registered the failure of GPS onboard navigation system in a civil airliner flying over Ukraine’s territory."
