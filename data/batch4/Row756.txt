"MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday blamed the United States and Ukraine for hampering the release of proposals on solving the Ukrainian crisis drafted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

Somebody in Washington and Kiev is against involvement of (East Ukrainian) regions in the dialogue, and this is why the roadmap drawn up by the OSCE chair is not disclosed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters following talks with his Ugandan counterpart Sam Kutesa.

This is another evidence that Kiev has yet to realize the need to talk to its own people, the Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying.

During a visit to Moscow on May 7, OSCE chairman-in-office Didier Burkhalter said the organization was mulling a four-item action plan offered for consideration to the four signatories to the Geneva agreements of April 17, so as to know which items were points of consent and which might need adjustment for their soonest implementation.

Lavrov said the crisis in Ukraine could only be settled through direct dialogue between the opposition in the eastern regions and Kiev authorities.

Without opponents of the regime to be admitted to direct talks over the crisis solution, nothing will happen, the minister said.

Lavrov noted that another four-party meeting would not be fruitful and no more international talks over the crisis have been planned at the moment.

No new meetings on Ukraine have been planned as of yet, but we would like the efforts to continue without slowing down and shortly materialize into a certain process, he said.

Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union reached a deal in Geneva to de-escalate Ukrainian tensions on April 17."
