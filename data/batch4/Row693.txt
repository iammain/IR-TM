"KIEV, May 29. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry plans to hold consultations with the European Union on possible signing of the remaining part of the association agreement before June 27, parliament-appointed Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia told a news conference on Thursday.

Initially, it was planned to sign the second part of the association agreement on June 27. “But Petro Poroshenko (who was elected Ukraine’s new president at the presidential polls on May 25) said he wanted this document to be signed earlier than that,” Deshchytsia said, adding that the consultations would focus on “how early this document could be signed”.

Earlier, Poroshenko came out with an initiative to sign the association agreement as soon as he was sworn into office."
