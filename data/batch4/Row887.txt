"MOSCOW, May 26 (RIA Novosti) – Moscow hopes that the newly elected authorities in Ukraine will show their commitment to a roadmap for crisis settlement proposed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.

“We really hope that the authorities in Ukraine, now after the election that was held, will confirm, and declare their commitment to the roadmap on the settlement, and that was proposed under the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. This road map was supported by … the international community,” Lavrov said.

A roadmap for the reconciliation process in Ukraine, recently unveiled by the OSCE, provides for concrete steps necessary to de-escalate the crisis in the country, including reducing violence, disarmament as well as facilitating national dialogue and elections.

It also stipulates a series of high-level roundtable discussions led by the OSCE aimed at bringing all sides of the Ukrainian conflict to the negotiating table."
