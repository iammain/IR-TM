"TOKYO, May 12 (RIA Novosti) – Japan has not given up on holding another round of negotiations with Russia on an official World War II peace treaty, Japanse Deputy Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki said Monday, according to the Kyodo news agency.

Japan and Russia never signed a permanent peace treaty following the end of hostilities in World War II because of a disagreement over four islands, which Russia calls the Southern Kurils and Japan calls the Northern Territories.

Although Japan coordinates its actions with the G7, the county wants to continue dialogue with Moscow and plans to hold consultations with Russia at the level of deputy foreign ministers, according to Saiki. The official, however, admitted the dates of the next round of talks have not yet been set.

The disputed islands — Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Habomai — were given to Soviet forces at the end of World War II and are still claimed by Japan.

It was earlier reported that Japan’s Foreign Minister was considering suspending consultations on a peace treaty in connection with situation in Ukraine, information that was not confirmed.

The decision to hold discussions on the peace treaty was made last April during the a rare visit of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The deputy foreign ministers of the two countries also discussed the possibility of a treaty during a meeting in August 2013. The first round of talks was held in late January."
