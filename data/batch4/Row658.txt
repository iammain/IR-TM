"TOKYO, May 30 (RIA Novosti) – Cooperation with Beijing does not contradict relations between Russia and Japan, which Moscow sees as a priority, the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament told the Nikkei newspaper in an interview Friday.

“The Russian-Japanese relations are extremely important to security guarantees of Russia and the Asia-Pacific region. They do not contradict the Russian-Chinese relations,” State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin said.

During President Vladimir Putin’s expected visit to Japan this fall, the sides could adopt a joint statement increasing the level of Russian-Japanese cooperation, Naryshkin added.

After Japan announced sanctions against Russia in mid-March amid the Ukrainian crisis, many Japanese politicians suggested that Moscow would toughen its stance against Japan.

In the interview, which comes ahead of Naryshkin’s June 2 visit to Japan, he said “dialogue among all the political forces” is the only way to ease tensions, including in Ukraine.

The Japanese government said in late April it will impose additional sanctions against Russia over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Tokyo said it will deny visas to 23 Russian nationals, including government officials, amid Moscow’s lack of visible action to reduce tensions in Ukraine.

Naryshkin’s visit does not contradict the sanctions, as his name is not included on the list, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. During his visit, the Duma speaker plans to attend an opening ceremony of a Russian cultural festival in Japan.

Earlier this month, Naryshkin called on Japan’s leadership not to succumb to blackmail by the US over the situation in Ukraine.

At the recent St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), President Putin expressed Russia’s willingness to negotiate with Japan when asked about his visit to Tokyo."
