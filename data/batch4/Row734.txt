"BERLIN, May 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Gas talks between Russia and Ukraine are yielding “certain consensus, Ukraine’s parliament-appointed Minister of Energy and Coal Industry Yuriy Prodan said on Friday.

“We understand that talks are needed. A compromise is beginning to show,” he said. “I would not state the exact price we want to agree upon. It should be within the market relations.”

“We hope the Brussels talks would be constructive. We are sure that the money we have transferred today would be credited to Gazprom’s account on Monday,” he noted."
