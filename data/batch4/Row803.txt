"WASHINGTON, May 12. /ITAR-TASS/. To express support for the forthcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, due to be held on May 25, is the principal aim of a European tour by Richard Stengel, US Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. From May 12 to 16, he will visit Ukraine, Latvia, and Belgium, the US Department of State announced on Sunday.

Under Secretary Stengel intends to use his trip to stress the need for greater regional engagement to support Ukraine's upcoming May 25 elections, push back against efforts to delegitimize them, and ensure that all Ukrainians are given the chance to decide their future for themselves, the State Department announcement said.

In Kiev Stengel will meet with Ukrainian government officials, members of civil society and the media. His visit to Kiev underscores US support for Ukraine's new interim government as it works to build an inclusive, transparent and accountable system of government that is responsive to the needs of all Ukrainians, the State Department pointed out."
