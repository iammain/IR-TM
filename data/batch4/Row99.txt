"MOSCOW, May 30 (RIA Novosti) – Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Slovenian counterpart Karl Erjavec met on Friday in Moscow to discuss the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.

“Ukraine is the hottest topic nowadays. We hope for a confidential, honest exchange of views on how to start the fulfilling the principles of the road map drafted by the OSCE's Swiss Presidency as soon as possible. First of all we are talking about the end of violence and the launch of inclusive all-Ukrainian dialogue, including on the issue of constitutional reform,” Lavrov said.

The parties will also exchange views on EU issues, he added.

The ongoing clashes between nationalists and federalists in Ukraine's east and south have led to hundreds of deaths in recent months. The violence followed the unconstitutional overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych in February, which led to the reunification of the Crimean peninsula with Russia."
