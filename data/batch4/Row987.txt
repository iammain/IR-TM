"KIEV, May 20 (RIA Novosti) – NATO member countries have promised to lend extensive support to the Kiev authorities, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said Tuesday following a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Working Group in Brussels.

“The participants of the meeting emphasized Ukraine’s crucial role in ensuring peace and safety in Europe and the world, pledged extensive support to the Ukrainian delegation and expressed readiness for further intensification of cooperation,” the ministry said in a statement.

The ministry added that NATO member countries were also planning on sending legal advisors to Ukraine to help reform defense and law enforcement agencies.

The Ukrainian army, which remains in critical condition, is also receiving material assistance from NATO members, including pumps, barbed wire and other equipment. A further batch of non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including helmets, body armors and night vision devices, was due to arrive soon.

In the wake of growing tensions in Ukraine, NATO took a series of measures which, as the alliance sees them, are aimed at ensuring the safety of its member states. In particular, it intensified its air patrols over the Baltic countries, deployed surveillance planes over Poland and Romania and dispatched warships to the Black Sea and Mediterranean.

The alliance also announced an increase in its personnel deployed to the crisis-hit country, expansion of training efforts and strengthening of its early-warning systems."
