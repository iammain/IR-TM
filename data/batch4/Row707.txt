"MOSCOW, May 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow urges Kiev to discuss humanitarian aid deliveries to Ukraine's eastern regions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

“On May 28 the Russian Foreign Ministry sent a note to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry informing the authorities in Kiev that citizens and organizations in eastern Ukraine, where casualties were reported as a result of military action, asked for urgent humanitarian aid, primarily medications,” the ministry says.

The Russian ministry confirmed that the country was ready to provide necessary aid to residents of the mentioned regions.

The Russian ministry named this statement cynical."
