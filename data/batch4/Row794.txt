"MOSCOW, April 30 /ITAR-TASS/. The next OSCE counter-terrorism conference may be held in Belgrade in the first half of 2015, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, April 30, after a just-concluded conference on the Role of the OSCE in combatting modern terrorism challenges held in Interlaken, Switzerland.

The Russian delegation to the forum was led by the president’s special representative for international cooperation in combating terrorism and transnational organised crime Alexander Zmeyevsky.

“Priority attention at the conference was paid to the Russian initiative to counter threats associated with the return of terrorists and militants from armed conflicts. The Russian representatives made a weighty contribution to the enhanced discussion of other issues on the agenda as well such as hostage-taking for ransom, legality in the fight against terrorism, and the protection of human rights,” the Foreign Ministry said.

“The Serbian OSCE Chairmanship is planning to hold the next annual counter-terrorism conference under the auspices of this organisation in Belgrade in the first half of next year,” the ministry said."
