"MOSCOW, June 02. /ITAR-TASS/. The situation in North Africa, the Middle East, and Sahara-Sahel zone will be in the focus of attention in Moscow on Monday at talks between the Foreign Ministers of Russia and Mauritania, Sergei Lavrov and Ahmed Ould Teguedi.

Russia's Foreign Ministry analysts regard the Mauritanian minister's visit as an important stride along the lines of development of the traditional relations of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. The visit is made on the eve of the 50th anniversary (July 12) of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and Mauritania, they point out.

Bilateral cooperation between the two countries is based on such principles as equality and mutual respect, solidarity and readiness to take into consideration the requirements and legitimate interests of each side in a partner-like manner.

Over the past five decades, specialists from Russia have been participating in geological prospecting in the territory of Mauritania, in survey for oil, the establishment of fish-processing enterprises, and oceanographic research, says the ministry's commentary.

Russian physicians have been successfully working for many years in hospitals and other medical institutions of Mauritania. More than 1,500 Mauritanians have received education at Soviet and Russian universities and institutes.

At present, Mauritania is going through an important phase of internal political life. Parliamentary and municipal elections were held at the end of 2013. The country's presidential polls are scheduled for June 21. We take a positive view of the fact that Mauritania consistently proceeds along the road of democratic transformations on the basis of interaction among all foremost political forces that are ready to constructively  participate in the political process, the ministry's analysts emphasize."
