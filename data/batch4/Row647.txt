"“We think the maintenance of the embargo against Cuba contrary to the will of a vast majority of UN member-states is absolutely unacceptable,” he said.

Sanctions against Cuba were introduced in 1960 in response to the expropriation of Americans’ properties. They were expanded later on up to a virtually full commercial and economic blockade of the island.

UN member-states have more than once spoken in favor of lifting the US blockade of Cuba. One of the documents towards that goal, a 2011 resolution on the importance of terminating the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the US on Cuba, received the support of 186 delegations at the UN.

Bruno Rodriguez said in October 2013 while taking the floor at the UN that the damage done to Cuba during half a century of sanctions had inflicted a damage of $ 1.126 trillion.

Since the start of Barack Obama’s presidency, Cuba’s blockade has only intensified."
