"MOSCOW, May 14 (RIA Novosti) – The US space agency has not been officially notified by Russia on changes to the countries’ cooperation in space, including the International Space Station (ISS) program, a NASA spokesperson has said.

Ongoing operations on the ISS continue on a normal basis with a planned return of crew tonight and expected launch of a new crew in the next few weeks, a NASA spokesperson said in a statement. We have not received any official notification from the government of Russia on any changes in our space cooperation at this point.

NASA said space cooperation has been a “hallmark of US-Russia relations,” including during the Cold War, and most notably, in the past 13 years of continuous human presence onboard the ISS.

Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin told journalists Tuesday Russia could stop delivering RD-180 and NK-33 rocket engines to Washington in response to US sanctions. He said Moscow has no plans to use the ISS after 2020.

US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said earlier the United States seeks to continue cooperation in space with Russia, including on the ISS program.

The US space agency announced in early April that amid tensions over Ukraine it would halt cooperation with Russia but will continue working together on the ISS and participate in joint meetings at international events in third countries."
