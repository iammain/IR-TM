"“The Russian president is extremely concerned over the developments in Ukraine and the way it is interpreted in the international community, some countries of the international community,” Peskov said.

He also noted that the Russian president was receiving in a round-the-clock regime information about the developments in the southeast of Ukraine. “Intelligence and related agencies report to him,” Peskov added.

Putin expressed deep condolences to families of people who died in Odessa. Kiev authorities bear responsibility for crime in Odessa and are factually it's accomplices, he added. Kremlin regrets approval of punitive operation is southeast of Ukraine, believes Catherine Ashton's words about Kiev authorities' monopoly on use of violence are unacceptable for human understanding. 

Those who describe 'Kiev's junta as legitimate' are also accomplices of crimes that took place in Odessa, Dmitry Peskov said. 

“Russia remains and will remain a country, seeking a dialogue and choosing only the dialogue path on the way towards the Ukrainian conflict settlement,” Peskov said. “We realise that without a dialogue with our European partners it is impossible to succeed.” He stressed, however, that “we cannot seek the dialogue alone” .

The Kremlin has called absurd the plans to hold presidential elections in Ukraine amid bloodshed, Dmitry Peskov said.

“It is obvious that under the current Constitution, in the conditions of combat actions, a punitive operation and mass killing it is at least absurd to speak about elections,” he stated.

“President Putin and Russia will continue to pursue the policy aimed at de-escalation. We will do everything possible and wherever possible in order to follow the de-escalation path step by step,” Peskov said."
