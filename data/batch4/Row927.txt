"“Would it be easier to hold a referendum on main issues at first, a referendum on constitution, enact it and then on a basis of a new constitution already to elect president, parliament and form a government after that?” Putin said to reporters.

Meanwhile, he noted that Kiev should establish relations with all regions in the country so that all Ukrainian citizens would feel as full-fledged citizens and ethnic minorities would have all rights, including the right to use their mother tongue.

Putin recalled that the effective Ukrainian Constitution did not permit to hold presidential elections if incumbent President Viktor Yanukovych was legitimately in office.

The Russian leader believes that a referendum, enactment of a new Constitution in the country before presidential elections would be much more logical and would bring a larger stability in the country.

“But current Ukrainian authorities have taken another decision with support of European countries and the United States,” Putin stated."
