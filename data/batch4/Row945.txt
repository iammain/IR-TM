"MOSCOW, June 2. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow has received a $786.4 million payment from Ukraine for its gas debt for February-April 2014, Russia’s Ministry of Energy told ITAR-TASS.

The ministry noted that two money transfers had been made as payment for gas supplies in February, March 2014.

In February and March Ukraine’s Naftogaz took 1.64 billion cubic meters and 1.8 billion cubic meters of gas, respectively, at the price of $268.5 for 1,000 cubic meters.

Russian energy giant Gazprom has earlier insisted on gas repayment of $2 billion before the end of the previous week for gas supplies which negotiating parties had found as undisputable.

On Friday, May 30, Ukraine said it had transferred the payment for part of its gas debt to Russia.

On Monday, talks will continue in Belgium’s capital, Brussels, on Naftogaz’s gas debt, scheme for its repayment, gas price and possibilities for Naftogaz to get back to the previous payment scheme without advance payment."
