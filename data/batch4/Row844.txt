"MOSCOW, April, 28 (RIA Novosoti) – An assassination attempt on Kharkiv mayor Gennady Kernes is further proof that it is impossible to hold elections in Ukraine at the moment, presidential candidate Oleh Tsarev told RIA Novosti Monday.

“I think that the fact that politicians are being shot here is abnormal, it once again proves that at the moment it is impossible to hold elections until consensus, peace and order are reached,” Tsarev said in a phone conversation, adding that even though Kernes is his political rival the shooting had shocked him.

According to Tsarev, Kernes’ time in the mayor’s office was not trouble-free.

“Apart from political issues he had many problems with his business and a lot of property disputes,” said Tsarev.

He believes that Kernes’ main political mistake was going against the will of Kharkiv’s citizens and supporting Kiev’s interim government.

The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was injured in an assassination attempt earlier Monday. He received a bullet wound to his back and was undergoing surgery in a local hospital Monday afternoon. Police have launched an investigation into the attack.

The incident came a day after 14 people, including two police officers, were injured in a clash between ultranationalists and federalization supporters in the city.

The Ukrainian parliament has called for early presidential elections on May 25 following the unconstitutional ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych in February amid violent street protests. At least two dozen candidates have announced their intention to run in the race."
