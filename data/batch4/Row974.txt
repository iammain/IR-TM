"MOSCOW, April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, believes that a UN peacekeeping operation will be unrealistic in Ukraine.

“A United Nations peacekeeping operation is absolutely unrealistic because Ukraine is a very big country, and there is no frontline there,” the Russian diplomat told the Russia 24 TV news channel on April 22.

Churkin believes that the OSCE presence in Ukraine will be sufficient and that the most important thing is that the authorities in Kiev realize that the Geneva document should be implemented, the right-wing forces should be disarmed and a constitutional reform should be carried out.

“Then, the situation will defuse in its due course and no peacekeeping operation will be necessary,” Churkin stressed."
