"MOSCOW, May 27 (RIA Novosti) – The next round of talks between Iran and six world powers will be held in Vienna on June 16-20, a spokesman for EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton said Tuesday.

The High Representative held very long and useful discussions with Foreign Minister Zarif in order to inform the negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme. They explored different possibilities as part of an ongoing process. The next formal round of E3/EU+3 talks with Iran will be from 16-20 June in Vienna,” Michael Mann said.

“In the meantime, the High Representative and Minister are recommending that an experts’ meeting should take place soon. Other political discussions will continue as and when needed, he said.

In November 2013, Iran and the P5+1 group – United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom, and France, plus Germany – agreed in Geneva on the temporary limiting of Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for a partial halt of US and EU sanctions on the Middle Eastern country. A complete agreement guaranteeing the lack of a military component to Iran’s nuclear program is scheduled to be finalized by July 20.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last week talks over Tehran’s nuclear program had reached an “important and tough juncture,” but an agreement was still possible by a July deadline."
