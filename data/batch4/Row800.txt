"MOSCOW, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – Two people were injured Monday during a shootout near an airfield in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, local media reported.

“Shots were fired from the side of a village near the airfield,” Dmytro Tymchuk, coordinator of the Information Resistance group, wrote on his Facebook page.

During the shootout, a member of Ukraine’s Security Service and an Interior Ministry official were reportedly injured.

RIA Novosti had not yet received official confirmation of the events.

Eastern Ukraine became a major hotspot earlier this month after the Kiev regime launched an “anti-terrorist” operation against pro-federalization protesters in the region.

Federalization supporters in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Gorlovka, Slaviansk and Kramatorsk have refused to recognize the legitimacy of the coup-imposed Ukrainian government. In response, Ukraine’s interim authorities launched the special operation to crack down on the protests. Moscow has denounced Kiev’s actions."
