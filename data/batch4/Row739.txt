"“GPS was down last night (from April 29 to April 30),” said one of the pilots of a Moscow to Tel Aviv flight.

The Aeroflot press service has made no comments.

The first GPS failure reported to the Federal Agency for Air Transportation occurred on April 24 aboard an A321 aircraft en route from Istanbul to Moscow some 60 miles before Dnepropetrovsk. The GPS signal reappeared after crossing the Russian border.

The Agency cautioned pilots that while flying over Ukraine they should use navigation instruments that are not based on the GPS technology. It asked airlines to record all GPS failures and report them in order to work out further steps."
