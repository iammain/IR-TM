"MOSCOW, May 16 (RIA Novosti) – Some 30 million people could turn out to protest against the US government in Washington on Friday, as Operation American Spring demands the resignation of US President Barack Obama.

The event, scheduled to begin Friday, calls on the participants to stay within the law of the First Amendment, come unarmed and bring plenty of water.

“All militia Commanders will take charge of their groups and establish communications and ensure good order and discipline,” the rules of engagement for the event say.

According to event organizers, the mission of the Operation American Spring is to restore “Constitutional government, rule of law, freedom, liberty ‘of the people, by the people, for the people’ from despotic and tyrannical federal leadership,” according to movement’s website.

The website says that “American veterans and patriots are energized to end the tyranny, lawlessness, and shredding of the US Constitution,” calling to replace the “corrupt and criminal leadership.”

Phase One of the OAS operations includes fielding millions of patriots who will join in “peaceful, non-violent, physically unarmed” gatherings. Phase Two would see a long-term protest in Washington that will last “as long as it takes to see Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi, and Attorney General Holder removed from office.”

Phase Three would see “those with the principles of a West, Cruz, Dr. Ben Carson, Lee, DeMint, Paul, Gov Walker, Sessions, Gowdy, Jordan, should comprise a tribunal and assume positions of authority to convene investigations, recommend appropriate charges against politicians and government employees to the new U.S. Attorney General appointed by the new President.”"
