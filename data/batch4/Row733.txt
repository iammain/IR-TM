"YELABUGA, April 25. /ITAR-TASS/. External circumstances must prompt Russia to change over to transactions in rubles in foreign trade in key commodity, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov told journalists on Friday.

“We are now actively working with our exporters so that they look at such a possibility, and if they take a relevant decision, begin negotiations with contractors to introduce into their contracts relevant currency provisions. It is necessary to get prepared to trade in key commodity in rubles,” he said.

According to Shuvalov, the Russian government looked at this possibility already ten years ago. “This subject came to the fore when it was decided to establish an international financial centre in Moscow,” he noted.

“The external circumstances that are taking place now must prompt us to take corresponding steps as soon as possible,” He said, adding however that it should be done with no haste. “We should not push companies towards this, they should get prepared along with their banks, the Moscow International Stock Exchange,” he noted.

“We should not be guided by emotions. Business is business,” he added."
