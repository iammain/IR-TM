Federation Council approves legal acts on easing procedure to get Russian citizenship

April 16, Russia’s upper house of parliament has approved several amendments to the law on Russian citizenship that simplify citizenship procedure for Russian-speaking compatriots. The document envisages to simplify procedure and cut deadlines to consider applications for Russian citizenship from Russian-speaking compatriots, “if these people or their ascendants live permanently or lived earlier in Russia or on a territory belonging to the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union, within Russian state borders, under the condition of their resettlement for permanent place of residence in Russia and abandonment of foreign citizenship.”

The key provision of the law endorsed by the upper house is introduction of an institute of recognition of foreign citizens or stateless people as Russian speakers. Meanwhile, according to the document, a person will be recognized as a Russian speaker as a result of questioning by a committee which the Russian migration watchdog is forming."
