"MOSCOW, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. A Moscow court sanctioned an arrest in absentia of Ukrainian businessman Gennady Balashov, who reportedly called for killing Russian nationals during anti-government protests in Ukraine’s capital of Kiev in March, a spokesman for the Russian Investigative Committee said on Thursday.

“The Basmanny Court of Moscow satisfied a motion from the Russian Investigative Committee to sanction an arrest in absentia of Gennady Balashov, who is on the international wanted list,” Vladimir Markin said.

Markin said that Balashov was charged with instigation of hatred, feud and murder.

Investigators claim that during an anti-government rally on Kiev’s Independence Square on March 10, Balashov was “making public appeals aimed at inciting hatred and feud in regard to Russian nationals on the territory of Ukraine and was provoking protesters to murder them (Russians).”"
