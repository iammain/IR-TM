"MOSCOW, May 27. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s possible withdrawal from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) would hit Kiev rather than the Commonwealth, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Nebenzya told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.

“It won’t hit the Commonwealth, it will hit Ukraine, since Ukraine will be negatively impacted,” he said. “Ukraine is a signatory to numerous agreements (within the Commonwealth of Independent States( in the economic and humanitarian spheres, which are beneficial for the country.”

Earlier on Tuesday, Ukraine’s parliament-appointed Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia told journalists that draft documents on Ukraine’s withdrawal from the CIS had been submitted to the Verkhovna Rada. “Draft resolutions to this effect are at the Verkhovna Rada,” he said."
