"KIEV, May 27. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine has no plans to impose a visa regime with Russia, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yevgen Perebeynis told a Ukrainian TV on Tuesday.

“The visa issue is outside the agenda,” he said. “At the moment, such a step (imposing a visa regime with Russia) would hit our citizens much more than Russians."
