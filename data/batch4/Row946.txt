"MOSCOW, April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. A senior Russian diplomat has expressed regret over the condition of the basic rights and freedoms in Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s commissioner for human rights, democracy and rule of law, Konstantin Dolgov, believes that basic human rights have been sacrificed to information warfare.

In a Twitter post Dolgov voiced surprise the West keeps turning a blind eye on the detentions of mass media workers in Ukraine.

“The detentions of journalists that the Ukrainian authorities and radicals do not like is a violation of the freedom of speech and of the mass media. Where are the human rights activists with their reaction?” Dolgov asked. “The fundamental human rights have been sacrificed to information warfare."
