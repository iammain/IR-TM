"He said the number of those willing to take part in the voting went up by evening. He also noted that the boundaries of the election district coincided with the boundaries of the consular district, and this fact should be taken into account when speaking about the turnout. “It means that among those eligible to vote in Moscow are Ukrainian who live in such Russian regions as Belgorod and Bryansk region, which are located closer to Ukraine than to Moscow,” he said. “It’s hard to expect that all of them would take part in the voting, although we have invited them all.”

He thanked the Moscow police for efforts to ensure law and order on the voting day. “There have been no incidents, no actions here,” he noted.

Meanwhile, some of those who took part in the voting told ITAR-TASS they had some claims regarding the organization of the election process. They said that voting was possible only for those registered with the consular department upon presentation of a foreign passport. Therefore, they said, several people who had no necessary documents had been allowed to cast their votes.

Commenting on these claims, Girzhov said his election commission was acting in strict compliance with the Ukrainian law. “Ukrainian citizens who are not living permanently on the territory of a consular district should have filed an application for taking part in the voting in advance,” he said. “Many acted this ways. It is impossible to put a person on the voter list on the voting day.”"
