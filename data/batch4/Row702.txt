"“Ukraine has asked us to help diversify gas supplies, we have done Ukraine a favor, and we are currently preparing such a line. We consider it normal and useful,” he said.

“As regards the supplies themselves, this is another operation. Our task is to supply. Who will pay — this is another issue,” Lajcak added. “It is important for us that this commercial operation conforms with international rules.”

“I would like to stress that in our negotiations with Ukraine with participation of the European Commission, we emphasized the non-acceptance of violating the agreements that already existed,” he said.

“The Slovak government’s position does not violate the agreements with Gazprom and with the Russian government that is why we have no claims,” he said after talks with Slovak counterpart Miroslav Lajcak on Monday."
