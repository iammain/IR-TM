"MOSCOW, May 27 (RIA Novosti) – Russian activists from the Law Against Fascism association are planning to hold public events to provide their European partners with documentary evidence of human rights violations in Ukraine, Alexander Brod, coordinator of the association and Director of the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights told journalists Tuesday.

“We intend to conduct in the near future a series of public events inviting our colleagues – European human right activists, lawyers, politicians. Among other things we will show them documents bearing evidence of crimes committed by the Ukrainian government against their own people, of inaction of law enforcement officials,” Presidential Council for Human Rights Member Alexander Brod said.

Law Against Fascism is an association of non-governmental organizations to coordinate aid for Ukrainian citizens affected by the punitive actions of the Kiev authorities.

The association began its work on Tuesday in Moscow. More offices are expected to open in other regions near the border between the two countries.

Ukraine has been gripped by a string of ongoing violent clashes since November last year. Anti-government protests that resulted in the overthrow of President Yanukovych in February gave way to pro-federalization rallies, mostly in the country’s southeastern regions.

To crack down on the protesters, the new Ukrainian government launched a large-scale military operation in the regions.

Numerous casualties were reported, with a tragedy on May 2 in Odessa being the deadliest episode of violence when 48 people died in a fire at the city’s Trade Unions House following clashes between pro-federalization activists and fans of the Odessa and Kharkiv football teams.

On Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry called for an impartial investigation of human rights violations in Ukraine with the participation of the European Council, including the tragic events in Odessa."
