"MOSCOW, May 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has voiced concern over the continuing punitive operation in the south-east of Ukraine.

In a telephone conversation with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday, Putin said he hoped that the new Ukrainian leadership would stop military actions against civilians and start a direct dialogue with the regions.

Erdogan has also approved of Putin’s decisions to improve the position of Crimean Tatars. Erdogan “praised the Russian president’s decision to improve the state of Crimean Tatars and ensure their full participation in Crimea’s public and political life”, the Kremlin says.

Putin and Erdogan “agreed to maintain contacts on these issues”, it says."
