"MOSCOW, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has called for an immediate stop to the use of force by Kiev against the people in Ukraine.

In a telephone conversation with his French counterpart Laurent Fabius on Thursday, May 8, Lavrov also called for “fostering a national dialogue aimed at carrying out fair constitutional reform that would take into account the interests of all political forces and regions” in Ukraine.

“Otherwise, the presidential elections in Ukraine scheduled for May 25 will be senseless,” Lavrov said."
