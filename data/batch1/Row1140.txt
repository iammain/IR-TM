"BRUSSELS, May 26. /ITAR-TASS/. The date for the mooted Russia-NATO Council session on the developments in Ukraine’s south-eastern regions has not been fixed yet, a spokesman for the Western military alliance said on Monday.

The spokesman said negotiations on the issue are still in progress but there was still no agreement on the date for the session.

An emergency meeting of the NATO-Russia Council over a sharp deterioration of the situation in Ukraine’s south-east was initiated by Moscow last Monday.

Sergei Koshelev, the director of the International Military Cooperation Department at the Russian Defense Ministry, said earlier that Russia proposed holding the session before May 25, but NATO disagreed with the proposed date."
