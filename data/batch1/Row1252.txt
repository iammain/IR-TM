"ST. PETERSBURG, May 15. /ITAR-TASS/. A response to Ukraine’s use of UN symbols on helicopter gunships which Ukrainian military forces use in a punitive operation near the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk is a matter of the international organization’s secretariat, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov told reporters on Thursday.

“This (use of UN symbols) is inadmissible according to UN rules. Ukraine really delivers military hardware for UN peacekeeping operations in different regions of the world. But when it is not needed any longer, this military hardware is being brought back to its deployment places and all UN symbols will be removed from it,” he added."
