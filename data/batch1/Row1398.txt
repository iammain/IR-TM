"WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- One person has been killed and two others missing after a hot air balloon hit a power line and caught fire over the U.S. state of Virginia, police said on Saturday.

Authorities have found one body, and were continuing to search for the two missing after the Friday evening accident about 50 kilometers north of Richmond, Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said at a press conference.

We are still looking for the other two and the wreckage, she said.

The balloon, with a pilot and two passengers aboard, was one of three hot air balloons that took off from the Meadow Event Park in Caroline County, Virginia, on the eve of the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival Friday, local police said. It hit a power line, caught fire and then shot up into the sky before exploding and crashing.

A regional investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board was looking into the cause of the accident, according to the agency."
