"KIEV, May 28 (RIA Novosti) – Security forces controlled by Kiev say members of the self-defense forces in eastern Ukraine have attempted to discuss holding talks with the leadership of the regime's ongoing special military operation.

“The leadership of the Anti-Terrorist Operation has announced conditions for talks: laying down arms and surrendering. In these conditions, we will guarantee to them security and possible talks,” said Vladyslav Seleznyov, the official speaker of the operation.

He said it was needless to speak of ending the operation.

The self-defense forces have not yet confirmed the reported plans.

Pro-federalization protests have swept across Ukraine’s southeastern regions in response to the regime change in Kiev in February and the ouster of the country’s legitimate president Viktor Yanukovych.

In mid-April, Ukraine’s interim government launched a special operation to crack down on federalists, but failed to gain control over the self-proclaimed independent republics. Moscow described the operation as a punitive act.

About 50 members of self-defense forces and 50 civilians were killed in Monday’s clashes with pro-Kiev troops in Donetsk."
