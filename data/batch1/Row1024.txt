"If it is confirmed, it would mean that Kiev authorities violated agreements concluded with international organization, the press service of the Department for Peacekeeping Operations of the United Nations stated.

UN agencies are in contact with the Ukrainian authorities on this issue,  the spokesperson added.

The Department for Peacekeeping Operations stressed that the states provide aircrafts and other equipment to peacekeeping missions should get rid of all UN logos and markings as soon as it (equipment) returns home and no longer used for official purposes of the world organization.

Moreover, each letter of the order, to sign with the troop-contributing countries, clearly states that their governments can use the UN symbols only for operations that were requested by the United Nations, the Department for Peacekeeping Operations noted.

Earlier media reported that at least three helicopters colored white with UN identification marks were used in military operation near Kramatorsk.

There were three combat Mi-24 and one Mi-8 helicopters. Ukrainian helicopters were involved in several UN peacekeeping missions particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
