"Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia reaches $3.5 bn

Ukraine’s gas debt to Russia has hit $3.5 billion, according to preliminary data released on Wednesday, a Gazprom official told reporters.


  The new data includes Ukraine’s Naftogaz order as of April 30 and
  those volumes that were already supplied this month, Sergey
  Kupriyanov stated.



  Ukraine's energy minister, Yury Prodan, responded, stating that
  Ukraine does now agree with Russia’s gas debt estimate of US$3.5
  billion, UNN news agency reported. Prodan added that Ukraine
  continues to insist on the price of $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters
  for Russian gas.



  Last week, Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said that
  Ukraine’s growing gas debt may lead to the failure of the
  country’s transit obligations and the reduction of gas
  supplies to southeastern Europe.



  The debt may force a situation where not enough gas will be
  pumped into Ukrainian underground storage facilities, which may
  create the risk of non-performance by Ukraine of its transit
  obligations and of an undersupply of gas to southeastern Europe,
  the minister stated.



  In December, Russia provided Ukraine with a $3 billion loan,
  which was part of a larger $15 billion aid package agreed the
  same month. Moscow also offered a 33 percent gas price discount
  that would have saved more than $7.5 billion.



  In April, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said that Russia
  cannot continue to prop up Ukraine’s faltering economy.


“The Russian Federation doesn’t recognize the legitimacy of
  the authorities in Kiev, but it keeps providing economic support
  and subsidizing the economy of Ukraine with hundreds of millions
  and billions of dollars. This situation can’t last
  indefinitely,” Putin said.



  Ukraine has not paid for Russian gas since the beginning of 2013,
  and with all discounts withdrawn it is now charged $485 per 1,000
  cubic meters of gas."
