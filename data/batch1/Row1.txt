"MOSCOW, May 07. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia urged the relevant bodies of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to condemn systematic violations of journalists’ rights in Ukraine.

“We are convinced that the relevant international bodies, including UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatovic and the UN Human Rights Council should condemn systematic violations of journalists’ rights in Ukraine,” the ministry said.

It noted that “gross violations of journalists’ rights” were continuing in Ukraine. On May 6, a three-member crew of the Russian TV Center channel was deported from Ukraine under the formal pretext of “lacking necessary documents”. The journalists had been officially seconded and provided with proper documents to cover the pre-election situation and the presidential elections in Ukraine.

“Judging from the fact that the crew was awaited at the airport by Ukrainian mass media and that its deportation was aired on the local TSN channel on the same day, this was Kiev’s deliberate action aimed at restricting journalists’ activities,” the ministry said."
