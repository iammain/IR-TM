"“How could they put military guests in a bus and send them without an appropriate co-ordination to an area controlled by self-defense forces, without giving them any documents confirming their status? It was either a provocation or, I beg your pardon, a folly,” the Russian ambassador said.

He said that the Russian side “is trying to secure the release of observers”. “One of them has already been released for health reasons,” the diplomat recalled.

Churkin also said that “the Kiev regime, encouraged by the Western ‘friends,’ is persistently pushing the country towards a catastrophe”.

According to the diplomat, it is clear from the statements and actions of the Kiev authorities that they are not going to fulfill the agreements, reached at a meeting in Geneva on April 17. He recalled that just several days after the meeting “there was the resumption of the so-called ‘antiterrorist,’ and in essence a punitive operation.” “Some 15,000 troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, planes, units of the Right Sector were sent to the southeast of Ukraine,” the RF ambassador to the UN said."
