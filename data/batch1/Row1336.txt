"MOSCOW, May 6 (RIA Novosti) - The next US ambassador to Moscow should not expect his mission to be easy, a Russian deputy foreign minister told RIA Novosti Tuesday.

“We had gone through a very difficult period when Michael McFaul was the ambassador. Under present circumstances, the future US ambassador will have a very difficult job, no matter who is appointed to the post. And I’m sure that our US colleagues are perfectly aware of it,” Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview with RIA Novosti.

Former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul resigned from his post in February, having taken the job in January 2012. His future replacement is not yet known, although there have been a lot of speculations in the media in recent weeks.

Ryabkov said he had no information about when the new ambassador will be appointed or who it will be, adding that he was “not ready to speculate on the issue or make any theoretical suggestions.”"
