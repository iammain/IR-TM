"MOSCOW, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. A draft appeal to the parliaments of the world and international parliamentary organizations in connection with a looming humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine has been submitted to Russia's State Duma.

The document, authored by State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin and the leaders of all four factions, urges “the parliamentarians of the world to do everything possible to stop the mass violence and the impending humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine”.

“State Duma deputies are enraged by the fact that the Kiev authorities are encouraging the escalation of the civil war and the brutal killing of peaceful citizens by rampaging national radicals,” the document said.

“The exact number and names of those who were burnt alive in the new Khatyn - Odessa - are still unknown” and range from “several dozen to several hundred people, which signifies that the authorities are unwilling to tell the truth and put those responsible on trial”, the document said."
