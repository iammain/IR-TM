"BERLIN, May 28 /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s government-appointed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has confirmed that Ukraine is ready to sue Russia at the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce Arbitration Institute over its dispute over gas prices.

“We are not going to pay 500 USD per thousand cubic meters of gas,” Yatsenyuk told an energy security conference in Stockholm.

“No one has the right to use gas as a political weapon. At the same time, Kiev admits there is an outstanding debt,” Yatsenyuk said.

Gazprom’s Chief Alexei Miller said that Ukraine’s outstanding debt for Russia might reach 5.2 billion dollars by June 7."
