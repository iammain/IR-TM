"MOSCOW, May 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia’s top diplomat said the crises in Syria and Ukraine were artificially created for changing the regimes.

“The crises in Syria, Libya, Iraq, as well as in Ukraine, are aimed at changing the regimes. It is necessary to search for ways to overcome them,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at talks with Slovenian counterpart Karl Erjavec on Friday.
