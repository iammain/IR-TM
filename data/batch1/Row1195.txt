"?US to withdraw Russia from GSP trade benefits program

President Barack Obama has notified Congress of his plan to drop Russia from the US Generalized system of Preferences (GSP) trade benefits program, the White House said. The program allows duty-free imports for certain goods.


  Obama sent the notification to Congress on Wednesday. The White
  House stated that Russia is “sufficiently advanced
  economically” and no longer needs special treatment.


“Russia's actions regarding Ukraine, while not directly
  related to the President's decision regarding Russia's
  eligibility for GSP benefits, make it particularly appropriate to
  take this step now,” Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the
  White House National Security Council, stated in the email to
  Reuters.



  The move means that Russian goods will be subject to import
  customs duties in the US.



  The US GSP is a program which is targeted at promoting economic
  growth in the developing world “by providing preferential
  duty-free entry for up to 5,000 products when imported from one
  of 123 designated beneficiary countries and territories,”
  according to the Office of the US Trade Representative.



  The US has already imposed sanctions on dozens of Russian
  businessmen and politicians, as well as the country’s fourteenth
  largest lending institution, Bank Rossiya. Russia responded
  initially by imposing its own sanctions on high-ranking US
  officials.



  Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said in late April that Russia
  faces “unprecedented” economic challenges, but that sanctions
  will make Russia stronger.



  Among the businessmen affected by the sanctions is head of
  Russia’s state-owned Rosneft, Igor Sechin. Sechin linked the
  measure to Rosneft’s activity and considered it as “an
  appreciation” of the company’s “efficiency”."
