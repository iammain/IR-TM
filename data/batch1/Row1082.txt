"MOSCOW, May 18 /ITAR-TASS/. The leadership of Russian LifeNews television channel has appealed to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with an official statement, asking him to help free its reporters detained near Kramatorsk, southeastern Ukraine.

“We bring to your attention the fact that a LifeNews TV crew of reporter Oleg Sidyakin and cameraman Marat Saichenko went missing on May 18, while on an editorial mission to cover developments in the southeast of Ukraine,” the letter of LifeNews Director General Ashot Gabrelyanov, said.

“Journalists of LifeNews TV channel were in Ukraine legally, and were working in accordance with international rules without violating law,” Gebrelyanov said in the letter sent to the Foreign Ministry. “We ask you to help free journalists of a Russian television channel,” the letter went on.

Earlier on Sunday, reports came that Ukraine law enforcers had detained Oleg Sidyakin and Marat Saichenko near Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine. Attempts to get in touch with them have failed since then. The reporters last contacted the editorial staff at 13:50 Moscow time on May 18."
