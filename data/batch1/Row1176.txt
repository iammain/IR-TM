"MOSCOW, May 8 (RIA Novosti) – Paris hopes there won’t be a third round of EU sanctions against Moscow, the French ambassador to Russia told RIA Novosti.

“The European Union believes – and the French Foreign Minister said as much on May 5 – that the snap presidential election [in Ukraine] on May 25 will be a turning point on the path towards a peaceful crisis settlement,” Jean-Maurice Ripert said in an interview with RIA Novosti.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius warned earlier that European leaders would be forced to go ahead with a third wave of anti-Russia sanctions should the May 25 vote fail, because a presidential election is a tested way to settle crises.

Ripert underscored the economic nature of the proposed new sanctions and said France would have to fall in line with the rest of the EU in implementing them. “They are being prepared beforehand, but it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be imposed. France hopes this won’t be needed.”

He added, however, that tighter economic sanctions against Russia would eventually affect the EU and France. “Sanctions will hurt the Russian economy, but they will also hamper EU-Russian relations,” the diplomat noted.

Ripert described the Ukrainian crisis as a “test of our relationship.”

“We cannot close our eyes to the recent events. But France isn’t going to give up on its friendship and cooperation with Russia,” he said.

On Wednesday, the European Union failed to agree on fresh sanctions against Russia, a source close to the EU leadership told RIA Novosti. EU envoys will meet again prior to the meeting of the Council of Europe’s foreign ministers on May 12.

Moscow has repeatedly warned that talking in the language of sanctions is “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warned its Western partners about the “boomerang effect” that sanctions would have."
