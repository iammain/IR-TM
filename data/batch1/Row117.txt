"MOSCOW, May 8 (RIA Novosti) – Russia has received a roadmap on a possible resolution to the Ukrainian crisis drafted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Kremlin said Thursday.

“Russia has received the OSCE’s ‘roadmap’ through diplomatic channels. Time will be needed for its quick study,” presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Peskov earlier said Moscow was also going to analyze the situation as a whole.

The news came on the heels of a Wednesday meeting between President Putin and OSCE Chairman Didier Burkhalter in Moscow where they discussed the situation in Ukraine.

French Ambassador to Russia Jean-Maurice Ripert earlier told RIA Novosti the OSCE had been debating a package of measures to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine.

He said the organization regarded the upcoming presidential election on May 25 and the subsequent creation of a lawful government in Ukraine as one of the key steps to promote peace in the country.

An early presidential election was scheduled in Ukraine on May 25 after President Victor Yanukovych was ousted late February following mass rallies."
