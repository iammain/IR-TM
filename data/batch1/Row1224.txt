"MOSCOW, May 5 (RIA Novosti) – Germany has warned that an upcoming referendum on autonomy in Ukraine's Donetsk may exacerbate the crisis in the country, Reuters has reported.

A German government spokesman said Monday that the referendum, planned for May 11 in Donetsk, would violate the country’s constitution.

In early April, protesters in the city of Donetsk seized local government buildings and proclaimed the creation of the People’s Republic of Donetsk. They scheduled a referendum for the self-determination of the region for May 11.

The coup-imposed Ukrainian authorities backed by Western countries responded by launching a military crackdown on the protesters using military force.

Pro-federalization rallies have been spreading across southeastern Ukraine since a regime change took place in Kiev in February. Ukraine’s parliament also scheduled early presidential elections for May 25.

Moscow has repeatedly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of upcoming presidential elections, saying they violate international laws and urging Kiev to take into consideration the demands of all citizens of Ukraine."
