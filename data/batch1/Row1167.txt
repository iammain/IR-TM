"Saving business: Canada chooses not to sanction Russia’s Rosneft, Rostec bosses

Canada has chosen not to impose sanctions against two of Russia’s top officials already targeted by the US – Rosneft’s Sechin and Rostec’s Chemezov.  Reports say Ottawa doesn’t want politics to be hurting one of the country’s biggest business projects.

Our goal is to sanction Russia, it is not to go out of our
  way to sanction or penalize Canadian companies, as Reuters
  quotes a Canadian government source familiar with Ottawa's
  sanctions strategy.


We will continue to apply pressure to Russia, we will
  continue to impose sanctions along with our allies, but we will
  also look out for Canada's broader interests, it added.



  Sergei Chemezov is head of state-owned industrial and defense
  conglomerate, Rostec. The company has an aircraft assembly joint
  venture lined up with Bombardier Inc - a deal vital for the
  Canadian plane and train maker. Last year the two companies
  signed a $3.4 billion deal to sell 100 short - haul aircraft in
  Russia. Another Bombardier interest in Russia includes a
  long-standing joint venture in its rail business.



  Igor Sechin is CEO of oil giant, Rosneft, which owns some 30
  percent of an Exxon Mobil Corp oil field in the western province
  of Alberta.



  A fresh comment contradicts Canada’s earlier statement by
  Minister Stephen Harper, who said in March that the country’s
  foreign policy wouldn’t depend on commercial interest.


It's egregious. I think this is not consistent with what the
  government's rhetoric is on getting tough with the Russians and
  getting tough with Putin, said Paul Dewar, foreign affairs
  spokesman from the New Democrats – Canada’s official opposition.



  Canada has maintained a hard stance on Russia, as it has already
  sanctioned 80 Russian and Ukrainian officials, less than 60
  targeted by the US."
