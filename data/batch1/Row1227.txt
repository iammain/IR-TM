"Self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic elects head, passes constitution

The self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic (LNR) elected its head and passed its own constitution on Sunday. This comes after the region held a referendum on May 11 and proclaimed itself independent from Kiev.


  LNR’s state council – which acts as a temporary legislative body
  – has chosen Valery Bolotov as the head of the republic. The
  council also elected its speaker, Aleksey Karyakin, and Prime
  Minister - Vasily Nikitin.



  Bolotov was born in Russia’s southern port city of Taganrog in
  1974. He has two university degrees. He also worked his way up
  from a manager to the director at a meat factory. Before being
  elected as the head of the self-proclaimed republic, he was
  serving as the “people’s governor” of Lugansk region.



  Deputies of the council who where elected earlier on Sunday on
  also adopted a temporary constitution of the Lugansk People’s
  Republic.



  The newly elected prime minister already identified what his
  first steps in the office will be. “As the prime minister I
  will form a new government. I will announce the specific
  candidates later. The members of the new cabinet will be
  determined in the second part of the day [tomorrow],”
  Itar-Tass quoted Nikitin as saying.
  
  Last weekend, Ukraine’s Donetsk and Lugansk regions held
  referendums in which the majority of voters supported self-rule.



  In Lugansk region 96.2 percent of voters supported the region’s
  self-rule, according to final figures announced by the local
  election commission. Almost 90 percent of voters in Donetsk
  region have endorsed political independence from Kiev."
