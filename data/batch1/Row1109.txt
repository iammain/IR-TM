"SHANGHAI, May 20 (RIA Novosti) – Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that there were absolutely no disagreements between China and Russia and stressed the two countries shared a great number of joint plans and a determination to implement them.

“We have no disagreements. In contrast there are major plans, which we are fully determined to implement,” Putin said at a meeting with former President of the People's Republic of China Jiang Zemin.

The Russian leader thanked Zemin for his extensive contribution to the development of Russian-Chinese bilateral relations and stressed that the current Chinese government keeps moving in the same direction.

“Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping did a lot to develop our relations,” Putin said.

“I want to thank you once again for giving momentum to Russian-Chinese relations when you were in office,” the Russian president added.

Putin arrived in China on Tuesday for high-level talks with top Chinese officials, meeting earlier in the day with Chinese President Xi Jinping. A large package of documents, including bilateral, intergovernmental, inter-departmental and corporate agreements are expected to be signed during Putin’s two-day visit."
