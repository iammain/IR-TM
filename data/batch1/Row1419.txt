"According to Maya Kocijancic, the foreign ministers of 28 European Union countries discussed the issue at their meeting in Brussels on Monday.

Meanwhile, European carriers made practically no flights to Crimea even before its accession to Russia. Only Turkish Airways, AtlasJet and Uzbekistan operated regular flights to the then Ukrainian region.

After the referendum on March 16, 2014, the Ukrainian aviation authorities closed the airports of Simferopol and Sevastopol for flights, insisting that Crimea was Ukraine’s territory. In April, Eurocontrol, the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation, banned flights to the airports of Simferopol and Sevastopol, as well as transit flights via the Crimean airspace."
