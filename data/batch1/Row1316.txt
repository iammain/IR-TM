"“Russia is keen to see Ukraine remain solvent, in particular for it to be able to repay gas debt,” he is quoted as saying, adding “We want Ukraine to pay back debts it does not deny — more than $2.2 billion for Q1 supplies made at the old, low price.”

Discounts were possible if Kiev demonstrated it was ready to pay, which, the paper says quoting the minister, would be Russia’s “contribution to Ukraine’s economic recovery”.

Before April 1, the price per 1,000 cubic meters had been $268, the price Kiev wanted Gazprom to charge now. “Since they do not pay even at this price, we have no guarantee we’ll receive money for future supplies,” the minister is quoted as saying."
