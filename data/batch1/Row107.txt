"MOSCOW, May 14. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia’s demand for summer foreign educational programs has dropped against the previous year over sanctions the European Union had imposed on Russia, spokesperson of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry Irina Tyurina told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday.

In her words, the demand in different tourist companies has fallen in a range between 20% and 50% on 2013.

“The beginning of this week was marked with another expansion of the EU ‘black list’ for Russia that includes already more than 60 people banned from entering the European Union,” she recalled. “Foreign diplomatic offices stated repeatedly that ordinary Russians going on a foreign trip should not be afraid of sanctions, because all countries are interested in attracting tourist flows from Russia and no one is going to put up obstacles in issuing visas to our tourists. However, many Russians take the policy of sanctions seriously and the segment of educational tourism turned out to be most vulnerable in this respect,” Tyurina noted.

Largest losses were sustained by foreign language courses in the United States, Great Britain, tour operators also included Canada and Australia in this list, she added. “Foreign language camps in Malta and Cyprus are feeling better in the general situation,” the spokesperson noted."
