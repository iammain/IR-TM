"SHANGHAI, May 20 (RIA Novosti) – Russia and China urge all sides, involved in resolving Iran nuclear issue, to continue searching for compromises, it is said in a joint statement on the new stage of full partnership and strategic cooperation signed during the bilateral talks between the two countries.

The document underlined that Moscow and Beijing “call on all sides, participating in the process, to continue to look for compromises and refrain from actions that could have negative impact on the course of the talks on sweeping agreement.”

Iran and the so-called P5+1 group - Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany – held fourth round of talks on Teheran’s nuclear program in Vienna last Friday but failed to reach progress in settling the long-disputed issue.

Earlier Sunday Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi announced that the next round of talks will be held in Vienna from 16 to 20 of June. He admitted that the parties have some unresolved issues but Iran believes the draft of the final agreement on the nuclear program could be completed soon.

In November 2013, Iran and the P5+1 group agreed in Geneva on the temporary limiting of Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for a partial halt of US and EU sanctions against Iran. A complete agreement guaranteeing the lack of a military component to Iran’s nuclear program is scheduled to be developed by July 20."
