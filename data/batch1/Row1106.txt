"PYONGYANG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) had urged the U.S. troops to stop their alleged hostile acts against the country near a village on the inter-Korean border, the official KCNA news agency reported Tuesday.

A top security officer of the Korean People's Army (KPA) in Panmunjom on Monday accused the U.S. troops of conducting surveillance and espionage against Pyongyang by setting up a huge steel watchtower in the village separating the two Koreas, the KCNA said.

We solemnly demand the U.S. forces side stop at once all the hostile acts seriously rattling the nerves of the other side, the unnamed officer was quoted as saying.

The combatants of the KPA in Panmunjom will never pardon any slightest provocation by the U.S. forces side in the sensitive area of Panmunjom, he said.

The officer also said the U.S. troops spied on the DPRK far beyond Panmunjom by using various kinds of surveillance and eavesdropping equipment in the tower.

According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, a U.S. military official in Seoul said the United States had notified the DPRK that it was building the tower, but declined to say how far the tower could monitor the country, adding that Pyongyang had its own tower near the area for apparent monitoring of South Korean and U.S. troops.

About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, including Panmunjom, after the 1950-1953 Korean War was halted by an armistice agreement."
