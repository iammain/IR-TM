"MOSCOW, May 13 (RIA Novosti) – Kiev’s reluctance to engage with the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk hampers the de-escalation process in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.

The statement came on the heels of today’s meeting in Moscow between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin and the head of the EU delegation to Russia, Vygaudas Usackas.

“The Russian side emphasized that the refusal of the current authority in Kiev to engage in a sincere dialogue with the regions’ representatives, especially from the country’s south and east, were serious stumbling blocks on the path towards de-escalation and national reconciliation in Ukraine,” the ministry said in a statement.

The statement added that Moscow expected its “partners from the EU and US” to pressure the Kiev regime into negotiating on the future of the country’s government and guarantee self-determination rights for the southeastern regions ahead of the Ukrainian presidential election on May 25.

The nationwide dialog, it said, should be framed with regard to the April 17 Geneva Communique on Ukraine as well as the recent “roadmap” that sought to broker the Ukrainian settlement under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Earlier, OSCE Chairman and Swiss President Didier Burkhalter brought a roadmap to Moscow, which included concrete steps with on reducing violence, disarmament as well as facilitating national dialogue and elections, steps necessary to de-escalate the crisis in the country.

Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the roadmap when meeting Burkhalter last Wednesday."
