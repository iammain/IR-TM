"BELFAST, May 28 (RIA Novosti), Mark Hirst – Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political party affiliated with the Irish Republican Army (IRA), will directly brief US President Obama’s senior advisers during a visit to Washington later this week.

Shortly before leaving Ireland, Adams, who is a member of the Irish parliament, again called on the British Government to honor its commitments to the peace process.

Notwithstanding challenges facing the Government, the Taoiseach must ensure that the British Government faces up to its responsibilities as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement,” he said.

Outstanding elements like a Bill Of Rights, Acht na Gaeilge [Irish language Act] and other issues such as dealing with the past, parades and flags, must be delivered upon, Adams said.

The Obama administration and Irish America have a role in encouraging meaningful processes to implement these necessary and long overdue rights for citizens in North,” he added.

Earlier this month, Adams was arrested by police detectives investigating the killing of alleged British Army informant Jean Mcconvile in Belfast in 1972. The Sinn Fein leader was held and questioned for four days before being released without charge. Adams has consistently denied having any role in Mcconville’s execution or having been a member of the IRA.

Professor Dominic Bryan of Queens University in Belfast told RIA Novosti he believed that much of the speculation over the crisis in the peace process was artificially generated by the respective parties in order to gain a political advantage.

It is important that Adams maintains a position as a key player in Ireland and appearing in Washington looks good having been taken in an out of a Police Station in Northern Ireland, Bryan told RIA Novosti.

Sinn Fein would much rather see the Unionists walk away from a government in the north than do so themselves Bryan added."
