"The position of the Party of Regions with regard to the Russian language has not been changed since 2003 we insist on its official status, he said. The matter is in the fact that Russian-speaking citizens account for at least 40% of the population in Ukraine. Therefore, their interests must be protected in three main spheres education, media and business communication, Kolesnikov notes.

As was reported earlier, the regionals' leader in the parliament, Oleksandr Yefremov, said on Thursday that deputies from the party would not participate in voting in the parliament until their demands and demands of protesters in the country's eastern regions were met.
