"KIEV, May 07. /ITAR-TASS/. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) evaluation mission will arrive in Ukraine in late June or early July, IMF Resident Representative in Ukraine Jerome Vacher said on Wednesday, May 7.

Vacher said technical assistance would be provided to the government of Ukraine within the next two months, including on matters related to public expenditures.

The aid package for Ukraine includes enough funds to cover its debt for gas supplies, the official said, adding that the package was structured in such a way as to allow Ukraine to pay its gas debts and fulfill its main obligations.

Vacher said that aid was based on the gas price of $385 per 1,000 cubic metres and noted that the price should be discussed by Naftogaz of Ukraine and Russia’s Gazprom.

He admitted that it was hard to determine the market price of gas but different price levels could be found."
