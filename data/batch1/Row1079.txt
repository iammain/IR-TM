"MOSCOW, May 29 (RIA Novosti) – The events unfolding in Ukraine are following a Libyan scenario, according to Andrei Klishas, a senior Federation Council member.

“The lack of clear and definite deadlines for constitutional reform in Ukraine means that the West wants the country to follow a Libyan scenario,” Klishas said Thursday, adding that Libya had been destroyed as a result of such a process.

The Russian senator pointed out that the deadline for constitutional reform is constantly being put off, and eventually it will lead to the “aggravation of the economic crisis in Ukraine.”

Ukraine underwent a Western-backed regime change resembling a military coup in February. The country’s parliament ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, changed the constitution and scheduled an early presidential election for May 25.

A presidential election was held last Sunday amid a deep political crisis and large-scale military operation launched by Kiev’s authorities in mid-April to crack down on pro-federalization supporters in the southeast of the country. Confectionary tycoon Petro Poroshenko led the race with over 50 percent of the vote."
