"MOSCOW, April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow hopes that the US will stop its far-fetched insinuations about Russia for the sake of cooperation in resolving the crisis in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

Groundless accusations against Russia are the US's familiar mode of action in the Ukrainian crisis, the foreign ministry noted.

“It is surprising that the US refuses to recognize the free will of the Crimean residents at the March 16 referendum, and repeatedly raises he issue of observing the rights and commercial interests of US citizens living on the peninsula, but has not cited a single fact or just a name,” the ministry added.

Russia is open for dialogue, but it rejects indiscriminate and unfounded accusations that have as the sole purpose the distortion of the situation in Crimea, the Russian Foreign Ministry stressed."
