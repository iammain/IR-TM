"MOSCOW, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. Irresponsible policy is the main reason behind the situation in Ukraine, which has already claimed the lives of people, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.

Russia intends to strictly adhere to the agreements and contribute to the crisis settlement, the president confirmed.

“The example of our neighbor - brotherly Ukraine - illustrates that an irresponsible policy brings misfortune and losses,” the president said at an informal meeting in Moscow with the heads of Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

Hundreds of thousands of people are deprived of a possibility to live a peaceful and happy life, the president added. “Of course, we are not indifferent to the developments in Ukraine,” he said.

Referring to his talks on Wednesday with Didier Burkhalter, the Swiss president and current chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Putin said that Russia “intended to act within the framework of these agreements”.

“Concrete moves were outlined towards making more active OSCE efforts to deescalate tension in Ukraine, first of all through a direct dialogue between the present Kiev authorities and representatives of Ukraine’s south-eastern regions,” Putin added."
