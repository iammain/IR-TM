"“The discussion of the crisis socio-political situation continued. Merkel requested to provide assistance in the release of military observers from a number of European counties, including Germany, who were detained in the southeast of Ukraine,” the press service said.

“Both sides noted the importance of the maximum use of the mediator potential of the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe (OSCE) throughout Ukraine,” the press service said.

The leaders of Russia and Germany arranged to hold another telephone conversation shortly.

Putin and Merkel permanently keep in touch in connection with the Ukrainian crisis: in March and in April the settlement of this situation was the subject of six telephone conversations.

On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin held a telephone conversation with British Prime Minister David Cameron. The leaders agreed that the political confrontation in Ukraine could be overcome exclusively by peaceful means."
