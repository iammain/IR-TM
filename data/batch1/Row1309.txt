"MOSCOW, May 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Kiev’s refusal to cooperate with Russia over humanitarian aid deliveries to the east of Ukraine is absolutely cynical and unacceptable, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Democracy and the Supremacy of Law Konstantin Dolgov said.

“Unfortunately, in its note, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry ‘lays the blame on’ the situation in the Republic of Crimea. There are speculations about alleged violations of human rights and the humanitarian catastrophe on the peninsula. They have nothing in common with the real situation,” Dolgov told ITAR-TASS on Friday.

“Kiev forgets that it cut off fresh water supplies to Crimea if it has the good of Crimeans’ needs at heart. This is a cynical position,” he said.

“The note implies nothing about Ukraine’s need to create conditions for humanitarian aid deliveries to the east. The population needs it as a result of the punitive operation. We are ready to provide it,” Dolgov said.

Moscow hopes that the authorities in Kiev “will re-assess the situation and realize that the people’s interests prevail. They will feel the humane spirit of our proposal and agree to cooperate”, he said.

“The facts that Ukrainian law enforcers are trying to block towns in eastern Ukraine and attack them are absolutely outrageous. Peaceful civilians are at risk,” Dolgov said.

On May 29, Ukrainian armed forces tried to prevent the evacuation of children from Sloviansk. “This is the violation of all principles of international humanitarian aid,” Dolgov said."
