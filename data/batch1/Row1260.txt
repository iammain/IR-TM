"MOSCOW, May 26. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow expects objective and comprehensive reports about the situation in Donetsk from the OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) observers, and also expects the Kiev authorities to stop the punitive operation against its own people in the south-east of the country, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday.

“In connection with reports about armed clashes on the outskirts of Donetsk and casualties” Russia has “urgently appealed to the OSCE leadership and the special monitoring mission of that organization deployed in Ukraine, requesting detailed information on the developments there and on measures to deescalate tension in accordance with provisions of the mission’s mandate and the ‘road map’ of the Swiss OSCE presidency,” the ministry said.

Actions by Ukraine's law enforcers and closure of Donetsk International Airport are hindering the dispatch of bodies of the dead Italian journalist and his Russian interpreter, the foreign ministry added."
