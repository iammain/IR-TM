"KIEV, May 15 /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s former Prime Minister and the leader of the Batkivshchina (Fatherland) party, Yulia Timoshenko, who is running for president in the snap presidential elections scheduled for May 25, has come out with an idea to ask the world about a third round of sanctions against Russia.

“We must once again ask the countries, which acted as guarantors of the integrity of our state, peace and tranquility, to apply to the European Union, to all players on the geopolitical space, who consider themselves as leaders, to promptly take a number of steps,” she said on Wednesday at a nationwide roundtable meeting of national unity. “Step one is to tell the world how guarantees will be observed, to tell definitely and clearly whether they would be implemented. Step two - we must finally ask for a third level of sanctions against Russia.”

Ukraine, in her words, should also apply to the participants in the Geneva talks held on April 17 in the format Ukraine-the European Union-the United States-Russia. “If the Geneva accords do not work, the world should work out another way. I think Ukraine can now initiate such appeals and we expect concrete and clear answers to these questions,” she said."
