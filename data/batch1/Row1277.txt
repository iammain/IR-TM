"BERLIN, May 04 /ITAR-TASS/. U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigations are consulting the incumbent authorities in Kiev at the instruction of the U.S. Administration, says the German weekly Bild am Sonnntag weekly quoting sources in Germany’s power-wielding organizations.

The objective the U.S. intelligence services have been given is to suppress the popular protests in the east of Ukraine and to build up a viable security structure for the regime.

The newspaper claims however that neither CIA nor FBI officers are involved in combat operations unfolding in the east, and their entire activity is confined to Kiev.

Also, U.S. spies supposedly assist the regime in fighting with organized crime.

Bild am Sonntag recalls that CIA chief John Brennan visited Kiev in mid-April. The chairman of Russia’s State Duma committee for international relation, Dr. Alexei Pushkov said then that the visit “exposed a close relationship between the incumbent government in Kiev and the U.S.”

Dr. Pushkov said with confidence that “the U.S. had supplanted the Ukrainian government and had installed a regime lucrative for itself."
