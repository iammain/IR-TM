"KIEV, May 29 (RIA Novosti) – Ukraine is planning to discuss the timeline for signing the economic portion of an EU association agreement with European representatives, Ukraine's interim Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia said Thursday.

“President-elect Poroshenko said that he wants to sign the agreement soon. We have to consult with the EU to learn how soon we can sign the document,” he said.

The signing of the remaining part of the agreement was initially planned for an EU summit on June 27, Deshchytsia added.

Poroshenko’s press office said Wednesday evening that the billionaire considered it essential not to delay the signing of the economic provisions of the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU. He said he wanted to sign the deal immediately after his inauguration as head of state.

Chocolate tycoon Petro Poroshenko took nearly 55 percent of the vote in Ukraine’s early presidential election last Sunday, according to the Central Election Commission. The inauguration ceremony for the new Ukrainian leader is expected to be held June 8-10.

Last November, then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych decided to suspend all preparations for the completion of the agreement with the European Union.

The move triggered pro EU-integration protests that later resulted in violent clashes and a regime change when the country’s parliament, backed by far-right movements, voted to strip Yanukovych of his powers.

On March 21, the EU and Kiev interim authorities singed the political provisions of the agreement."
