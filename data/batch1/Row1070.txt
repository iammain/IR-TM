"MOSCOW, May 15 (RIA Novosti) – A Twitter campaign targeting Michelle Obama is gaining steam as a reaction to the US first lady's own social media initiative to draw attention to the plight of Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by the Boko Haram terrorist group.

Michelle Obama has used the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag to promote awareness of the kidnappings through social media, but critics of US military intervention abroad have accused her of hypocrisy, drawing attention to the civilian casualties of US foreign wars.

The opponents of US government policy are now using the hashtags #BringBackOurDead and #BringBackOurDrones to coordinate the quickly spreading response.

The anti-drone campaign, part of the backlash, raises awareness about the civilian victims of US drone attacks overseas, as users “wonder what'd happen if all the family members of civilian drone strike casualties” joined the campaign.

Another grievance among online critics of US policy is the “belittling” of the kidnapping cause through popularization and backyard activism.

The debate continues to unravel against the backdrop of a US decision to deploy drones to Nigeria to help search for the kidnapped girls."
