"KIEV, May 27 (RIA Novosti) – Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Vitaliy Yarema said Tuesday that there was no need to declare a state of emergency in Eastern Ukraine where military operations are currently under way.

Today, there is no ground to declare the state of emergency. I think that the turning point of the anti-terrorist operation has come, Yarema said.

A large-scale military operation was launched by the new Kiev authorities weeks ago to crack down on protesters refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the government.

Violent clashes between the military and pro-federalization activists have plagued Ukraine's eastern and southern regions, killing dozens, including civilians and journalists. The Luhansk and Donetsk regions — which held referendums on self-determination earlier this month and proclaimed themselves independent republics — have been hit the hardest.

Billionaire businessman Petro Poroshenko has been declared the provisional victor in Sunday’s presidential election in Ukraine, with over 95 percent of ballots counted. He will take over the post from President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled the country during a series of violent protests which led to his unconstitutional overthrow on February 22.

After claiming victory in the election, Poroshenko said the special operation in eastern Ukraine should continue and become more effective.

Commenting on the remarks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said intensifying the military operations in southeastern Ukraine would not facilitate a warm reception for Poroshenko."
