"However, no practical decisions are expected to be adopted at the meeting. The ambassadors will discuss the latest developments in Ukraine and further sanctions against Russia, including trade and economic ones.

The EEAS official denied assertions that the EU foreign ministers may meet on May 2 to discuss the situation in Ukraine, as some European mass media reported earlier this week.

He said no dramatic changes had occurred in the situation that would require an urgent meeting of the EU foreign ministers, especially since they are to gather for a scheduled meeting in Brussels on May 12 anyway.

Brussels made this move claiming that Russia had failed to take practical steps to implement the Geneva Statement of April 17 on the de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine and in view of the growing tensions in that country. However, the EU has not been able to present any proof that Russia is exerting practical influence on the protesters in the South-East of Ukraine."
