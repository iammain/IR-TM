"MOSCOW, May 16 (RIA Novosti) – Washington is concerned that Iran and six world powers have failed to achieve progress during negotiations on Tehran’s nuclear program in Vienna, Reuters reported Friday citing a senior US official.

“Talks have been slow and difficult, said the official on condition of anonymity. “Significant gaps remain. Iran still has some hard decisions to make. We’re concerned that progress is not being made and that time is short.

Iran and six world powers – Russia, China, France, the US, the EU plus Germany – began a fourth round of nuclear talks on a broader agreement at UN in Vienna on Wednesday. Friday is the last day of the May 13-16 meeting.

In November 2013, Iran and the so-called P5+1 group agreed in Geneva on the temporary limiting of Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for a partial halt of US and EU sanctions against Iran. A complete agreement guaranteeing the lack of a military component to Iran’s nuclear program is scheduled to be developed by July 20."
