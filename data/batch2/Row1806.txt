"KIEV, May 13. /ITAR-TASS/. Kiev doubts the necessity in another international meeting devoted to the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis until the previous Geneva accords are fulfilled. Spokesperson for Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yevgen Perebyinis made this statement at a briefing on Tuesday.

Earlier, the parliament-appointed Prime Minister of Ukraine Arseniy Yatsenyuk once again supported the four-party format of the international talks on settling the crisis in the country. He made the relevant statement at a briefing in Borispol airport after talks with German Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who arrived on a visit in the Ukrainian capital. “We support the format of talks involving Ukraine, EU, USA and Russia,” Yatsenyuk said.

May 12, Russia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov stated that it would not be possible to convene a new meeting on Ukraine without the participation of those opposing the Kiev regime.

“It would not be effective to gather in a four-party format again; we suggest on this stage, when all key players agree that at the Geneva meeting on April 17 the main principles of the peaceful settlement in Ukraine were negotiated, instead of reviewing, to develop these principles into practical steps, which should be taken by the confronting parties — the Kiev authorities and those who disagree with their policy, in particular, the south-eastern regions of Ukraine,” the Russian minister said."
