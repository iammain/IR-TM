"SANTIAGO, April 30 /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it would be wrong to think that U.S. allies could not cooperate with Moscow.

“It’s wrong to think that if someone is an ally of the United States he cannot be a partner of Russia and vice versa,” he said after talks with his Chilean colleague Heraldo Munoz on Wednesday, April 30.

He said Washington wanted to work with countries that are members of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and are partners of Russia.

Replying to a question from a Chilean reporter whether his Latin American tour was undertaken in response to the U.S. moves against Russia over the crisis in Ukraine, Lavrov said the very way the question was put was wrong. “There is nothing I can say to this. It [question] is based on the wrong understanding of the situation and Chile’s policy in world affairs,” he said.

Lavrov said relations between Moscow and Santiago were valuable all by themselves and this had been borne out by his meeting with Chilean President Michele Bachelet."
