"MOSCOW, May 03. /ITAR-TASS/. The latest events in Ukraine prove that Russia’s position on Crimea was the only correct one, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday, May 3.

“We understand how justified and correct the actions taken by President Putin, Russia and the people of Crimea were,” he said. “If Putin had not assumed a firm position and the people of Crimea had not voted for reunification with Russia, the bloodshed similar to that in the South-East of Ukraine could be happening now in Crimea,” he said."
