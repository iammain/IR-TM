"BRUSSELS, May 21 (RIA Novosti) — The European Union is prepared to present information on the volumes of Russian gas delivered to the EU through Ukraine, President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso said in a letter addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In this regard, the European Union is prepared to provide actual data on the incoming gas flow from Ukraine. I count on both the Russian Federation and Ukraine to also commit in the short term to provide actual data on gas inflow and transit through Ukraine, Barroso wrote.

He also said the EC hoped that Russia and Ukraine would remain reliable partners in the deliveries and transit of gas to the EU, which is also very much in their own interest.

He called for a constructive approach from the Russian Federation to solve the issues at hand.

The EU has earlier imposed sanctions on Russia due to escalating crisis in Ukraine, and threatened to cut purchases of gas from Russia, its major energy supplier.

In the two out of three planned stages of sanctions, the EU targeted 61 people, including high-ranking Russian officials and two Crimean companies. The third stage, not yet reached, would be broad economic sanctions against entire sectors of the Russian economy.

Members of the European Parliament have urged limiting cooperation with Russian energy companies, including halting construction of the South Stream project, which is planned to deliver Russian natural gas to Europe via a route bypassing Ukraine. The resolution came as a voluntary recommendation.

Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said earlier the upcoming May 25 presidential election in Ukraine will decide whether the EU foreign ministers would consider new sanctions against Russia."
