"MOSCOW, May 28 (RIA Novosti) – Russia has not received any official request from the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) for Russian help, Presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said Wednesday.

“I did not see it [the request], it was not on my table, but if he [Republic’s Head Denis Pushilin] sent it, then it would probably arrive,” Ushakov said.

On Tuesday, Donetsk People’s Governor Denis Pushilin released an online video message asking Russia to provide the besieged region with “any possible help,” following a spike in hostilities around its capital city Donetsk. He also announced the DPR was switching to Russian law.

On Monday, Donetsk became the focal point of the Ukraine authorities’ “anti-terror” operation involving strike helicopters and fighter jets. After a battle at the Donetsk airport, the self-defense forces were forced to retreat. National Guard units of the Kiev regime moved out towards the center of the city, but federalists blocked their path with vehicles.

About 50 members of self-defense forces and 50 civilians were killed in Monday’s clashes with pro-Kiev troops in Donetsk.

The self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics in eastern Ukraine held referendums on self-determination on May 11, with over 90 percent of voters supporting greater autonomy. The two republics signed a treaty on May 24 to establish the Union of People’s Republics."
