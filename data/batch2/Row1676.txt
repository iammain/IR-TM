"MOSCOW, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is to hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss the situation in southeastern Ukraine, where protesters have detained several OSCE military observers, Agence France-Presse reported.

According to a source cited by AFP, the crisis talks are scheduled for Monday at 1 p.m. GMT in Vienna, Austria.

People’s Mayor Vyacheslav Ponomarev said earlier today the monitors could be freed in exchange for the release of federalization supporters taken hostage by Kiev.

Last week, activists stopped a bus at a checkpoint carrying OSCE monitors who were accompanied by Ukrainian officers. The protesters detained 11 members of the military mission on suspicion of espionage, including eight Europeans and three Ukrainians."
