"KIEV, May 29 /ITAR-TASS/. Ukrainian President-elect Pyotr Poroshenko said the economic part of Ukraine’s Association Agreement with the European Union should be signed immediately after his inauguration.

Signing and implementing the agreement would provide the opportunity of launching anticorruption measures and a package of reforms in the nearest future, the presidential press service quoted him as saying.

He expressed the hope that the EU and its leaders who had consistently supported Ukrainian citizens' European choice and declared the readiness to finalize the signing of the association agreement after the Ukrainian presidential election would support this position, too."
