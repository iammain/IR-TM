"MOSCOW, May 29. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia calls on the West to influence Kiev to stop Ukraine’s descent into a national disaster, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday.

“We will repeat once again: the international community expects Kiev to immediately stop combat operations in the country’s east and withdraw troops,” the ministry said.

“It is impossible to achieve peace in Ukraine without that. We are again calling on our Western partners to use all their influence on Kiev in order to stop Ukraine’s descent into a national disaster,” it said.

“Regular shelling of cities and civilian facilities, including with the use of aviation and artillery, brings pain and suffering to civilians. Elderly people and underage children are among those hurt,” the statement said.

“We again demand that the Kiev authorities stop the fratricidal war and start a real national dialogãó with all the political forces and representatives of the country’s regions to search for ways for Ukraine to overcome the deepest crisis,” the statement said."
