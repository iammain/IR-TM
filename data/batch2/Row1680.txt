"KIEV, April 25 /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry called on Russia to dissociate itself from Ukrainian protesters who stage actions under Russian flags.

Russia “must condemn” protesters “who act under the Russian flag and force them to surrender arms and use only political means to express their views,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.

The ministry also urged Russian to “cut short military exercises and pull the Russian troops off the Ukrainian border.”

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that the operation in Ukraine’s eastern region was not aimed against Russia or Russian-speaking citizens. This operation is geared to protect civilians, the ministry claimed.

Earlier on Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that what Kiev’s current authorities were doing today was a punitive action and a crime against their own people. “The so-called Easter ceasefire was disrupted,” the foreign minister said. “The counter-terrorist operation has been resumed. What the Kiev authorities are doing today is just a punitive operation which already resulted in many victims. About 160 tanks, 250 armoured infantry vehicles and other hardware and aircraft are used to fight against own people. These are bloody crimes for which those who involved the army will be held responsible."
