“Let me explain: we have worked out and implemented measures that exclude the use of these [GPS] stations for military purposes. Now they are under our full control,” Rogozin wrote in his Twitter microblog.

The Russian vice-premier also said that Moscow had “initiated talks with the US on the deployment of our [GLONASS] stations on the US territory.”

The talks are expected to last until August 31, following which “new decisions will be taken,” Rogozin said."
