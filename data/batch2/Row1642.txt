"“Proceeding from the current situation in Ukraine, we do not rule out its possible decline,” he noted. “We do not rule out that several our export contracts may be affected over current situation in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Russian defense and industrial sector can make up completely for this damage within 18-24 months,” the chief of the military-technical cooperation service said.

Western sanctions against Russia over the current tensions in Ukraine may have a negative effect on the manufacturing of some weapons and military hardware, he added.

“Sanctions against Russia over Ukraine may affect the manufacturing of some planes, aircraft and naval technologies, as well as some airborne strike weapons,” he said.

The foreign policy situation is surely taken into account in forecasting the amounts of weapons Russia will be able to export in the near term, but this factor is not the decisive one, Aleksandr Fomin noted.

“Certainly, we do bear in mind the current foreign policy situation, but in estimating the annual amounts of military products to be exported we rely on such decisive factors as contractual liabilities, draft contracts and the expected results of research into requests from foreign customers,” Fomin said. “The forecast for the near term is stable."
