"ASTANA, May 28. /ITAR-TASS/. Anti-Russian sanctions will not affect the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union, Timur Suleimenov, Minister for Economic and Financial Policy of the Eurasian Economic Commission, told ITAR-TASS.

“Nothing has changed fundamentally. Sanctions against some companies or individuals in Russia do not diminish the appeal of the Russian market for our goods and services,” he said.

Possible challenges posed by sanctions opened certain opportunities for Kazakhstan, Suleimenov said, noting Russia’s increasing attention to cooperation with China. This increases the goods and energy transit potential of Kazakhstan as it borders both countries, he added.

Asked whether the free trade zone “from Lisbon to Vladivostok” remained topical in the current political environment, Suleimenov said it should “remain on the table”. Even in better times, the zone was considered a long-term initiative and “it will be just postponed now”.

Speaking of possible cooperation with Ukraine, the minister said the 2011 Commonwealth of Independent States free trade zone among former Soviet nations would continue implementing agreements that should remain “undisputable”, irrespective of who came to power in signatory nations."
