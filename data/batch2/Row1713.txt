"MOSCOW, June 02. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian energy giant Gazprom has delayed introduction of advance payment for gas supplies to Ukraine to June 9, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told reporters on Monday.

“Ukraine has paid the first tranche for gas supplies. Today, $786 million were transferred to Gazprom. We welcome that Ukraine had started gas debt repayment and delay introduction of advance payment to June 9. Introduction of advance payment scheme will depend on whether the country repays its full debt of $2,24 billion for gas supplied before April 9, some part of debt is reimbursed today, and on progress in payments for gas delivery in April and May. Payment for May gas supplies should be made before June 9,” he said.

Gazprom has earlier planned to introduce prepayment system from June 3. Before the deadline, Ukraine’s Naftogaz was to make a payment for future gas supplies in June."
