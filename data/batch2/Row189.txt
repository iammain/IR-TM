"“We have good large-scale joint ventures we have inherited from the past, moreover, we have good prospects for the future,” Putin said, opening the meeting, adding that Russia ranked second among Mongolia’s trade partners.

The Mongolian president, who spoke with Putin in Russian, agreed that the two countries had potential for further cooperation, including in the area of railway transport.

“Mongolia is located between China and Russia and is the shortest way for transit by rail and other transport means,” he said. “We should look at how to use these possibilities.”

Elbergdorj said that a three-party agreement on cooperation in the area of through transportation was being prepared, as was a similar bilateral agreement. Apart from that, Mongolia, he noted, was working on amendments to the 1949 agreement on the establishment of Ulan Bator Railways.

The Mongolian leader also proposed to abolish visa formalities between the two countries. “It’s high time to look at easy-term or visa-free trips for Mongolian citizens to neighbouring countries,” he said.

“Let me invite you to Ulan Bator in August, maybe, in its second half,” he said at a meeting with the Russian leader."
