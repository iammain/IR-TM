"SHANGHAI, May 20. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia and China have expressed concern over the lingering nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, the leaders of the two countries said in a joint statement adopted after talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Shanghai.

“The parties agree that there is no room for use-of-force scenarios in the region. All existing problems should be resolved at the negotiating table,” the document says. “The two sides have agreed to coordinate and cooperate closely in the interests of forming effective institutions of peace and security.”

Russia and China hope that all parties will join efforts to resume six-party nuclear disarmament talks and achieve a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula."
