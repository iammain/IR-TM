"According to Yuri Nedashkovsky, president of the Energoatom Company, Ukraine’s three major nuclear power plants continue delivering spent nuclear fuel to Russia for temporary storage in a normal regime.

“We have no problems at present, including in taking (spent fuel) out of the country,” Nedashkovsky told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday.

Energoatom operates the four existing nuclear power plants in Ukraine and 15 power units with aggregate electrical power of 13,835 GW."
