"KIEV, April 27. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s chocolate king and candidate for president, Petr Poroshenko, say Ukraine may no longer buy Russian gas after 2015.

“Ukraine has all the possibilities to produce its own gas, including shale gas,” he said at a meeting with residents of the town of Berezhany, Ternopol region, on Sunday. “I am confident that the year 2015 may be the last one when we buy gas from Russia.”

He also said that Ukraine would receive reverse gas from Europe this October. “We have an agreement on reverse gas supplies from Slovakia from October. The European Union must help supply Ukraine with reverse gas,” Poroshenko said."
