"MOSCOW, May 27 (RIA Novosti) – Moscow hopes that after last Sunday's presidential vote Kiev will ratify a memorandum guaranteeing the security of observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday.

“Ukrainian authorities need, especially now as Petro Poroshenko claims he will solve all the problems, to at least start ratifying the memorandum ensuring the security of OSCE observers in Ukraine,” Lavrov told journalists.

Although the OSCE approved the deployment of the mission to Ukraine more than two months ago, Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has so far failed to ratify the document ensuring the rights, immunity and privileges of the OSCE staff in the country, Lavrov said.

“That’s why when the OSCE mission members disappear, there is no legal basis to demand urgent measures to locate them and ensure their security,” Lavrov said.

The May 25 early presidential election in Ukraine came amid a large-scale military operation launched by the Kiev regime to crack down on protesters in the east refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the government.

Billionaire Poroshenko has taken 54.5 percent of the vote in Ukraine’s presidential election with 95 percent of ballots counted, the country’s Central Election Commission announced Tuesday."
