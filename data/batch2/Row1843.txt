"KIEV, May 15. /ITAR-TASS/. Kiev is unable to bring the protesters in the Donbass coal belt region under control and to stop bloodshed, a lawmaker of the Party of Regions faction at Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada Anna Gherman said on Thursday.

“I cannot see any real results of yesterday’s talks,” Gherman said, commenting on Wednesday’s national roundtable meeting on settlement of the Ukrainian crisis. “No draft law that might have reaffirmed the things said at yesterday's roundtable was submitted to parliament today. So it means the authorities are unable to handle the situation in Donbass and stop bloodshed,” she noted.

She said that “many Ukrainian soldiers are already dead”.

“Mothers are stopping me at the entrance to Verkhovna Rada and saying that their children are sent to war where they die,” Gherman said with emotion. “That’s why I don’t understand the authorities’ inaction, why the parliament is unable to rally 300 votes to pass the amendments to the Constitution which would pacify the east,” she added.

“We desperately need these amendments and the Party of Regions is ready to vote for them,” the MP said."
