"MOSCOW, May 27. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, did not ratify a memorandum between Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that ensures immunity of OSCE mission members, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday.

“Therefore, when OSCE mission employees get lost, there are no legal reasons to demand urgent measures to find them and ensure their security,” the minister noted."
