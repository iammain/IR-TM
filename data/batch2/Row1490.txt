"“Development of relations with Japan is a priority task for Russian diplomacy. This is extremely important for ensuring security of Russia and the whole Asia-Pacific region. Development of relations with Japan does not contradict strengthening of Russian ties with China,” the State Duma speaker noted.

Asked about prospects of resolving the problem of a peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo, Naryshkin noted that “Calm talks should be held about this.” “The Second World War results should be also taken into account,” the state Duma speaker noted.

As for situation in bilateral talks after the events in Ukraine, Naryshkin noted that Japan’s sanctions imposed on Russia due to the Russian position on these events “had probably resulted from a strong pressure from the US”. He also voiced strong concerns over development of the situation in Ukraine. “The crisis is deepening and we do not take current events easily,” Naryshkin added, noting that “Probably, the only way to alleviate tension is a dialogue between all political forces.”

During his official visit the State Duma speaker is expected to participate in an opening of a traditional festival of Russian culture in Japan and to meet with the leadership of Japanese parliament and other political and public figures."
