"SHANGHAI, May 20 (RIA Novosti) – Negotiations between Russia and China on energy matters have not been hampered by the adverse environment caused by Western pressure on Moscow, Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin said Tuesday.

“It does not depend on momentary issues, as the question itself is a strategic matter. I hope that momentary issues are not taken into account, it is a long-term contract,” Sechin told journalists after talks in Shanghai.

Beijing has been cementing its business ties with Moscow amid strained relations between Russia and the EU, which along with the US recently imposed sanctions against Russian officials and companies in response to the reunification of the formerly Ukrainian Republic of Crimea with Russia.

In an interview with the China Daily newspaper, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who visited Beijing last month, said Russia and China are seeking to create a “more democratic” multi-polar world, with the United Nations and international laws playing the central role in the new balance of power.

Moscow has repeatedly stated that the language of sanctions is “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warned its Western partners about the “boomerang effect” that sanctions would have."
