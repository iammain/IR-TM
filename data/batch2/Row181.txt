"NOVOCHERKASSK, May 05. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine is delaying the delivery of gas turbines for Russian defense enterprises while not refusing to supply them, Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov said on Monday, May 5.

The turbines are to be supplied by the Gas Turbine Research and Production Complex Zorya-Mashproekt located in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv.

“There are some delays, including in the delivery of gas turbines for our shipbuilding enterprises. But there have been no refusals. We have sent a letter to Ukraine asking them to confirm their obligations to deliver. There has been no reply so far. Nor have we received any refusal to deliver,” Manturov said.

He noted that Russia was busy finding substituting capacities for the production of components that are currently imported from other countries.

“We are preparing for the production of components that are made in other countries which can refuse to supply them and on which we are dependent now,” the minister said. “Should this happen, we will quickly replace them with Russian components within a period of six months to two and a half years. We have import-substitution schedules,” he added."
