"“The political crisis in Ukraine may influence gas supplies and our activity in Russia,” the group said in its quarterly report.

E.ON said it procured about 337 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of natural gas from producers in and outside Germany in the first quarter of 2014. About a third of this amount was purchased under long-term contracts, it said. The biggest providers were Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, and Norway.

The company said its core earnings fell by nearly a quarter to 309.7 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in the first three months of the year, blaming a mild winter in Europe and weak wholesale prices that have made its gas-fired power stations unprofitable."
