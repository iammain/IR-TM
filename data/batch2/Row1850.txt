Bassil said that during his visit to Moscow he had discussed possibilities for investment cooperation between the two countries. “Lebanon could be a kind of bridge between Russia and other countries of the region,” he stressed.

Earlier, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Bassil and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov “reiterated the importance of further expansion of mutually beneficial Russian-Lebanese cooperation in various areas, including the oil and gas sector, energy sphere, and closer business, cultural and religious ties."
