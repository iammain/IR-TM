"ST. PETERSBURG, May 20 (RIA Novosti) – The possible introduction of Western sanctions against Russia if the upcoming presidential election in Ukraine is disrupted is ungrounded, as Russia has no relation to the vote, a senior Russian official said Tuesday.

“What relation does Russia have towards holding the election in Ukraine? If sanctions are to be introduced, they should be against the Ukrainian authorities who are organizing this election,” Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Meshkov said.

Asked whether Russia could retaliate if economic sanctions against Moscow were introduced, the diplomat said: “Our way is the way without sanctions, but Russia has already taken appropriate measures.”

Since March, the US and EU have imposed targeted sanctions against Russian officials, freezing their assets and banning them from obtaining visas, as well as against 17 Russian companies. The leaders of the G7 group of nations have further threatened Russia with sanctions against key sectors of the country’s economy in the event of a further escalation in the Ukrainian crisis.

Moscow has repeatedly stated that the language of sanctions is inappropriate and counterproductive and warned its Western partners about the boomerang effect that sanctions would have.

Ukraine underwent a regime change in February when the country’s parliament, backed by far-right movements, voted to strip President Viktor Yanukovych of his powers, amended the constitution and scheduled early presidential elections for May 25. A total of 23 candidates were registered to take part in the poll, but several candidates later withdrew."
