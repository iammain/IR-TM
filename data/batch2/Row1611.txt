"The main task now is to transport people who are returning home from Moscow after a working day. “Trains coming from Moscow can use one of the tracks on the Aprelevka-Nara section, which ha re-opened to traffic only in one direction,” the source went on to say. He clarified that passengers travelling from Moscow to the suburbs would no longer have to change over to express buses at the Aprelevka railway station to go home.

However, passengers bound for Moscow still need to make a change at the Nara railway station and continue their way by bus.

A passenger train collided with a freight train between the stations of Bekasovo and Naro-Fominsk, located on the Kiev-bound railway some 50 kilometers (34 miles) from Moscow’s center at around half past noon Moscow time (8:30 GMT).

The Moscow Department of Transportation earlier reported that the accident had been caused by a distorted railway.

The Interior Ministry reported that there were about 400 people in the passenger train as the total number of tickets sold stood at 394.

The cause of the train accident near Moscow was the disconnection of container freight train which damaged passenger train, Russian Investigative Committee representative  Vladimir Markin said earlier."
