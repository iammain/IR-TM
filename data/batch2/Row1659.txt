"OSLO, May 13. /ITAR-TASS/. Norway’s Defense Minister Ine Marie Eriksen Soreide told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday that Norway would consider a possibility of resuming military cooperation with Russia late in May.

Ine Marie Eriksen Soreide added that Norway was not the only country to freeze military cooperation with Russia. “Most of our allies and partners did the same,” the minister emphasized.

Meanwhile, Norwegian coast guards, border guards and rescuers continue active cooperation with their Russian partners because those areas are more of civilian nature and are very important for the citizens of both countries.

The Norwegian Defense Ministry is closely watching the situation in Ukraine and Russia.

“So far we have not noticed anything which could be potentially regarded as an immediate threat to Norway. However, we’ll keep watching,” the Norwegian defense minister said.

Late in March, the Norwegian Defense Ministry announced it was freezing military cooperation with Russia."
