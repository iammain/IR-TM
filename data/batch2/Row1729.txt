"BRUSSELS/MOSCOW, May 29 (RIA Novosti) - Kiev's decision about repaying a part of its debt to Russia is expected after a three-party meeting in Berlin on Friday, a source close to the negotiations told RIA Novosti on Thursday.

There will be no official information [about Ukraine's decision] today. Possibly, [the announcement will be made] after a meeting on Friday, he said.

The second round of three-party talks between Russia, Ukraine and the European Union was held in Berlin on Monday. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow was ready to negotiate a new price for future gas supplies if Ukraine pays at least $2 billion by Friday.

Ukraine's gas debt to Russia currently stands at $4 billion, according to EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger. Kiev continues to reject the new price of $485 per thousand cubic meters of Russian gas.

Gazprom earlier announced a switch to a prepayment scheme, in full accordance with the 2009 energy contract between Russia and Ukraine. Following the decision, an advance bill was sent to Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz for June deliveries, with supplies to be suspended starting June 3 if the debt is not repaid."
