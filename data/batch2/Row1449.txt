"I can't care less, Shamanov told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday, I have served my Motherland, its armed forces and paratroopers.

On Monday, the Official Journal of the European Union expanded its sanctions list by adding 13 people and two Crimean companies (Chernomorskneftegaz and Feodosia). The sanctions against Russian companies and officials were effective from the date of publication.

The persons against whom the EU imposed sanctions are First Deputy Kremlin Chief of Staff Vyacheslav Volodin, airborne troops commander Vladimir Shamanov, State Duma lawmaker Vladimir Pligin, four representatives of Crimea’s regional leadership and six leaders of federalization supporters in eastern Ukraine.

In all, there are 61 persons on the EU's blacklist now. The EU barred their entry into the EU, while their assets - if such are found in European banks - will be frozen."
