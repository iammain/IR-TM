"MOSCOW, May 5 (RIA Novosti) – The European Commission is obliged to call on Kiev to comply with the agreement reached in Geneva last month on the de-escalation of the crisis in Ukraine and the preparation of a new constitution for the crisis-hit country, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Monday.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is to meet with the European Commission’s Committee of Ministers on Monday and Tuesday.

“The European Commission is obliged to call on the current de facto Kiev authorities to the unconditional fulfillment of the agreements reached in Geneva on April 17 of this year on the de-escalation of tensions and the preparation of a new constitution that would fully take into [account] the lawful aspirations and concerns of all of Ukraine’s regions,” the ministry said in a statement.

On April 17 in Geneva, top diplomats from Russia, the United States, Europe and Ukraine agreed a number of measures aimed at the de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine, including the disarmament of irregular militant groups and a dialogue on constitutional reforms.

Despite Kiev’s promises to lay down arms, attacks on pro-federalization protesters continued and Friday saw the bloodiest violence since the country’s regime change in February. The highest casualty toll was reported in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa, where 46 people died and over 200 were injured.

Moscow has described Kiev’s actions as a punitive operation that is destroying any remaining hope for the implementation of the Geneva accords, demanding the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the European Council give an objective assessment of events in Ukraine."
