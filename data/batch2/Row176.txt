Venezuela condemns coup in Ukraine

Venezuela had analyzed the course of events in Ukraine in connection with the coup and condemned actions of neo-Nazi groups against the country's civilian population, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said on Thursday after talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.

The Venezuelan minister expressed gratitude for Russia's support for third countries that face threats from the outside to overthrow their governments.
