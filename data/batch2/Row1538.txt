"MINSK, April 29 /ITAR-TASS/. There are no Russian instructors, special units or troops in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday.

“I must say that Russia is not to blame here,” he said. “We either hear that there are our special units there or that there are instructors.”

“I state responsibly: there are neither Russian instructors, nor special units, nor troops, no one there,” Putin said.

Dialogue inside the country

President Putin said he had called on the authorities in Kiev to establish dialogue inside the country instead of looking for the alleged culprits of Ukraine’s misfortunes in other countries.

“It’s important to treat equitably the rights of the people living in other territories of Ukraine - I mean the and southeast in the first place, because a compromise solution is to be found,” Putin said as he described the steps that he found necessary.

“This is what should be done, and it’s totally wrong to look for guilty ones elsewhere,” he said."
