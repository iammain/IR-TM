"MOSCOW, May 29 (RIA Novosti) - Serbia's Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic has thanked Moscow for helping the country with the aftermath of the devastating flood that hit Serbia earlier this month, Russia’s foreign ministry said Thursday.

“The Serbian minister extended his sincere gratitude to the leadership of the Russian Federation for the tremendous assistance that was rendered to cope with the catastrophic aftermath of the flood, including deliveries of humanitarian goods and rescue operations,” the Russian ministry said in a statement Thursday.

Ivica Dacic today met with Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov on the sidelines of the ongoing Non-Aligned Movement summit in Algeria. Foreign chiefs agreed to boost multilateral cooperation in various spheres.

In May, Serbia, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina, declared states of emergency and asked Russia and the European Commission for humanitarian assistance. Russian rescuers were on mission in the flood-hit region from May 16 to 26, evacuating about 3,000 people.

Three Russian emergency helicopters brought over 100 tons of humanitarian cargo, with additional 40 tons for Bosnia and Herzegovina."
