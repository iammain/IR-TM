"BERLIN, May 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s losses in Crimea are estimated at “hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars,” Ukraine’s parliament-appointed Minister of Energy and Coal Industry Yuri Prodan said on Friday, adding that this sum would be included into a possible suit Ukraine plans to file against Russia.

“We are preparing a suit. It will be part of a bigger suit Ukraine is making against Russia,” he said, adding that Ukraine’s ministry of justice was working on this suit.

Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday after the gas consultations in Berlin involving Russia, Ukraine and the European Commission that Russia’s gas utility Gazprom had much more grounds to seek arbitration of the gas dispute that Ukraine,

“We think Gazprom has more grounds to appeal to arbitration court that the Ukrainian side,” he told journalists. “It is a long procedure and we don’t think it is constructive. It would be right to try to reach an agreement off arbitration bodies."
