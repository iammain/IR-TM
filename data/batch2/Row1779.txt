"KIEV, May 27 (RIA Novosti) – Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Danylo Lubkivsky has said Kiev is considering withdrawing from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the UNIAN news agency reported Tuesday.

“This organization [CIS] turned out to be powerless, that is why we hold to our own position and approach, and I confirm the statement of the CNS Secretary [Ukrainian Secretary to the Committee on National Security Andriy Parubiy] that we are considering withdrawal from CIS,” Lubkivsky was quoted as saying.

The deputy foreign minister added that the CIS had failed to take a common stand on the Ukrainian crisis. Lubkivsky said that Kiev is prepared for a long process of leaving the organization as “apart from common assessment we have to take concrete steps, the subsequence of which is absolutely clear to us”.

Secretary to the Committee on National Security Andriy Parubiy earlier said that Ukraine is determined to withdraw from the CIS and has already started the necessary procedures. Representative of the organization, however, told RIA Novosti that no relevant documents had yet been received from Kiev."
