"BELGRADE, May 05 /ITAR-TASS/. Russia is grateful to Serbia for opposing anti-Russian sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and other countries, Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy head of the Just Russia faction in the State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament), said on Monday, May 5, while on a visit in Serbia.

At the talks with Serbian MPs, the Russian delegation led by State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin thanked them for “not giving in to pressure and not joining the sanctions” as well as for support during the vote on anti-Russian resolutions in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the United Nations.

“It’s not a secret that the Americans were exerting pressure to prevent Naryshkin from coming [to Serbia]. That on one hand they are seeking to join the European Union and on the other hand were not afraid of receiving our delegation testifies to their [Serbs’] courage,” Yemelyanov said.

Earlier in the day, Naryshkin said he had met with Serbian parliament Speaker Maja Gojkovic to “discuss in detail the causes and evolution of the deep crisis in Ukraine”.

In Belgrade, Naryshkin laid flowers to the war memorial to Soviet soldiers who died while liberating the Serbian capital in 1944, to the monument to the heroes of World War I and to the tomb of Mikhail Rodzyanko, the speaker of the 3rd and 4th State Dumas in the early 20th century."
