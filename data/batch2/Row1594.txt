"“I think the viewpoints of people who took part in well-organized democratic referendums, and the fact was shown to the whole world, should be respected, and the Kiev authorities should immediately begin political dialogue with the regions that have declared their sovereignty and independence,” he said.

“I think the Organization for Security and Cooperation Europe (OSCE) might play a role in this (dialogue),” Ryabkov said. “As for the EU, it would be highly desirable for it to work with more responsibility rather than through the policy of sanctions.”

The EU should wield the policies, which might influence the authorities in Kiev, he said, adding that it was important for Kiev to espouse a more reasonable line of conduct towards the regions.

“That’s our assessment and it fully applies to the US policies, too,” Ryabkov said."
