"BEIJING, May 13. /ITAR-TASS/. The agenda of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forthcoming talks in China will be intensive, Russian Ambassador in China Andrei Denisov said at a presentation of the collection of articles and speeches of the Russian leader translated into Chinese that was held at the Russian Embassy in Beijing on Tuesday.

“The presidents will discuss a broad range of issues in bilateral strategic partnership in political, economic, humanitarian spheres and international affairs,” Denisov said.

“A little more than 20 years ago Russia and China succeeded to reach an unprecedentedly high level of comprehensive strategic partnership, which is based on mutual respect and trust, taking into account mutual interests, mutually beneficial cooperation and non-interference in domestic affairs,” he said. “Contacts between the leaders of our countries play an important role in the process of mutual rapprochement between Russia and China. Russia praises the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping had made his first foreign visit after taking the post of president to Moscow in March 2013. Then, leaders of our countries met several more times and President Vladimir Putin’s visit to China will certainly be an important landmark event in relations between our leaders,” Denisov said, adding that “Moscow and Beijing value special nature of bilateral partnership and consider its further development as a priority trend of their foreign policy.”

The Russian president will pay an official visit to China on May 20-21."
