"KIEV, April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine's extremist organization Right Sector has moved its headquarters from Kiev to Dnepropetrovsk, said its leader Dmitry Yarosh who is running for president.

It's easier to monitor the situation in Donbass from Dneptropetrovsk, Yarosh said on Wednesday.

Earlier, local media reported a meeting in camera between Yarosh and head of the Dneptropetrovsk regional administration Igor Kolomoisky.

The Right Sector leader denied receiving funding from oligarchs. We're not using oligarchs' money in politics, but when a war is on, we do not object to their funding the army, he said.

On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Right Sector, despite the Geneva accords, remained quite active.

We agreed in Geneva that any violence should be stopped, the diplomat said. But the next day, /parliament-appointed acting President/ Turchinov ordered the army to shoot at unarmed people participating in peaceful protests. In Geneva, we also agreed that extremists should be disarmed, but Right Sector is still active.

In Russia, the Investigative Committee opened a criminal case against Yarosh on charges of public calls for terrorist and extremist activities which he had made through mass media. Yarosh was put on the international wanted list. Moscow's Basmanny court sanctioned his arrest in absentia."
