"MOSCOW, May 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia has allocated about ˆ600,000 to the budget of the OSCE monitoring mission in Ukraine, Russia’s Permanent Representative at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Andrei Kelin said on Friday.

“Russia has been supporting the work of the special monitoring mission in Ukraine,” the Russian foreign ministry quoted him as saying at a meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council in Vienna. “I was commissioned to announce that the Russian government had taken a decision to allocate up to ˆ600,000 as a contribution to its budget. This money will be transferred to the account.”

Touching on the situation around observers from the OSCE mission in Ukraine’s south-eastern Donetsk region, Kelin said Russian was worried over this situation. “Moscow is seriously worried over these incidents,” he said. “The Russia side is taking all possible measure within its range of competence to have the OSCE observers released. However, we would like to draw attention to the fact that the responsibility for their fate rests on the Ukrainian side as a host party."
