"KIEV, May 23 /ITAR-TASS/. Sergei Tigipko, a candidate for Ukrainian president in the snap presidential elections scheduled for May 25, said on Friday his country should waste no time to restore economic relations with Russia.

“Since the beginning of the year, Ukraine has lost 31% of its exports to Russia,” he said during debates televised by the First National Channel. “First we should change the government and begin talks [with Russia] on economic issues in order to preserve jobs in Ukraine, for the sake of Ukrainians working in Russia, for our market in Russia."
