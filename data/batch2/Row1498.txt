"MOSCOW, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday, May 8, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov voiced serious concern about Kiev’s reaction to the results of the Russian-Swiss talks in Moscow on May 7 and its refusal to stop using the army and national radicals against protesters in the south-eastern regions of Ukraine, the Foreign Ministry said.

“On May 8 a telephone conversation was held on the American initiative between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

“The Russian minister urged the United States to use its influence with the Kiev authorities in order to push them towards real de-escalation of the situation and creation of conditions for a direct and equal dialogue with representatives of the south-eastern regions,” the ministry said.

Lavrov stressed the need for Kiev to stop the army operation in the South-East of Ukraine, unblock cities and towns there, free political prisoners and begin comprehensive constitutional reform.

He drew Kerry’s attention to the Moscow meeting between the presidents of Russia and Switzerland on May 7 where they discussed the OSCE initiative for the implementation of the Geneva Statement of April 17.

The Russian minister and the U.S. secretary agreed to maintain close contact on Ukraine in the days to come in light of the proposals put forth by the Swiss OSCE Chairmanship, the Foreign Ministry said."
