"MOSCOW, May 26 (RIA Novosti) – Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Turkish counterpart, Ahmet Davutoglu, are scheduled to meet in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss a range of pressing foreign policy issues including the crisis in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich told RIA Novosti in an interview Monday.

“The ministers will discuss the crisis in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, including in Syria, and in North Africa. We will continue our dialog on the Iranian nuclear program, the situation in the South Caucasus, in Central Asia and in the Balkans,” Lukashevich told RIA Novosti.

He added the two foreign policy chiefs will also look at Russian-Turkish cooperation in international organizations. “Russia and Turkey have similar or identical stances on a wide range of global and regional issues, and we are intent to continue out constructive opinion exchange,” the spokesman noted.

Lukashevich said both countries placed a high priority on their bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the Black Sea, as well as on closer interaction within the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, which is aimed at fostering harmony among Black Sea nations.

Moscow and Ankara base their cooperation on the existing regional and global challenges and are to decide what it takes to boost the efficiency of such interactions to secure sustainable development, Lukashevich told RIA Novosti.

“Significant attention will be paid to urgent questions dealing with trade and economic ties,” he said.

While in Moscow, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu will chair a meeting of the Joint Strategic Planning Group (JSPG), a sub-body of the High Level Cooperation Council that unites Black Sea neighbors.

“Russia expects the upcoming JSPG session to contribute to stronger friendship and partnership ties between Russia and Turkey,” Lukashevich said."
