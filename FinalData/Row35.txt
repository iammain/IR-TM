"“Unless our powers are returned to us in full Russia will most likely refrain from participation in PACE events, particularly a PACE session in June. It can be said with confidence that Russia will not participate in this session,” Pushkov said.

Earlier, the PACE has adopted a resolution regarding Russia: the Russian delegation has been stripped of the voting right in the Assembly for Crimea’s accession and expulsed from all ruling institutions until the end of the year. 145 members have cast affirmative votes, 21 deputies voted against the resolution and 22 abstained.

Then Russian delegation has left the PACE spring session due to restriction of its powers."
