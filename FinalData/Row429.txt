"BEIJING, May 07. /ITAR-TASS/. Beijing opposes Washington's sanctions it applies in international relations “with every pretext”, Chinese Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday commenting on potential US sectoral sanctions against Russia.

“We are concerned about the current situation in Ukraine. China is firmly opposing the use of sanctions with any pretext or threats of sanctions in international relations,” said the diplomat, adding that China called on the sides “to remain calm and moderate”.

“We believe the sides should start a political dialogue as soon as possible to promptly ease the tension” in line with Geneva agreements and refrain from any actions that would fuel tension, said Hua Chunying.

The US would introduce sanctions against entire economic sectors of Russia if Moscow recognized the results of the upcoming independence referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk and brought its troops to the regions, reported ITAR-TASS correspondent in Washington.

According to ITAR-TASS correspondent’s reports from the UN, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has urged Russia, Ukraine, the US and EU to go back to the negotiating table to find out why Geneva agreements of April 17 had failed."
