Obama welcomed the leadership of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces and “constructive approach” to dialogue. “Obama welcomed the Coalition’s leadership and constructive approach to dialogue, and encouraged the Coalition to further its vision for an inclusive government,” the White House statement said.

Obama joined his National Security Advisor Susan Rice's meeting with al-Jarba in Washington. The US leader said that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had lost his legitimacy and had no place in the country’s future. 

The delegations also discussed the risks posed by growing extremism in Syria and agreed on the need to counter terrorist groups on all sides of the conflict, the White House said.

Earlier, the US announced its decision to boost non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition by $27 million, bringing total assistance to $287 million."
