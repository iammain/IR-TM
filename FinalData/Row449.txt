"Dozens of FBI, CIA agents in Kiev 'assisting Ukraine security'

Numerous US agents are helping the coup-appointed government in Ukraine to “fight organized crime” in the south east of the country, the German newspaper Bild revealed.


  According to the daily, the CIA and FBI are advising the
  government in Kiev on how to deal with the ‘fight against
  organized crime’ and stop the violence in the country’s restive
  eastern regions.



  The group also helps to investigate alleged financial crimes and
  is trying to trace the money, which was reportedly taken abroad
  during Viktor Yanokovich’s presidency, the newspaper said.



  The head of the CIA, John Brennan, visited Kiev in mid-April and
  met with the acting Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and first
  Vice-President Vitaly Yarema to discuss a safer way to transfer
  US information to Ukraine.



  Jen Psaki, spokeswomen for the United States Department of State,
  said that there was nothing to read into Brennan’s visit to Kiev,
  and that the head of the CIA did not offer support to the
  coup-appointed government in the country to help them conduct
  tactical operations within Ukraine.



  However, following the visit the toppled President Viktor
  Yanukovich linked the CIA chief’s appearance in Kiev to the first
  stage of the new government’s crackdown in Slavyansk.



  Brennan “sanctioned the use of weapons and provoked
  bloodshed,” Yanukovich said.



  Bild’s reports comes as US President Barack Obama rules out that
  Washington will interfere in the situation in Ukraine.


“You’ve also seen suggestions or implications that somehow
  Americans are responsible for meddling inside Ukraine. I have to
  say that our only interest is for Ukraine to be able to make its
  own decisions. And the last thing we want is disorder and chaos
  in the center of Europe,” he said speaking in the White
  House after meeting the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, just
  two days ago."
