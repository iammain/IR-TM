"MOSCOW, May 6 (RIA Novosti) – The Russian Ministry of Defense has decided to hold an unscheduled discussion on the Ukrainian crisis at the upcoming International Security Conference in Moscow, the head of the ministry’s Foreign Military Cooperation Directorate told journalists Tuesday.

“I would like to underline that we are concerned with the future of Ukraine. That is why, despite the fact that the question of the stabilization of the situation in Ukraine was not included on the conference calendar, we will be ready for the discussion,” said Sergei Koshelev.

He added that there are no strict regulations for the speeches of the forum’s participants and experts would be also able to express their opinion on the topic of the European Ballistic Missile Defense System. Koshelev noted that Moscow has not changed its view on the issue.

“Unfortunately, we have to state that our NATO partners are in fact refusing to conduct an expert dialogue on the missile defense issue, substituting it for political slogans. This state of affairs as well as the latest statements made by the leadership of the alliance, strengthen our confidence in the fact that NATO and US missile defense system share an anti-Russian potential, which will only increase in time,” Koshelev said.

The conference will be held in Moscow on May 23-24. The discussion is planned to include the latest events in the Middle East, North Africa and Afghanistan. More than 40 countries and international organizations have confirmed their attendance. Representatives of the US have refused to participate."
