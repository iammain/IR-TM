"MOSCOW, May 14 (RIA Novosti) – The Western sanctions against Russia are totally absurd, Sergei Naryshkin, the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, said Wednesday.

I estimate all this as complete absurdity uttered by those who make such decisions – decisions on economic sanctions and sanctions against my colleagues, members of the State Duma and the Federation Council [the lower and upper houses of Russia’s parliament], and me personally, Naryshkin told TV channel Russia 24.

The State Duma Speaker noted that he still cannot understand the logic behind the decision of Washington and Brussels to place him on the sanctions list.

“Did they really expect that I would change my decision, my opinion, position regarding reunification of Russia with Crimea? I will never change this decision. I am very proud of the fact that I played a role in this great historical event, the reunification of Crimea with Russia, the speaker said.

On Monday, the EU added two Crimean companies and 13 individuals to a sanctions list over the escalating situation in Ukraine.

Since March, the US and EU have imposed targeted sanctions against Russian officials, freezing their assets and banning them from obtaining visas, as well as against 17 Russian companies.

The leaders of the G7 group of nations have further threatened Russia with sanctions against key sectors of the country’s economy in the event of a further escalation in the Ukrainian crisis.

Moscow has repeatedly stated that the language of sanctions is “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warned its Western partners about the “boomerang effect” that sanctions would have."
