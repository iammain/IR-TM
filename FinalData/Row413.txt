"US judge temporarily halts force-feeding of Guantanamo prisoner

For the first time, a US federal judge has temporarily barred the US military from force-feeding a Guantanamo Bay prisoner on a hunger strike.


  US District Court Judge Gladys Kessler ordered the military not
  to force-feed Syrian national Abu Wa'el Dhiab until the court
  schedules a hearing for next Wednesday. The decision was based on
  a petition the prisoner filed to stop the enteral feeding
  practice.



  The order also prevents military personnel from moving Dhiab from
  his cell to receive sustenance, which is usually done if the
  prisoner refuses to cooperate.


Respondents are temporarily restrained from any Forcible
  Cell Extractions of Petitioner for purposes of enteral feeding
  and any enteral feeding of Petitioner until May 21, 2014,
  Kessler said in her order.



  Last July, Kessler decided not to consider Dhiab's petition,
  citing her lack of authority, while at the same time urging US
  President Barack Obama to address the issue.



  The case was reinstated in February by a federal appeals court
  which ruled that district court judges have the authority to
  consider such petitions, adding that force-feeding is likely
  legal if the overall goal is to prevent serious injury or death.



  An appellate panel agreed in a 2-1 vote, opening the door for inmates’
  attorneys to re-challenge their clients’ ongoing detainment and
  any force-feeding practices they endured while protesting their
  lengthy incarceration.



  The prisoners' protest – which began with six hunger strikers in
  March 2013 – hit a high last summer, with over 100 inmates opting
  out of meals during most of June and July. The number of
  prisoners receiving enteral feeds peaked at 46 detainees in the
  second half of July."
