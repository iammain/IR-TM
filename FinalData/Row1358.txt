"KIEV, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – A homemade bomb has exploded in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, killing one soldier and wounding another, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said Monday.

When on duty, in the course of daily inspection of reinforcing obstacles, two contract soldiers of the armed forces of Ukraine were injured. According to preliminary information, the cause of injury was the explosion of an unknown improvised explosive device, the statement said.

The wounded soldier, a junior sergeant, is in intensive care and military doctors have said he is expected to live, the ministry said, adding that the injured man was transported by helicopter to a hospital in Kharkiv.

Federalization supporters in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Gorlovka, Slaviansk and Kramatorsk have refused to recognize the legitimacy of the current Ukrainian government and are urging interim authorities to hold referendums similar to the one held in Crimea last month, which led to the republic's reunification with Russia."
