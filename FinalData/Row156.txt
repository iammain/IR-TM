"MOSCOW, May 12 (RIA Novosti) – A roadmap on a possible resolution to the Ukrainian crisis drafted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has not been made public because of the positions of Washington and Kiev, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday.

“We are convinced that this must be done, as soon as possible, … but some people in Washington and Kiev are against the participation of the regions in the dialogue, that’s why … in spite of our readiness, the Road map elaborated by OSCE Chairman [Didier Burkhalter] was not made public,” Lavrov said.

Lavrov added that not disclosing the road map, which Russia received on May 8, again confirms that Kiev “has not yet acknowledged the necessity to talk to its own people.”

The Russian minister earlier called on equitable dialogue between the authorities in Kiev and pro-federalization activists in southeastern Ukraine with mediation by the OSCE.

French Ambassador to Russia Jean-Maurice Ripert earlier told RIA Novosti the OSCE had been debating a package of measures to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine.

He said the organization regarded the upcoming presidential election on May 25 and the subsequent creation of a lawful government in Ukraine as one of the key steps to promote peace in the country.

An early presidential election was scheduled in Ukraine on May 25 after President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted late February following mass rallies."
