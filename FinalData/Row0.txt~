"Dutch MP Geert Wilders: EU cares about expansion, not Ukraine

The EU is responsible for “the mess” in Ukraine, Geert Wilders, Holland's Party for Freedom leader,  told RT.  Wilders wonders why the bloc has got involved in a country where half the population is against joining Europe.

  Wilders, who was speaking exclusively on RT’s SophieCo, believes
  the EU should have kept out of the conflict and only made things
  worse by giving the country hopes of a pre-accession treaty to
  the union, when the people of Ukraine were not in unison about
  joining the organization.


“It was a very delicate balance in Ukraine with 50 percent
  looking eastwards, towards Russia, and 50 percent of the
  population looking westwards, towards the European Union. So I
  think it was very irresponsible what the EU did; they should have
  kept out of it,” Wilders said.



  The leader of the right-wing Party for Freedom criticized politicians
  from Europe, the US and from his home country for appearing in
  Kiev and giving the impression that Ukraine had the complete
  support of the West while completely ignoring the fact that
  Ukraine remains a very complex situation.


“I believe Europe was more thinking about itself and
  expanding it and its territory than really thinking about the
  whole of Ukraine, let alone the stability in that region.”


  Wilders admits he understands the gripes of those living in the
  east of the country, who were unhappy when the coup-appointed
  government took power in Kiev. “The best thing to do is to
  de-escalate by taking the Russian minority in eastern Ukraine
  seriously; give them rights and make them really feel as
  important as the other half of Ukraine,” the 50 year-old
  Eurosceptic continued.



  The Dutch politician says Russia is also partly to blame and that
  retaining the territorial integrity of Ukraine is of the utmost
  importance.


“I’m not only blaming the EU, I’m blaming both Russia and the
  EU. But I have to be honest, the European Union made a terrible
  move in the beginning of November last year, and they at least
  partially started a lot of the troubles, and that analysis is
  shared by more parties in the EU for sure,” said the leader
  of the Party for Freedom.



  The US and the EU recently introduced more economic sanctions
  against Russia as they believe the country is having a
  destabilizing effect on Ukraine. However, Wilders says this will
  help neither the Russians nor the EU and cannot have a
  “positive effect.”


  Wilders has achieved success in his native Netherlands on a
  ticket of euro skepticism and is adamant that his
  country should leave the EU. “We can deal better economically
  when we are in charge of our country, again, when it comes to
  national sovereignty – so, yes, we would like to leave the EU and
  be stronger as a national country,” the Dutchman said.



  Wilders cites the example of Switzerland, as a model that his
  country could follow, with the Alpine nation being one of the
  richest on the continent, despite never having joined the EU.


“We lost our identity; we lost our national sovereignty to
  the EU, an institution that really a lot of people in the West
  don’t like so much anymore. I have nothing against Europe, but I
  have a lot against the EU as an organization,” Wilders
  concluded.
