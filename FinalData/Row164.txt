"“We, unfortunately, have no possibility to express condolences to official Kiev, according to the international practice, because there is no official Kiev as such,” Peskov said. “But nevertheless, the president expresses his condolences to the relatives of those killed and burned alive in Odessa and wishes the earliest recovery to those injured in the mentioned punitive operation.”

In the words of Peskov, Russian president feels keen sorrow and compassion for those killed as a result of punitive action of the Kiev authorities and those injured. According to Peskov, the tragedy of Odessa, where nationalists and radicals burned unarmed people alive with the obvious connivance of the authorities - it’s indeed a crime."
