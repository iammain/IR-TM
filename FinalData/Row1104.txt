"“Russian presidential special envoy Vladimir Lukin was sent to Donetsk Region (east Ukraine) the other day at the request of our Western partners and in co-operation with the Council of Europe leadership to settle current situation with military specialists from several European countries detained in the city of Sloviansk (east Ukraine),” the statement runs.

“We demand taking exhaustive measures to ensure security of the Russian envoy, because we do not rule a provocation from Kiev rulers to foil his mission which is already exposed to a threat over aggressive actions of Ukrainian army and radical gunmen around the city of Sloviansk,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said."
