"MANAGUA, April 30. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ends his visit to Nicaragua and leaves for an official visit to Chile, where he will meet for talks with President Michelle Bachelet and his Chilean counterpart Heraldo Munoz.

“The visit is aimed at the development and diversification of bilateral partnership, at giving a boost to the whole range of Russian-Chilean relations, including a political dialogue, trade, economic, scientific-technical and humanitarian ties,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said.

At the talks, the ministers will focus on bilateral cooperation in APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation), will look into integration processes in Latin America within a broad international context, as well as will discuss prospects for Russia’s political dialogue with regional agencies.

The foreign ministers will also discuss an expansion and updating of contractual legal framework and the speedup of preparations for the signing of a number of bilateral documents. “Priority attention will be paid to extension of trade-economic and investment cooperation,” the ministry said.

“Chile is a friendly state to Russia, one of our major partners in Latin America. This year marks the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries,” it said.

“Moscow and Santiago come out in favor of the strengthening of the principle of multilateral approach in international affairs, the strengthening of a central role of the United Nations, as well as seek cooperation in different formats to have a democratic, safe and just world order,” it added. “This creates a favorable basis for a further expansion of our cooperation on the international arena, including within the framework of the UN Security Council, where Chile has a seat for the 2014-2015 period,” the ministry said."
