"BRUSSELS, May 12 (RIA Novosti) – The foreign ministers of EU member states have approved sanctions against two Crimean companies and 13 individuals over the situation in Ukraine, a diplomatic source in the EU told RIA Novosti.

“The sanctions against two Crimean companies and 13 persons were adopted. I will not mention their citizenship. They will be published in the EU official journal later today,” the source said.

The publication concerning the sanctions in the official journal of the European Union would mean they had entered into force.

Since March, the US and EU have imposed targeted sanctions against Russian officials, freezing their assets and banning visas, as well as against 17 Russian companies, over the country’s reunification with the former Ukrainian republic of Crimea.

In addition, the leaders of the G7 group of nations have threatened Russia with sanctions against key sectors of economy in case of a further escalation of Ukrainian crisis.

Moscow has repeatedly stated that the language of sanctions is inappropriate and counterproductive and warned the Western partners about the boomerang effect that sanctions would have. Some EU members already raised their voice against the possible new sanctions against Russia, as they could damage the European economy."
