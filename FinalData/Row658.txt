"BRUSSELS, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – The EU regards as appropriate targeted, not broad, sanctions against Russia amid the current ongoing crisis in Ukraine, European Commission spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen said Monday.

“It is very clear in the conclusion of the European Council that is that if there is further escalation that would be the time for the European Union to consider the switch to phase three [sanctions],” Hansen said, referring to broad economic sanctions against entire sectors of the Russian economy.

“Now we are in a situation where there is no de-escalation, we therefore currently consider that these extra measures of the asset freezes and travel bans as being the appropriate level for the time being whilst moving forward with the preparation of measures for phase three,” she said.

Senior sources earlier told RIA Novosti that the EU intends to expand Monday the list sanctions individuals connected with the situation in Ukraine, including visa bans and asset freezes. The EU refers to sanctions targeting named individuals or businesses “phase two” sanctions.

The US and EU earlier imposed targeted sanctions against Moscow over its reunification with Crimea, a former region of Ukraine that held a referendum in March in which 96 percent of population voted for integration with Russia.

The assets of several Russian politicians, lawmakers and businessmen, were frozen and they were banned from receiving visas. The G7 countries also threatened Russia with broad economic sanctions in case of further escalation of the situation in Ukraine."
