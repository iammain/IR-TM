"MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia urged Sunday the Organization for Security and Cooperation of Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe to immediately evaluate the situation in Ukraine in an objective manner.

At a time when Ukrainian punitive squads are conducting their operations in Eastern Ukraine cleansing some communities and blocking others, the West has imposed an actual information blockade on the tragic developments taking place in that country, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Even in OSCE circles, Moscow said, nobody knew blood was shed and troops were shooting at unarmed people in Ukraine.

We demand that the relevant institutions of OSCE and the Council of Europe immediately give an objective evaluation of the developments in Ukraine, it added.

Also on Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said Russia was indignant that Kiev authorities had not fulfilled the Feb. 21 accord and the April 17 Geneva statement.

Punitive actions continue in south-eastern Ukraine. Radical elements are acting absolutely impermissibly in the south, Itar- Tass news agency quoted him as saying.

Ukraine launched a major attack against pro-Russian forces around the eastern city of Slaviansk in the early hours of Friday. On the same day, at least 46 people were killed and over 170 others injured in clashes between pro- and anti-government protesters in the southern city of Odessa.

Russia accused Kiev authorities of being direct accomplices in the events in Odessa, saying their hands are full of blood, while Kiev said Moscow should be responsible for the deadly clashes.

What happened in Odessa was part of a plan by the Russian Federation to destroy Ukraine and its statehood ... Russia sent people here to create chaos, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk said Sunday.
