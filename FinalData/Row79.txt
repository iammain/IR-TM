"DONETSK, May 01,  /ITAR-TASS/. Three officers of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) can soon be exchanged for the supporters of federalisation seized by the Kiev authorities, Denis Pushilin, co-chair of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), told ITAR-TASS by telephone on Thursday, May 1.

“The three SBU officers may be exchanged for our three activists on May 2,” Pushilin said.

Last Sunday, April 27, the Donetsk region’s militia captured three SBU commandoes - a lieutenant-colonel, a mayor and a captain who had come from Kiev. DPR officials said the group’s mission was to reconnoiter and seize one of the local self-defence activists."
