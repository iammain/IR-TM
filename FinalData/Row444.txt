"MOSCOW, May 20. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev discussed the situation in Ukraine and US policy towards Russia in an interview with Bloomberg TV.

Medvedev said that US sanctions against Russia mean that the US administration is heading towards a dead-end. “We are slowly but surely moving toward a second Cold War, which no one needs,” the prime minister said. “A competent politician how to make reserved, careful, subtle, wise and careful decisions, which, I believe, Mr. Obama succeeded at for a while. But what is being done now unfortunately proves that the US Administration has run out of those resources, and the United States is one of the parties to suffer from this,” Medvedev added. The prime minister also noted that US President Barack Obama “lacks political tact”.

Medvedev said he was personally disappointed by the way Obama is handling the crisis in Ukraine. “I’m very sorry that what we achieved then, the results we got, are now being reduced to zero,” he said, speaking about the ‘reset’ in relations between Russia and the US."
