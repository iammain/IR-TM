"SOFIA, April 27. /ITAR-TASS/. There are no grounds to impose economic sanctions against Russia, Sergei Stanishev, the leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, said on Sunday, adding that problems in relations between Russia and Ukraine could be resolved by political means.

“The crisis in relations between Russia and Ukraine can be settled only by political means,” he told journalists. In his words, any other tools used to settle the crisis situation in Ukraine would only create a “spiral of tension,” reviving the “cold war” rhetoric and prompting actions that only aggravated the conflict.

“I see no grounds to impose economic sanctions against Russia,” he stressed. “Someone may find it easy to suggest such instruments [sanctions], but we think that this is a road to nowhere and for that reason we insist on a political dialogue."
