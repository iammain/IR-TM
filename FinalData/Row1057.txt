"WASHINGTON, May 07.  /ITAR-TASS/. Ukrainian presidential candidate Valery Konovalyuk said Western sanctions against Russia were senseless and actually harmful for his country and the whole of Eastern Europe.

“The path of sanctions against Russia leads nowhere,” he said at the National Press Club in Washington on Wednesday, May 7. “These sanctions can adversely affect Ukraine and some of the East European countries in the first place.”

“Russia can just switch over to advance payments for energy supplies to Ukraine or limit Ukrainian import to its market and this will cause a massive collapse of the national Ukrainian economy,” said Konovalyuk, a politician and an economist, who previously worked as first deputy chair of the budget committee in the Ukrainian parliament and began his career in the executive bodies of the eastern Donetsk region and its capital Donetsk.

“When the industrial east of Ukraine comes to a halt, a new and harder wave of social protests will rise,” he warned.

Replying to a question whether the present authorities in Kiev were not complying with the agreement reached in Geneva on April 17, Konovalyuk said, “The new government has undoubtedly made a number of strategic mistakes over the past two months”, the main of which is that “it has completely ignored the positions and demands of people living in the South-East of Ukraine”.

“The new government is unable to take measures to de-escalate the conflict, restore order and bring to justice those who are trying to destabilise the situation with weapons,” he said."
