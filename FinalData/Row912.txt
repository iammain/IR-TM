"I believe that the referendum in Ukraine are the internal affair of that country. China's foreign policy course implies non-interference in the domestic policy of foreign states, Cheng Guoping said. The legitimate interests of all peoples in Ukraine should be respected.

On Monday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the settlement of the Ukrainian issue should meet the just, legitimate and reasonable demands of the parties comprehensively, in a balanced way and in full measure.

On May 11, Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions held referenda on the status of these regions amid the ongoing punitive operation launched by the Kiev authorities. According to the Central Election Commission, some 80% of the electorate took part in the voting in the Donetsk region and approximately as many in the Luhasnk region. The referenda were held in connection with the declaration of Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in April.

Independence of the provinces was supported, respectively, by 89.7% and 96.2% of voters."
