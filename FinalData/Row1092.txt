"“There is the risk that the companies on which sanctions are imposed may lose technical support and at worst - the right to use software licences of foreign, as a rule, American, developers,” Sychyov said.

He explained that the possibility of revocation of the software licence depends on the terms of a concrete contract. “As for the technical support, despite the fact that the support in Russia is provided, as a rule, by Russian system integrators, there may be problems with updating software, including updates that are critical from the viewpoint of information security,” Sychyov said.

Gazety.ru reported on Wednesday that Microsoft, Oracle, Symantec and Hewlett-Packard have joined the American sanctions and are preparing for switching off the software for the companies that are put on the sanctions list.

First stage of US sanctions against Russia

The USA imposed sanctions against Russia in response to its stance over Crimea’s status. March 17, the USA announced a black list including 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials. In March and April, the list has been expanded several times. To date, the list includes several dozens of people, who, as US authorities believe, undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. In addition, the USA has suspended cooperation with Russia in the field of combating drug trafficking and in the space industry (except for the International Space Station project), and introduced restrictions for supplying military and double-purpose products to Russia."
