"KIEV, May 13. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry has called the roadmap on the crisis settlement worked out by the Swiss presidency in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) an “auxiliary instrument”.

Ukraine believes the “key thing in the current situation” is “complete and conditional fulfillment by all parties, including Russia, of the Geneva communiqu?,” Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Yevgen Perebyinis said, adding that the Swiss roadmap would be an “important auxiliary instrument” in this process.

“A settlement plan should allocate the leading role to Ukraine, it should be a purely Ukrainian plan,” he said. “The Ukrainian government is promoting its own roadmap. It has some things in common with the OSCE roadmap but the settlement process should be Ukrainian.”

“We are doing our best to stabilize the situation in the country. We have initiated a dialogue with eastern and western regions of the country,” Yatsenyuk said, adding that members of the Ukrainian cabinet of ministers had visited eastern regions to discuss issues of the decentralization of power and protection of Russian-speakers and other national minorities, anti-corruption measures and social problems. “We are maintaining nationwide dialogue and are conducting nationwide roundtable consultations. Ukraine has its own roadmap to settle the situation."
