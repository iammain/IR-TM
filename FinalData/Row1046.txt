"MOSCOW, May 15. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian defense enterprises intend to move into the markets of countries that used to buy weapons from the United States and Europe, Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation (FSMTC) Director Alexander Fomin told ITAR-TASS on Thursday, May 15.

Russia’s aircraft Su-30, MiG-29 and Yak-130 are most popular among foreign partners and make up over 40% of all arms exports.

Air defense systems take up another big chunk of the market. “Russia accounts for about one-third of global air defense system supplies, which makes up to 20% of Russia’s military weapons and equipment export operations.

The next most popular items of export are naval equipment, such as Project 636 submarines, Gepard escort ships, missile and patrol boats, and Army hardware (air defense missile systems, anti-tank missiles, armored and light armored vehicles, close combat weapons, and firearms).

Countries in sub-Saharan Africa buy most often helicopters, armored vehicles and ammunition for them, air defense systems, and firearms.

Latin American countries buy mainly aircraft, helicopters, armored vehicles, and air defense systems. Lately, they have also been showing interest in Russian patrol and landing ships and submarines.

Among the most successful agreements on military-technical cooperation made in 2014, Fomin named the ones with Armenia and Kazakhstan."
