"MEXICO City, April 30 (RIA Novosti) – Peru hopes that free trade zone talks with Russia will lead to a beneficial experience exchange between the two nations, Peru’s Foreign Minister Eda Rivas told RIA Novosti.

“We proposed to go ahead with a free trade agreement, which offers possibilities for experience exchange. As for economic cooperation, our goal is to expand and diversify exports, including non-traditional exports, and promote investment,” Eda Rivas said.

This comes ahead of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s planned visit to Peru later today. The Russian foreign policy chief is to meet with his Peruvian counterpart Eda Rivas and President Ollanta Humala, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry.

“I hope for an open dialog where we will look in detail at all the main points of our rich bilateral agenda. It is the 45th anniversary of our diplomatic relations which is marked against the backdrop of strengthening bilateral ties in the sphere of education, health, science and technology, military and technical cooperation, among others. And I hope for more progress,” Ms. Rivas told RIA Novosti.

In 2013, Peru offered Russia to set up a free trade zone. Russia’s exports to Peru include fertilizers, metal rolls, aircraft spare parts, and petroleum produce. On the list of its imports are lead and zinc concentrates, fish flour, frozen fish and other seafood."
