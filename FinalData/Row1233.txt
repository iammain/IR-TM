"KIEV, April 27. /ITAR-TASS/. Secretary General of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Lamberto Zannier will arrive in Kiev late on Sunday, Ukraine’s parliament-appointed Foreign Minister Andrei Deshchitsa said on Sunday.

“The situation over the release of OSCE observers [in Slavyansk] remains difficult,” he said. “I am returning to Kiev. OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier is coming to Kiev in the evening too.”

On Sunday, Deshchitsa attended a ceremony of the Canonization of Blessed John XXIII and Pope John Paul II in Vatican City.

Earlier on Sunday, members of the group of international military observers from OSCE took part in a news conference in Slavyansk. One of them said the observers were not captives but “guests of Mayor Ponomarev.”

On Friday, April 25, supporters of federalization in Slavyansk, a city in the southeast of Ukraine, detained a bus with passengers, with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities.

The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures."
