"KIEV, April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. Supporters of Ukraine's federalization who have occupied the building of the country’s Security Service in the eastern city of Luhansk say they will vacate the building and lay down arms if a candidate of their choice will be appointed governor of the Luhansk region, presidential candidate Serhiy Tihipko said on Monday.

“They have their own candidate for governorship and if that person is appointed, indeed, they will lay down arms and vacate the building,” Tihipko said.

Along with it, he said that the demand had been voiced in a telephone conversation by one of the activists.

The proposal was handed to representatives of the Kiev administration three days ago and the protesters simply could not understand why the government was not making any steps in that direction, Tihipko said.

Tihipko believes it would be reasonable to meet the demand. “I would make the appointment within an hour after I had heard it because they would have found themselves in a very awkward position if they had failed to vacate the building,” he said."
