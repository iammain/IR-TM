“There are no winners or losers here. This is a friendly game. It’s a show and everyone enjoyed it. All this [the Night Hockey League] was invented to give an additional boost to the development of sports and physical culture,” Putin said after the award ceremony and said he was talking about mass sports.

The Night Hockey League was created for the purpose of developing amateur hockey with the support of the president and Russian ice hockey veterans."
