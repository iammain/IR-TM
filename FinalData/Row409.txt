"KIEV, April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine is considering the possibility to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organization over restrictions on supplies of goods to Russia, parliament-appointed Minister of Economic Development and Trade Pavel Sheremeta told reporters on Wednesday.

We're studying the issue; we'll lodge /the complaint/ as soon as we're ready, he said.

Sheremeta said government decisions alone were not sufficient for lodging a complaint as the procedure required complaints from business people as well. The official said such complaints were already on hand without specifying the sources.

Last week, parliament-appointed Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk said Ukraine would be defending its right to free trade with all countries, including with the Russian Federation. This right will be defended by all methods, including through WTO, Yatsenyuk said."
