"“China is committed to the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs,” Hua Chunying said. “We respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

The official added that resolution of the crisis “should completely meet the legitimate, justified and reasonable demands” of all parties concerned. Conflict in Ukraine should be settled “on the basis of law and order” and all parties should “solve disputes in a proper way”."
