"OSLO, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. The West’s interference into the situation in Ukraine gave life to a fascist monster, Norwegian academic, author of the two-volume book about the foreign policy of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union Bjorn Ditlef Nistad told ITAR-TASS.

Having supported the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych, he believes, the US and EU have created a monster they are refusing to notice. On the contrary, they assume that on May 25 the people of Ukraine can vote in a legitimate presidential election, and lay the blame on Russia’s support of separatists. Meanwhile, the Right Sector and other extremist groups enjoyed unrestricted freedom in many cities and were now using the regime in Ukraine to subdue protests in Ukraine’s East, said the historian.

Nistad doubted the possibility of legitimate elections in the current situation where opposition candidates are being threatened, far-right extremists rule the streets, while the government has unleashed a criminal military operation against the people of Eastern Ukraine who refuse to recognize the new authority. Nistad found the way Western media and politicians shut their eyes to the events, even after the tragedy in Odessa, detestable and hypocritical."
