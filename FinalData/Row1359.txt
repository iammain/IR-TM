"Russian President Vladimir Putin led the military Thursday in major exercises that simulated a response to an attack. He did it from the National Defense Center.

Interfax reported that the exercise was planned in November. Putin himself presided over one of three intercontinental ballistic missile strikes, the news service said.

“We have all had a chance to see for ourselves the high readiness and concerted action of our country’s strategic offensive and defensive forces,” Putin said Thursday.

“Militant nationalism that once led to the emergence of the Nazi ideology is again rearing its head in Europe,” Putin added, according to Interfax. “We won’t dwell on each particular hotbed. We know where we face this danger.”

Putin was joined by the presidents of Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, there for a summit of the Collective Security Treaty Organization.
