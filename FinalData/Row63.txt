"“We have thoroughly studied the reports of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),” the diplomat noted. “The report distorts the real state of things in Ukraine.”

“A blind eye has been turned on blatant violations of fundamental human rights, including freedom of expression, by the Kiev authorities, which enjoy the support from the West,” Dolgov noted. “It lacks information about growing neo-Nazism, xenophobia, ultra-nationalism and anti-Semitism in Ukraine.”

“The OSCE mission seems to have no interest in the destructive role of the Maidan activists and the punitive operation against civilian population in Ukraine’s southeastern regions. Instead, the authors, upon the slimmest of evidence, speak about alleged human rights violations in Russia’s Republic of Crimea and Ukraine’s southeastern regions."
