"MOSCOW, April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow welcomes practical steps to reset the process of Palestinian reconciliation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, April 23.

It described as “important” the visit to Gaza by a Palestinian delegation from the West Bank that began on April 22. The delegation led by a Fatah Central Committee member, Azzam al-Ahmad, met with HAMAS leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh.

The two sides agreed to form a Palestinian technocratic government and hold general elections in keeping with the understanding reached earlier, the ministry said.

“We regard this as a step in the right direction. Moscow has always adhered to the opinion that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people cannot be fulfilled and a fair and lasting settlement between Israel and Palestine on the well-known international legal basis cannot be achieved without the consolidation of Palestinian ranks on the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] and the Arab Peace Initiative platform,” the ministry said.

The ministry said it would continue to assist Palestinians in achieving genuine national unity."
