"MOSCOW, May 07. /ITAR-TASS/. The denouncement by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay of the violence and lawlessness in Ukraine “confirms that the illegitimate Kiev authorities with the connivance of their Western patrons continue gross violation of the universally recognized human rights norms,” the Russian Foreign Ministry stated on Wednesday.

“We call on the de-facto government in Kiev to immediately stop the use of force against its own people and take concrete steps to begin reconciliation in the society,” the ministry stressed."
