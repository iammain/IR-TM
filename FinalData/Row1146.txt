"VIENNA, May 13, /ITAR-TASS/. Russia finds the sanctions imposed on it by the European Union to be highly regrettable, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters here Monday.

“We regret to see the sanctions train rolling downhill as if it doesn’t have an engine driver,” he said. “It’s an absolutely thoughtless and irresponsible policy that doesn’t match reality in any way."
