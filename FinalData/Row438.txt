"VLADIVOSTOK, May 14 /ITAR-TASS/. A naval squadron of Russia's Pacific Fleet (PF), led by the guided missile cruiser Varyag, sets out from Vladivostok on Wednesday to take part in the Russia-China Naval Interaction - 2014 exercises, which are to be held in the East China Sea.

A PF press service official said the squadron also includes the destroyer Bystry, the large anti-submarine ship Admiral Panteleyev, the large amphibious ship Admiral Nevelskoy, the tanker Ilim, and the sea-going tugboat Kalar. On the Chinese side, the exercises will involve six units of the combatant fleet destroyers, patrol boats and other ships.

The Naval Interaction exercises with the participation of the navies of Russia and China are held for a third time already. The latest such exercises were held in July 2013 in the Sea of Japan (East Sea), with about 20 ships from both sides participating. The exercises are aimed at strengthening practical cooperation between the navies of the two countries and counteracting various threats at sea.

The present exercises are due to begin after the Russian naval squadron, led by the Varyag, will call at the Chinese port of Shanghai."
