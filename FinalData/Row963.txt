"MOSCOW, May 12 (RIA Novosti) – Representatives of the European Commission have refused to attend an upcoming conference on Russian-EU energy cooperation, the deputy chairman of the energy committee in Russia’s lower house of parliament said Monday.

“More than 180 participants have registered for the conference, in particular over 80 representatives from Russia, but unfortunately representatives of the European Commission … have refused to attend due to the complex political situation,” said Pavel Zavalny, who is also the president of the Russian Gas Society.

Zavalny added that as of November, European officials were confident that the conference was necessary.

“It is very unfortunate that European officials are not taking part, although in November everybody agreed the conference was necessary and thanked us for holding it,” Zavalny noted.

The International Conference “Energy Dialogue: Russia-European Union” will be held on May 14 in Brussels for the ninth time. Representatives from over 100 countries will discuss important international energy issues, such as the EU’s third energy package and the prospects of further energy relations between Moscow and Brussels in the context of the current political standoff over the Ukrainian crisis."
