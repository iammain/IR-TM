"When asked why the American government continues punishing individual Russians or single Russian companies and does not impose broader sanctions on whole sectors of the Russian economy — the energy, financial or defense sectors — Kerry answered: “We're inches away from that now. And if they continue on this path, that's where it's heading.”

Regarding the developments in Ukraine, the USA has imposed further sanctions against seven Russian officials and 17 companies. In particular, the case in hand is freezing assets, which may be under Washington’s jurisdiction, as well as ban on American visas.

According to John Kerry, the already imposed sanctions have a certain economic and political effect. The Wall Street Journal notes that the best argument is the fact that Russia hasn’t sent its troops to Ukraine’s east."
