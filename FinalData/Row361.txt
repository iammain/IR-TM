"Reports indicate that the regional officials have left the building. The protesters are chanting the word ‘Referendum’, implying the widely popular demand of East-Ukrainian regions to hold a referendum on turning Ukraine into a federation.

An ultimatum to fulfill all the demands of the local population substantiated by the April 17 Geneva accords that the local protesters put forward to the authorities in Kiev expired at 14:00 hours local time Tuesday. In line with their previous warnings, the supporters of federalization are now considering all the agencies of power in Kiev to be anti-popular and criminal.

They also warned about their plans to go over to militant actions had the authorities failed to meet their expectations. However, they did not specify the character of their actions."
