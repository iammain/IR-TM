"LIMA, May 01 /ITAR-TASS/. Dialogue between Kiev government and its opponents could be established with the aid of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Russian Foreign Minister, who is making a visit to Peru, said after talks with his Peruvian counterpart Eda Rivas.

“Russia believes that the dialogue between the Kiev authorities and those who oppose them in other regions of the country could be set up by the OSCE,” Lavrov said. “We hope our Western counterparts who still have doubts in this regard will lift their objections and won’t put up obstacles to the Ukrainians’ attempts to strike an agreement with one another.”

“Whatever the situation, Russia and Peru support the dialogue in Ukraine anyway,” Lavrov said. “This is a fundamental task because the authorities in Kiev should feel and fulfill their responsibility. They should open dialogue with representatives of southeastern regions so as to reach consensus on how to live on.

Lavrov added that a deficit of information about situation in Ukraine existed in Latin America.  

“We’ve gotten an impression that a deficit of information on events in Ukraine exists in Latin America and we tried to make up for it,” Lavrov said. “Peruvian President said or conversation on the Ukrainian problem was very useful”. he said."
