"WARSAW, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The EU energy commissioner, energy ministers from Russia and Ukraine met here on Friday to discuss the Russia-Ukraine gas crisis and agreed that transit would not suffer in any way until the end of May.

Energy Commissioner of EU Guenther Oettinger stated at a press conference that the meeting had been a positive one where an agenda had been constructed for two further meetings in May.

According to Oettinger, the meetings will aim at short, medium and long-term problems and will concentrate in particular on the risk to supply stability.

Both sides showed good will and neither wanted further escalation, said Oettinger.

Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak claimed that the Ukrainian debt for gas already delivered increased by a further 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in April and reached a total of 3.5 billion U.S. dollars.

If we don't receive a pre-payment by 31st May, then Gazprom will be able to limit supplies to Ukraine, according to the contract, said Novak.

Novak also doubted the legality of the idea of Russian gas sold to the EU being sold back to Ukraine.

Ukrainian Energy Minister Jurij Prodan said that Ukraine was in no position to pay the price Russia is asking and that if no agreement can be reached with Gazprom then the matter will end up in the court of arbitration in Stockholm at the end of May.

The next meeting will take place in two weeks."
