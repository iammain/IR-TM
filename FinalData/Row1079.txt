"At a meeting with chairs of regional state administrations, Turchynov admitted that Kiev authorities did not control the situation in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

“The authorities do not control the situation in Donetsk and on the region’s territory. I want to say frankly that law enforcement agencies are not able to take control over the situation in Donetsk and Luhansk regions,” he stated.

Several attempts had been made to destabilise Kharkov, Odessa, Kherson, Nikolayev and Zaporozhye regions. Local administrations had been forced to tighten security for the May holidays, Turchinov said.

On Tuesday, Turchynov demanded from parliament-appointed Interior Minister Arsen Avakov to dismiss all heads of Interior Ministry’s regional departments in Luhansk and Donetsk regions. He added that “all representatives of local law enforcement agencies’ departments unable to fulfill thir professional duties will be fired”.

Oleksandr Turchynov stated that “there is no other way except from carrying out a complete renewal of the police and Ukraine’s State Security Service (SBU) in the country’s east”."
