"MOSCOW, May 09. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Victory Day remains Russia's main holiday, when invincible power of patriotism triumphs.

Sixty-nine years have passed since the end of the Great Patriotic War. But May 9 has been and will be our main holiday, said the head of state in his address at the Victory Day parade in Moscow's Red Square on Friday.

It is a day of national triumph and national pride, a day of grief and everlasting memory, he said.

It is a celebration of the invincible power of patriotism that triumphs when we all have a particularly acute feeling of what it means to be loyal to one's Motherland and how important it is to defend its interests, Putin said.

He noted that the people of Russia should keep the memory about the veterans who not only had defended the Motherland during the Great Patriotic War but also had rebuilt the country.
            

We'll never let you down; we'll take care of Russia, its glorious history, putting this glorious history above all, the president said, addressing war veterans. It has always been this way in our country and I'm sure it will be in the future.

Not only did you go through the troubled years of the war, you also rebuilt the country, working for the common good, you were friends, you were happy with life and bequeathed to hold the bar high - that of creativity, unity and love for Motherland, Putin said.

Putin, who is Supreme Commander-in-Chief, underlined that May 9 was veterans' holiday in the first place. We're giving you the warmth of our hearts, he said, adding that the country venerated the memory of those who had not lived to see this day."
