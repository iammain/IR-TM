"MOSCOW, May 02. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has urged the Ukrainian authorities to stop killing their own citizens.

“Those in power in the Ukrainian capital must come to their senses and stop killing their citizens, otherwise the country’s future lot might be very sad,” Medvedev wrote on his Facebook account.

He said that the use of force in the southeast of Ukraine was a “manifestation of a crime of feebleness of Kiev’s rulers.”

“Instead of taking effort to begin a normal dialogue in the spirit of the Geneva accords, to make parties to the conflict sit down at a negotiating table, to discuss compromise solutions, they launched a punitive operation using landing parties and helicopters. People are being killed, blood is flown,” Medvedev said. “Responsibility for the war against own people rests on those who take criminal decisions in Kiev."
