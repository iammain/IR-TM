"“The leaders of the two countries exchanged views on the crisis in Ukraine and stressed the need for all sides to comply with the Geneva accord of April 17,” the presidential press service said.

Putin and Renzi also “discussed, in a constructive manner, pressing issues of Russian-Italian cooperation in various areas, including the energy sector,” the press service said.

The Geneva statement adopted at a four-party meeting on Ukraine on Thursday, April 17, calls for a national dialogue in Ukraine. It calls for an immediate commencement of a broad national dialogue which must be inclusive, transparent and accountable. The measures to disarm illegal armed groups and free seized buildings would apply to all regions of Ukraine without exception."
