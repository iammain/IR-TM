"MOSCOW, April 28 (RIA Novosti) – Russia and Western countries will continue investment cooperation despite possible economic sanctions against Moscow, Russian business rights ombudsman Boris Titov said Monday.

“I believe that the investment cooperation will continue. The West needs our domestic market to sell its products, which are already made in Russia: vehicles, TV sets, etc.,” Titov told reporters.

He also expressed hope that the West’s anti-Russian sanctions would not be harsh.

“Russia is the world’s number one [country] for energy resources supplies … I think there could be no talk today of major economic sanctions,” Titov said.

Leaders of the G7 group of nations accused Russia Saturday of failing to follow through on the Geneva accords, agreed to earlier this month that aimed to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine.

The G7 members have threatened Moscow with tougher sanctions over its role in events in Ukraine.

Moscow has criticized Washington for using the “language of sanctions” against it, saying such moves were counterproductive."
