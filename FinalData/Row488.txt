"MOSCOW, April 28, 22:45 /ITAR-TASS/. Western countries have no grounds to accuse Russia of failing to implement the Geneva statement of April 17 on de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday, April 28, following a G7 statement on April 26.

“While groundlessly accusing Russia of non-compliance with the Geneva statement of April 17, 2014, Western partners state that Ukraine has allegedly taken positive measures,” the ministry said.

It expressed doubt that “an army operation with the use of Ukrainian troops and security services in the eastern regions of the country against their own people who disagree with the policy of the present Kiev regime” is “a positive measure”."
