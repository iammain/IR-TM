"Annual gas supplies to Ukraine will make 3.2 billion cubic metres from October 2014, an official of the Slovakian gas transportation company Eustream acquainted with the document told ITAR-TASS. In 2015 gas delivery may reach 10 billion cubic metres, a source acquainted with current situation.

The countries also agreed to ponder possible reverse supply through a gas transit pipe along which Russian gas is being pumped to Europe.

Use of this pipeline for reverse supply is impossible without Russian gas giant Gazprom’s agreement, because this contradicts Eustream contract liabilities, EU Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger noted earlier.

Ukraine’s annual gas consumption makes more than 50 billion cubic metres."
