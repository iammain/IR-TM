"I respect Mr.Churkin and Russia, but US doesn't give us peace in Canada. 
They can kill you here by denying medical care.
I live in Calgary. My daughter needed help with her immune system. The doctor lied and called it lice. Then wrote a note saying, oooops, not lice. So sorry. No immunologist. No meds.
The tumors on my foot are pressing on nerves up my leg, hard to walk.  Same doc was not too concerned. No referral to Ortho surgeon.
No health care, no life. And that is Canada now.
So of course the US is trying to kill Russians in Ukraine by giving weapons to Kiev coup leaders."
