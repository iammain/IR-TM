"MOSCOW, May 04 /ITAR-TASS/. Russia is indignant that the Kiev regime does not fulfil the February 21 accord and the April 17 Geneva statement, Russian State Secretary and Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin told Itar-Tass on Sunday.

“We are indignant that the Kiev regime had not fulfilled the February 21 accord and the April 17 Geneva statement yet,” the Russian state secretary said, noting that “Punitive actions continue in south-eastern Ukraine. Radical elements are acting absolutely impermissibly in the south.” “The tragedy in the city of Odessa [the Ukrainian Black Sea port city] where tens of young people died shocked the whole world,” Karasin noted, adding that “We mourn for them. We offer condolences to the families of those killed in the cities of Odessa, Slavyansk and Kramatorsk.

“We believe that immediate international measures of impact on the Kiev regime are needed to put an end to a criminal policy,” he said, adding that “All our actions are aimed at this. The Russian president and the country’s foreign minister are keeping in constant contact with all international partners, are discussing tragedies which are happening on Ukrainian soil and are thinking over how to cope with this difficult situation when current Kiev authorities take current situation in their homeland incompetently and irresponsibly.”

“Our efforts will be continued,” Karasin pledged, noting that “It is needed to attain all agreements previously reached to be fulfilled. None of them primarily refusal from use of force in their homeland is fulfilled."
