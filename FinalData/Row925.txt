"WASHINGTON, April 30, /ITAR-TASS/. NATO does not intend to give a direct military aid to Ukraine but, in view of the obtaining situation, it mulls over actions in support of countries that are members of the Alliance, French General Jean-Paul Palomeros, the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, told Itar-Tass on Tuesday in an interview.

NATO does not consider the provision of a direct military aid to Ukraine. The Alliance has no commitments to Ukraine in this respect, and this is evident, he said. At the same time, upon pointing out fruitful cooperation with Ukraine, General Palomeros said It is never too early to begin to support one's partners, implying the rendering of assistance in the training of armed forces and consultations. At the same time, Palomeros emphasized that it is necessary to give support to NATO members. In so doing, he said, One must show flexibility and mobility in this respect.

This refers to the possibility of properly distributing efforts depending on the actual situation and working out respective packages of measures, General Palomeros explained."
