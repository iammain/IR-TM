"MOSCOW, May 01. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin is against quick introduction of electric power social consumption norms.

“The experiment should be conducted with utmost carefulness,” the Russian leader said at a meeting with trade union leaders.

In the view of Putin, it is necessary “once again to analyze what happens in reality.”

“And in reality, unfortunately, there is a hidden or even open rising of tariff rates,” the president said. Therefore, he noted, “there should be no hurry with the expansion of the experiment.”

The constituent entities have been given the right to decide themselves on the introduction of the social norm of electricity consumption or refuse form it no later than July 1, 2016.

Meanwhile, on April 22 the Russian government said that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a resolution, excluding the introduction of social consumption norm on water, as well as cancelling the introduction of social norms for heating and natural gas supply."
