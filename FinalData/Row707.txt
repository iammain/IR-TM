"BAKU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- French President Francois Hollande denounced referendums in eastern Ukraine as invalid, without any legitimacy and legality on Sunday. What is happening in Donetsk and Lugansk does not make any sense, said Hollande during his three-day official visit to South Caucasus region, which started with oil-rich Azerbaijan on Sunday.

Only the presidential vote on May 25 is legal, which names the country's president on legislation, the French president said.

Residents in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions went to vote on Sunday in referendums aimed at seeking independence from the country.

Hollande, accompanied by a number of representatives from French companies, was expected to have a meeting with his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev before heading to Armenia and Georgia. Hollande's visit aims to boost European Union's ties with the three countries. Economic relations with Azerbaijan is part of his main focus, since Europe is deeply involved in the Azerbaijan's energy sectors, a French diplomat said."
