"“We should do everything to ensure that all products used by the military and defense complex and necessary for it should be produced on our territory so that we do not depend on anyone in any of the areas of the army and fleet rearmament and their transition to new armament systems” Putin told a government meeting on state defense order fulfillment.

This policy will benefit the domestic industry, Putin said, urging readjustments in the work of domestic scientific schools and closer coordination with the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Putin said 20 trillion rubles ($570 billion) had been set aside for the army and fleet rearmament until 2020 and another 3 trillion rubles ($86 billion) for the upgrade of the military and defense sector."
