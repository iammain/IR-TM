"TOKYO, May 14. /ITAR-TASS/. Tokyo’s sanctions imposed on Russia will not hamper Speaker of the State Duma Sergei Naryshkin’s visit to Japan due in June, Secretary General of the Japanese Cabinet Yoshihide Suga told a news conference in the Japanese capital on Wednesday.

“Mr. Naryshkin is not on the list of people coming under the effect of sanctions, they do not spread on him,” the Japanese Cabinet’s general secretary said.

The State Duma speaker has visited Tokyo many times before to attend annual festivals of Russian culture in Japan. On May 13, he met in Moscow with Japanese parliament member and chairman of the Japan-Russia Society Kunio Hatoyama. At this meeting he confirmed his plans to visit Tokyo in June to attend the next festival of Russian culture.

Tokyo stated in late April that the country decided to suspend issue of entry visas to 23 Russian officials and other people over the current situation around Ukraine. The list was not made public."
