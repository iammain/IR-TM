"MINSK, May 05. /ITAR-TASS/. All countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) favor early stabilization of the situation in Ukraine, for peace and accord in the Ukrainian society, the chairman of the CIS Executive Committee, Sergei Lebedev, told reporters on Monday.

“Today, we discussed with the Belarussian president the developments in Ukraine with anxiety and concern. The situation is difficult. Ukraine is our traditional partner, irrespective of its CIS membership,” Lebedev said. Millions of ties connect Ukraine and other post-Soviet states, including economic, humanitarian, and family ties, he said.

Lebedev said stability in Ukraine was not only in the interests of the Ukrainian people, but in the interests of all CIS countries.

Ukraine gave up the CIS rotating chairmanship following Crimea’s accession to Russia and voiced plans to withdraw from the Commonwealth."
