"WASHINGTON, May 01 /ITAR-TASS/. Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde has warned about the risks of using economic sanctions amid the current situation in and around Ukraine.

Anything that undermines the economic situation in the country jeopardizes fulfillment of the program, she said answering a question by Itar-Tass.

She stressed along with it the objectives of the IMF’s anti-crisis program for Ukraine saying it aimed to improve the economic situation in the much-troubled country and all the parties concerned without exception should be interested in it.

The IMF does not engage in sanctions, it engages in the necessary reforming as it wants to improve the situation, Lagarde said.

In this context, she expressed the hope that the remaining litigious issues would be resolved through negotiations, adding that this concerned in an equal measure the prices for natural gas, which Ukraine imports from Russia.

The IMF loan facility includes the monies needed for paying these supplies up, she said."
