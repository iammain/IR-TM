"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Moscow court on Monday returned a theft case against opposition leader Alexei Navalny to prosecutors on Monday, Russian news agencies reported, handing a reprieve to the one of President Vladimir Putin's biggest critics.

The ruling means the second trial of the protest leader who is already serving a five-year suspended sentence will be put off at least until prosecutors remove flaws in their case.
