"UNITED NATIONS, May 3 (Itar-Tass) - The Russian delegation was shocked at the placidity of Western countries over the illegitimate Kiev leadership's actions with the use of force against residents in southeastern Ukraine, Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said.

Such an attitude of the West made Kiev sure of impunity for its actions, he noted."
