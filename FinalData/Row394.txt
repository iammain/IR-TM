"MOSCOW, April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. The West uses Ukraine as a pawn in its geopolitical game, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, speaking at a global university forum.

The US has tried to orchestrate a 'color revolution' in Ukraine. Few people have doubts that it is not only about the future of Ukraine. They try to use it (Ukraine) as a pawn in a geopolitical game, the foreign minister said.

Ukraine should not be a field of geopolitical stand-off, but a connecting link, Lavrov added.

“Not everybody has drawn conclusions from the Cold War. Despite political declarations pronounced at the highest level, there was no progress in creating a common space of security and stability in Europe,” the foreign minister said. “Our Western partners, the US in particular, try to act as if they won the Cold War and do not need to take Russia’s interests into account in their European policy,” Lavrov added.

Russia call for a collective decision on resolving the Ukrainian crisis. We used this approach in negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program, on the Syrian chemical weapons, Lavrov noted. We hope that such an approach will be used in resolving the Ukrainian crisis that will meet the interests of all Ukrainian people, the foreign minister stressed."
