"MOSCOW, May 20 (RIA Novosti) - US President Barack Obama could show more political tact in settling the relations with Russia as the current US policy is nullifying all cooperation efforts over the last few years of the “reset and is leading to a “cold war,” Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Tuesday.

“I believe that President Obama could show more political tact in discussing these issues, and a number of decisions taken by the United States’ administration disappoint me,” Medvedev said during an interview with Bloomberg.

“We are slowly but surely moving toward a second Cold War, which no one needs,” Medvedev added.

The relations between the two countries have lurched from the reset brokered by Premier Medvedev and President Obama in 2009 to the bitter standoff over the Ukrainian crisis in 2014.

Russia and America found themselves on opposite sides of the barricades following the February overthrow of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia sees the ouster as an illegitimate seizure of power, whereas the US, siding with the Kiev's interim authorities continues to condemn Russia’s stance on the crisis."
