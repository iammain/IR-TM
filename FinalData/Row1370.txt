"The Russian language and the Russian Orthodox Church were born in the territory of modern Ukraine and the two countries do not consider each other foreigners, the minister said in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday, May 14.

He said Moscow respects the results of the May 11 referendums in the eastern Ukrainian Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Lavrov believes that all Ukrainian regions, eastern and western, should be represented at the talks, with the exception of those whose hands are tainted with blood."
