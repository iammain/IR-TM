"MOSCOW, May 20 (RIA Novosti) – China’s Defense Ministry condemned Washington for “hypocrisy and double standards” after the US Department of Justice on Monday charged five officials from the Chinese military establishment with economic cyber espionage, AFP reported Tuesday.

“From WikiLeaks to the Snowden case, US hypocrisy and double standards regarding the issue of cyber-security have long been abundantly clear, Defense Ministry’s statement reads.

Chinese Foreign Ministry had also said the US grand jury indictment was “made up” and would “damage Sino-American cooperation and mutual trust”. Beijing had called for “immediate rectification” as China is “a staunch defender of network security.”

The US Justice Department on Monday charged five officials from the Chinese military establishment with economic cyber espionage, accusing them of stealing trade secrets of six US companies in the fields of nuclear and solar power and metallurgy, including Alcoa and Westinghouse Electric. This became the first ever case of the US pressing criminal charges against Chinese officials over hacking.

The US government earlier stated that it would consider the possibility of trade sanctions against China if there is evidence that cyber attacks on US companies and institutions are carried out with the official support of Beijing. Chinese authorities argue that the country regularly falls victim to hacker attacks itself, with some traces of these attacks pointing to the US.

Earlier in February 2013 American company Mandiant, specializing in cyber security, issued a report, claiming that Chinese People’s Liberation Army had launched hacker attacks on American entities."
