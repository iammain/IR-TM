"KIEV, April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. Kiev-appointed Governor of the eastern Donetsk Region Sergei Taruta and Donetsk Mayor Alexander Lukyanchenko have proposed holding a nationwide referendum on broader powers for regions on May 25.

Taruta also suggested holding a nationwide referendum on the status of the Russian language.

Lukyanchenko said a referendum would help to ease the socio-political tensions in the South-East of Ukraine.

At an extraordinary congress of the Party of Regions in Donetsk on April 16, its delegates demanded that the Kiev authorities hold a referendum on a broader range of issues. They insisted that Russian be given the status of official language, the powers of the central government and the local authorities be separated, direct general elections to local bodies be held, regional administrations be dissolved, the budget powers of the central government and the local authorities be clearly delimited, and regions be given autonomy in addressing humanitarian issues and in the field of education."
