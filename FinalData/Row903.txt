"The service barely reacted to the demands of the Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor in connection with fake accounts and libel. In particular, Russia accused Twitter of violating the law protecting personal data and limiting banned information on the web, said Gattarov.

Twitter could be blocked in the whole of Russia, Deputy Head of Roskomnadzor Maxim Ksenzov told the Izvestia daily on Friday as “persisting in not fulfilling our demands” Tiwtter specially created the conditions which make blocking of the service in Russia “almost inevitable”, he said.

Media watchdog Roskomnadzor’s press secretary Vadim Ampelonsky confirmed that Twitter can be blocked in Russia.

Twitter systematically refused to fulfil Roskomnadzor’s and Prosecutor General’s demands that the service deletes extremist content, Ampelonsky said adding the company’s “unconstructive position” rendered blocking of Twitter inevitable.

The last demand was satisfied on February 26, when the service removed a Russian-language account disseminating banned information about Syria, including photos of corpses and executions. Other demands were ignored, said Ampelonsky."
