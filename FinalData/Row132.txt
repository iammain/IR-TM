"MI5 hiring: British Secret Service looking for intel experts on Russia

The UK’s MI5 has decided to beef up its team with more experts on Russia amid the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine. It is now hiring Russian intelligence analysts to monitor intercepted phone calls and emails.


  According to the Times’ David Leppard, the British Secret Service
  is advertising the positions in this week’s newspapers. It can
  also be easily found on MI5’s official website.



  Successful applicants will be tasked with listening to telephone
  calls in Russian, working with written documents “intercepted
  under warrant” and providing expert support to investigative
  officers.



  The fluent Russian speakers will be giving “clear analysis in
  a variety of ways” that, MI5 says, will “help safeguard
  national security.”

“Your work will enable us to take a well-informed view of
  potential threats to national security, including terrorism and
  espionage,” the job description reads.



  MI5’s Russian intelligence analysts will be also cooperating with
  the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6) and the Government
  Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).



  Those who get the job will be paid ?30,000 ($50,000) a year.



  Aside from fluent Russian, British citizenship or residency is
  also a must.



  MI5’s recruitment comes amid growing tensions between the West
  and Russia over the political crisis in Ukraine, a former
  republic of the Soviet Union. While the two sides agree on the
  necessity of de-escalation of the situation in Ukraine, there is
  still no agreement on approaches.



  While the West is accusing Moscow of attempts to undermine
  sovereignty of the country, Russia is blaming the US and its
  European allies for fueling Maidan protests and supporting the
  coup-appointed Kiev government."
