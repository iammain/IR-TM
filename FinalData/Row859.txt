"The third round of sanctions can touch individuals and companies in several sectors of the economy. One option suggests a ban on the export of high-tech energy technologies for Russian companies that trouble Russia's attempts to go beyond the traditional hydrocarbon production and enter new export markets. US may impose sanctions similar to the recent ban on the export of military technologies.

Financial Times notes that the plans for the introduction of new sanctions may meet with opposition from Italy, which is a member of the G7."
