German Sunday newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported May 4 the CIA and the FBI were providing consultations to the government in Kiev at the US Administration’s instruction.

The publication said the consultations were aimed to help Kiev suppress protests in the country’s eastern regions and to build up a viable security structure.

In addition, the report assured that neither CIA nor FBI consultants were involved in combat actions in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and all their activity was restricted to the capital."
