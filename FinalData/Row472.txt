"KIEV, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. A punitive operation in eastern Ukraine will continue regardless of decisions that federalization supporters will make, including on a referendum on May 11, secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Andriy Parubiy told a media briefing on Thursday.

“We will continue the operation. We are sure that it will be held successfully and will bring an expected effect,” he added.

On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was asking Ukrainian federalization supporters to postpone the referendum to a later date."
