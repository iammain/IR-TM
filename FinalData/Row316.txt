"KIEV, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. A bill banning entry to Ukraine for certain Russian citizens has been registered in Ukraine’s parliament, the parliamentary press service reported on Thursday.

The document was initiated by off-faction lawmaker Viktor Baloga. The bill has been referred to relevant committees. The text of the bill is not yet available.

Meanwhile, the United Center Party, of which Baloga is the leader, said on Thursday that the bill provides for an entry ban for Russian lawmakers. “The document recommends the Security Service of Ukraine not to allow lawmakers from Russia’s Federation Council and State Duma, who voted in favor of allowing the Russian president to use the Russian army in Ukraine’s territory and approved Crimea’s accession Russia, to enter our state,” the party said in a release."
