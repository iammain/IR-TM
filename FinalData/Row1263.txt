"MOSCOW, May 01. /ITAR-TASS/. Kiev’s plans to conduct some national poll on May 25 are a phoney act, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, May 1.

“We have noted the remarks made by ‘acting Prime Minister of Ukraine’ Arseny Yatsenyuk, who said that some national poll should be held on May 25, which will concern particularly ‘decentralisation of power’. He also said that the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine had approved ‘its own vision for the regional reform’ and separately stated that the government of the country ‘is prepared to give additional guarantees to the Russian-speaking population and the languages of other ethnic minorities in the relevant territory. He did not specify what ‘additional guarantees’ mean”, the ministry said.

The Kiev authorities’ plans detached from real life “cause nothing but surprise” in Moscow, it said. “Does Kiev really think that in the remaining days until May 25, 2014 it can conduct a serious discussion in society and all regions of Ukraine on critical issues concerning the future state system in the country? These statements appear to be especially cynical against amid Kiev’s ongoing army operation against its own people”, the ministry said.

“Instead of starting a national discussion with all political forces and all regions in the country on how to resolve the deepest political and socioeconomic crisis, the Kiev authorities are busy organising phoney actions. This won’t lead to anything else but deeper crisis in the country”, the ministry added."
