"“We still have questions,” Putin said on Tuesday. “But I’d agree with my colleagues that we can always jointly work on them to find compromise solutions.

The Russian president expressed confidence the treaty will be another step towards closer cooperation between the three countries. “It will make it possible to boost competitive edge of our economies, to attract domestic and foreign investors,” Putin said. “This market embracing 170 million people may become still more attractive.”

Putin noted that much had been done when the treaty was being drafted. He thanked experts and prime ministers from the three countries. Special thanks were addressed to President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. “He was among the father founders, the initiator and the author of this idea,” he added."
