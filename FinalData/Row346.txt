"KIEV, May 11, 11:46 /ITAR-TASS/. The turnout at a referendum over self-determination in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Lugansk “has made around 22%” as of 11am Moscow time (8am BST), representative of the Lugansk referendum press centre Vasily Nikitin told Itar-Tass on Sunday.

Meanwhile, serious problems are arising over security, he said. “There are many problems,” he noted, adding that “Armed people, a certain “national guard’ are intimidating people in a district and are moving military hardware from one settlement to another.”

Polling stations will be open until 10pm local time (8pm BST) on Sunday. Voting results will be announced on Monday, May 12."
