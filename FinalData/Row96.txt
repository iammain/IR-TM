"Peskov responded to remarks by the German leader, who regretted Russia’s plans for a parade in Crimea celebrating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.

Earlier, Angela Merkel expressed a view that, although Victory Day on May 9 was an important date for Russia to commemorate the defeat of Hitler's Nazis, the current conflict in Ukraine would make a parade inappropriate.

Peskov commented on the German chancellor’s statement in an interview to Ekho Moskvy (Echo Moscow) radio. Affairs in Ukraine should have no relevance to Crimea, Peskov said, adding that the Russian leadership shared the German chancellor’s concerns over conflict in Ukraine.

“We are highly concerned over the latest developments in Ukraine,” Peskov said, adding: “We are continuing our dialogue.”"
