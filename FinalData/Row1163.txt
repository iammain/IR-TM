"KIEV, April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. The trade volume between Russia and Ukraine has declined by a quarter in the first two months this year, Ukrainian Economic Development and Trade Minister Pavel Sheremet told a briefing on Thursday.

“We believe it is serious, but it is not our fault,” he said. “We realize trade is mutually advantageous and what is happening now is mutually disadvantageous.”

It is difficult to find an alternative to the Russian market, Sheremet notes. “There are other attractive markets. For example, China is the Country Number Two. But it must be won,” he said, suggesting more imitative should be taken by enterprises.

On Monday, the minister said Ukraine considered appealing to the World Trade Organization in connection with restrictions on supplies of Ukrainian goods to the Russian Federation."
