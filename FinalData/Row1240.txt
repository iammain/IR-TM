"MOSCOW, April 29. /ITAR-TASS/. Japan’s effort to exert pressure on Russia will not promote deescalation of tension in Ukraine, Russia's Foreign Ministry said.

Moscow is disappointed with Japan’s visa sanctions against several Russian citizens as it is counterproductive to speak a language of sanctions, the foreign ministry added.

“This awkward step is obviously taken under external pressure and runs counter to Tokyo’s statements on importance of developing the entire scope of relations with Russia, the ministry pointed out.

Japan’s decision to introduce visa sanctions on Russian citizens will not be left unanswered, the statement said."
