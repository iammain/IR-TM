"MOSCOW, May 5 (RIA Novosti) – Russia's Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) has called on the UN and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to help arrange talks between the warring parties in Ukraine, the council said Monday.

The council calls on intergovernmental structures and, primarily, the OSCE and the UN, to make every possible effort to organize talks between the warring parties. The council is ready to partner with the OSCE observer mission in this process, which is vital for Ukraine, Russia and all of Europe, the council said in a statement.

The Human Rights Council also called for lists to be published of all detainees captured and arrested on both sides, and their immediate release under the supervision of international observers. The Council also urged Ukrainian authorities to allow foreign humanitarian missions, including from Russia, access to the regions affected by violence in order to provide medical and psychological assistance to victims.

On Friday, Ukraine saw the bloodiest violence since the February overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych, with dozens killed in clashes across the country. The highest casualty toll was reported in the southern city of Odessa, where 46 people died and over 200 were injured.

The Russian Foreign Ministry called the Odessa tragedy a result of criminal irresponsibility of the Kiev leadership indulging insolent nationalist radicals, including Right Sector, who are staging a campaign of physical terror against supporters of federalization and real constitutional changes in the Ukrainian society."
