"BELFAST, May 19 (RIA Novosti), Mark Hirst – Gerry Adams, the President of Sinn Fein – the political party affiliated to the IRA - is to travel to Washington DC next week to hold talks with the US Department of State and other political leaders over fears the Anglo-Irish peace process is slipping into crisis.

In a statement Adams, who is a member of the Irish Parliament, D?il ?ireann, blamed the British Government for failing to progress the peace-agreement, known as the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the 35 year conflict.

“The peace process is facing some turbulence at this time as a result of the failure of the British government to deal with outstanding issues arising from the Good Friday Agreement,” Adams said.

Adams accused the British Government of refusing to back compromise proposals drawn up by US diplomat Dr Richard Haass to deal with so-called “legacy cases” arising from the conflict which claimed over 3,500 lives.

“The negative stance of the British government is also encouraging the Unionist parties not to engage fully in the political process and institutions,” Adams added.

“The peace process cannot be allowed to meander. The road has too many pitfalls,” Adams said. “There are too many powerful elements on the fringes of nationalism, within unionism and the British system who want to derail the process and build obstacles to it.”

Adams, who was arrested and questioned two weeks ago by the Police Service of Northern Ireland in connection to the 1972 murder of Jean McConville added that his visit to the US was an effort to highlight the problems in the peace process and “to chart a way through these dangers.”

My visit to Washington next week is to highlight these issues and concerns and to seek a renewed focus and support for the peace process and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement,” Adams added."
