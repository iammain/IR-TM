"MOSCOW, April 29. /ITAR-TASS/. Imposition of EU sanctions on Russia shows Brussels’ full misinterpretation of the current situation in Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.

“If someone in Brussels hopes to stabilize the situation in Ukraine this way, this is an obvious evidence of full misinterpretation of domestic political situation in that country and direct invitation to local neo-Nazis to continue their outrage and lynch civilians in south-eastern Ukraine,” the ministry said.

A new portion of sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian citizens announced by the European Union cannot but cause repulsion, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.

A new installment of sanctions imposed by the EU on Russian and Ukrainian citizens cannot but cause repulsion, the ministry's commentary said. Instead of making the Kiev clique take seats at a conference table together with the southeastern regions and discuss the future structure of the country, our partners have taken lead from Washington and are making ever more unfriendly gestures towards Russia, the foreign ministry added."
