"WARSAW, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. Poland should accelerate the introduction of euro currency amid the events in Ukraine, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told the parliament’s lower house in his annual address about the country’s foreign policy on Thursday.

“The events in Ukraine should prompt us to integrate with the Eurozone as soon as possible,” he said. Decision on possible introduction of the common European currency will be of not only economic and financial but also political importance, Sikorski stressed.

The euro zone is based on the principle “one for all, all for one”, since “serious threats to one state automatically imply changes for all of the member countries”.

“In the present complicated international situation, it is in our best interests to create such an interconnection between Poland and other European countries,” the foreign minister added.

Poland’s Government is going to discuss euro introduction after the parliamentary and presidential election in 2015. If the country implements all requirements and a positive decision is made, the republic will be able to join the euro zone in 2018."
