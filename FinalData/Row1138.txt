"GENEVA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia requested consultations with the European Union (EU) over the latter's regulations in energy sector, starting the first step in a dispute against EU to the World Trade Organization (WTO), announced the world trade watchdog here on Thursday.

The EU measures in question were called Third Energy Package, a legislation for an internal gas and electricity market which came into force in September 2009.

The package was aimed at further opening up the markets in the region by ownership unbundling, which requires the separation of companies' generation and sale operations from their transmission networks.

In Russia's complaint filed on Wednesday, a number of EU's measures in this sector, including those pertaining to production, supply and transmission of natural gas or electricity, and the alleged discriminatory certification requirements in relation to third countries, were inconsistent with its obligations and commitments under General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing measures and the Agreement Establishing the WTO, according to the organization.

Response to the request has to be given within 10 days and the member requested shall enter into consultations within a maximum of 30 days after the date of the receipt of the request.

The maximum period of consultations is 60 days after the reception of the request, unless both parties agree otherwise. If consultations fail to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel, according to the WTO."
