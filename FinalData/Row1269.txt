"WASHINGTON, May 06 /ITAR-TASS/. US sanctions against Russia imposed over the situation around Ukraine have so far not affected the plans of International Launch Services (ILS), a US-Russian joint venture making commercial launches of Proton carrier rockets from the Baikonur space center Russia leases from Kazakhstan, ILS spokeswoman Karen Monaghan said Tuesday.

Monaghan was commenting on restrictions on supplies to Russia of American military and dual-purpose products.

Some Russian and Crimean officials and companies have been subjected to sanctions by Western nations after Crimea’s incorporation by Russia in March, which the West and the de facto Kiev authorities refuse to recognize legal despite Moscow’s repeated statements that the Crimean referendum on secession was in line with the international law.

Russia has dismissed the threats of further sanctions against it saying such a language is counterproductive and will have a boomerang effect on Western nations.

Ukraine saw a coup in February after months of anti-government protests. New people were brought power amid riots as President Viktor Yanukovich had to leave Ukraine citing security concerns. Russia does not recognize the de facto Ukrainian authorities as legitimate ones.

Crimea, where most residents are Russians, held a referendum March 16 in which it overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and reunify with Russia. The accession deal with Moscow was signed March 18."
