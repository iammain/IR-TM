"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has imposed sanctions on Central African Republic's former president, Fran?§ois Boziz?©, and four other men linked to violence and human rights abuses in the country, the White House said on Tuesday.

The country has been racked by sectarian violence for a year after Seleka rebels, who are mostly Muslim, seized power, and anti-balaka militias, mainly Christian, fought back.

Thousands have been killed and about a million people displaced. More than 2.5 million people - half the country's population - need humanitarian aid, the White House said.

Growing attacks perpetrated by both Muslim and Christian militias have brought CAR to a crisis of disastrous proportions, the White House said in a statement.

The sanctions, which freeze assets and ban travel for the individuals named, followed U.N. Security Council sanctions on Friday on Boziz?©, who is an anti-balaka supporter, Nourredine Adam, a Seleka general and a former minister of public security, and Levy Yakete, an anti-balaka leader.

Washington also imposed sanctions on Michel Djotodia, former transitional president of the Central African Republic and leader of the Seleka rebellion, and Abdoulaye Miskine, leader of an ex-Seleka rebel group called the Democratic Front of the Central African Republic People, the White House said.
