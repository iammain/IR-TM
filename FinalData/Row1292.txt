"KIEV, May 11, /ITAR-TASS/. Ukrainian law enforcement agencies continue a punitive operation in the south-eastern Ukrainian cities of Krasny Liman, Slavyansk and Kramatorsk on Sunday, the Ukrainian presidential press service cited interim presidential chief-of-staff Sergey Pashinsky as saying at a media briefing at the Ukrainian crisis centre.

“Eight operational groups have destroyed several checkpoints” and eliminated a group of militiamen in the punitive operation, he said. He stated that this had been a response to their attempt “to pass to active actions overnight to Sunday.”

The punitive operation “goes on as scheduled” in these settlements, he added."
