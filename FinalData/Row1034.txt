"KIEV, May 15 /ITAR-TASS/. A national roundtable on the settlement of the crisis in the South-East of Ukraine will be held in Donetsk or Kharkov in the next few days, former President Leonid Kravchuk said on Thursday, May 15.

“A roundtable will be held shortly, maybe even on Saturday, in the east either in Donetsk or Kharkov. We will think which is best,” Kravchuk, who is one of the moderators of the forum, told local television.

In his opinion, the forum will “discuss concrete documents, specifically a new regional policy”.

Kravchuk stressed that only registered public organisations should attend the national roundtable. “Those self-proclaimed or self-created can submit their proposals through official organisations,” he said."
