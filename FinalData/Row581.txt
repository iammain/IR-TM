"KIEV, May 08. /ITAR-TASS/. The 100 million U.S. dollars the United States has promised to give Ukraine in military aid will not be invested in the Ukrainian defence industry but “will be used to escalate aggression and provoke new conflicts and confrontation in the country”, Viktor Medvedchuk, leader of the Ukrainian Choice public movement, said on Thursday, May 8.

“This is the real U.S. goal,” the Ukrainian National News quoted him as saying.

Medvedchuk believes the conclusion that “the United States is ready to finance a new stage of confrontation and aggression in Ukraine” follows from the statements made by “influential representatives of the ‘party of war’ in the U.S. - Senator John McCain and former presidential adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski”. “The politicians are strongly advising [U.S. President] Barack Obama to arm Ukraine so that it could ‘fight’ and ‘counteract’ more confidently,” he said.

A bill submitted to the U.S. Congress on April 30 authorises supplies of anti-tank weapons and air defence systems to Ukraine and allows the president to provide direct military assistance to Ukraine in the amount of 100 million U.S. dollars in 2014."
