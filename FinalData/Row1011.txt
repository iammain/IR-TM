"WASHINGTON, May 15 (RIA Novosti) – In a speech to the Atlantic Council, the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has reiterated that the involvement of the United States military in regions bordering Russia is a NATO issue.

“Militarily, the issue in Eastern Europe needs to be about NATO. It is the NATO alliance which should be, and is, the most concerned. So our efforts, militarily, in Eastern Europe have been to reassure our allies that our article 5 responsibilities are clear to us,” Gen. Martin Dempsey said Wednesday.

In an earlier interview with the Defense One website, Gen. Dempsey noted that the crisis in Ukraine is NATO’s opportunity to reassess the mission of the alliance.

“My personal view is that this is a moment for NATO to decide what it intends to be in the future,” he said, adding that NATO has showed its relevance in the 13 year effort in Afghanistan, proving “the alliance was willing to look beyond its own borders.”

“Now I think the crisis in Ukraine is causing NATO to look back to its own backyard, and forcing it to decide whether it still has the capability and capacity to reassure its member states – especially those Eastern countries that embraced NATO as it enlarged in the 1990s – that the alliance remains credible,” Dempsey concluded.

US General Philip Breedlove, the commander of NATO forces in Europe, said that in the light of the aggravation of the situation in Ukraine, NATO member countries may consider permanently stationing troops in Eastern Europe. Currently, NATO troops are present in the region only for short-term rotations.

Russian Ambassador to NATO Alexander Grushko suggested that the alliance “is trying to use to its maximum the crisis in Ukraine in order to prove its relevance in the current security environment.”"
