"UNITED NATIONS, May 05 /ITAR-TASS/. U.N. Under-Secretary-General Jeffrey Feltman will arrive in Moscow within several hours for consultations on Ukraine, an informed source in the United Nations told ITAR-TASS on Monday, May 5.

He said Feltman had wound up his mission in Cyprus and was on his way to Moscow. In Moscow, Feltman will hold meetings with Russian officials.

On May 7-8, he is planning to visit Kiev.

Last week, he said that during his talks in Moscow and Kiev he would seek to convey U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s call for restraint and immediate resumption of dialogue.

Ban told Agence France Presse earlier on May 5 that he was “ready to play a role” in the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis.

He said he was maintaining contact with all sides involved - Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the United States - and urged all sides to resolve the issue peacefully.

His deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said Ban’s mediation would be possible only if the sides concerned wished so."
