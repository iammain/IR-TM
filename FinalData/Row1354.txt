"BRUSSELS, May 12 (RIA Novosti) – The chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has called for decentralization and minority rights in the country to be the focus of the anticipated nationwide reconciliation dialogue.

“Broad debate about issues such as decentralization and the status of the Russian language is indispensable for an inclusive, transparent, and accountable constitutional process,” said Didier Burkhalter, who also serves as Switzerland's foreign minister and president.

Burkhalter said German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, who was nominated as co-moderator for the Ukrainian national dialogue, will depart for Ukraine on Tuesday.

Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the Washington-backed government in Kiev of blocking the OSCE-brokered roadmap on the Ukrainian crisis by refusing “to talk to its own people.”

Lavrov earlier called for equitable dialogue between the authorities in Kiev and pro-federalization activists in southeastern Ukraine with mediation by the OSCE.

French Ambassador to Russia Jean-Maurice Ripert earlier told RIA Novosti the OSCE had been debating a package of measures to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine.

He said the organization regarded the upcoming presidential election on May 25 and the subsequent creation of a lawful government in Ukraine as one of the key steps to promote peace in the country.

An early presidential election was scheduled in Ukraine on May 25 after President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted late February following mass rallies."
