"Yaroshenko had been questioned at the US prison’s isolation ward for four hours, the lawyer of the jailed Russian pilot said.

“If these facts are confirmed and if he was brought to the isolation ward these actions cannot be justified at all,” the diplomat said, noting that “They put the life and health of Konstantin Yaroshenko to additional risk. The situation causes indignation.”

“This alarming information is even hard to comment taking into account the health of our citizen,” Dolgov said, noting that “We asked and ask for Russian doctors jointly with U.S. doctors to be permitted to visit Yaroshenko. The proper medical aid was not given to the Russian,” the Foreign Ministry’s envoy stated.

“Moscow continues to seek for all rights of the Russian citizen observed,” Dolgov pledged, adding that “We hope that explanations will be given over this incident and mostly important is that such incidents should not recur.

Dolgov noted that Moscow was following actions of the Russian convict’s lawyer. “The lawyer has filed one more appeal to resume the trial,” the Foreign Ministry’s envoy said.

“Mostly important is to prevent Konstantin Yaroshenko’s health from worsening,” the diplomat said, adding that “Still, all our arguments are misunderstood."
