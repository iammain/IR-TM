"BRUSSELS, May 12 (RIA Novosti) – Switzerland, the chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), believes there is no pressing need to hold a second Geneva conference on settling the crisis in Ukraine.

“If you speak of a conference, it may take place in Geneva or somewhere else. It is important for a conference to take into account the result. Currently, it is not important to take into consideration the result, it is important to act. We do not need a conference now,” OSCE Chair Didier Burkhalter told journalists Monday after talks with EU foreign ministers.

He said the conference would be useful if “there is necessity to switch to the next stage.”

The first round of the Geneva talks on the Ukrainian situations attended by top diplomats from Russia, the United States, the European Union and Ukraine took place on April 17. The four-party meeting resulted in a number of agreements that urged the coup-imposed regime and its opposition in Ukraine to refrain from violence, extremism and provocations, to disarm militants and launch a national dialogue on constitutional reform.

Despite promises to lay down arms, the Kiev authorities launched a large-scale military operation in the southeastern regions of Ukraine last month to crack down on federalization supporters.

Moscow repeatedly condemned the move, calling it an extremely dangerous development of events.

Earlier on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also confirmed there were no plans to renew talks on the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis, adding that a new round of talks would not be productive."
