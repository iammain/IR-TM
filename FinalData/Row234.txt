"MOSCOW, April 30 (RIA Novosti) – Russian President Vladimir Putin has discussed in a phone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi the situation in Ukraine and the necessity for all concerned parties to respect this month's Geneva agreement, the Kremlin said Wednesday.

“Both leaders have exchanged opinions on the situation in Ukraine and stressed, in particular, the necessity for all parties to respect Geneva commitments of April 17,” the Kremlin press service said.

Putin and Renzi also discussed the current issues of Russian-Italian cooperation in various arenas, including energy.

On April 17 in Geneva, top diplomats from Russia, the United States, Europe and Ukraine agreed a number of measures aimed at the de-escalation of tensions in the crisis-hit country, including the disarmament of irregular militant groups and a dialogue on constitutional reforms.

Last week, Ukraine's acting President Oleksander Turchinov ordered security forces to resume a special operation in the country’s east to crack down on pro-federalization protests.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that despite the Geneva agreement calling for the end of violence and total rejection of extremism, the Right Sector movement continues to stage its provocations in Ukraine, including targeting Ukrainians."
