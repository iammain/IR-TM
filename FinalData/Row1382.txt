"BERLIN, May 12. /ITAR-TASS/. Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz says channels should remain open for negotiations with Russia in seeking diplomatic resolution of the Ukraine crisis.

“It seems necessary to provide platforms for dialogue (with Russia on Ukraine),” Kurz told Germany’s daily Die Welt (The World) ahead of a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.

Austria “will in no way recognize” outcomes of the referendums on self-determination in east Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Kurz said."
