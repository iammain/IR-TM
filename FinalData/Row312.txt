"MOSCOW, April 29. /ITAR-TASS/. Signs of a humanitarian disaster in Ukraine are becoming more noticeable, and the situation is alarming, head of the Federal Migration Service Konstantin Romodanovsky said on Tuesday.

“When all signs (of deteriorating situation in Ukraine) have emerged, I said that there are some signs of a humanitarian disaster. They are becoming more and more noticeable. Our concerns do not wane,” he said at a meeting of the Federation Council upper house of parliament.

At the same time, less than 1% of Russia’s Crimea residents refused to receive Russian citizenship, Romodanovsky said.

“Less than 1% of Crimean residents do not want to receive Russian passports. All questions will be settled,” he noted."
