"MOSCOW, May 5 (RIA Novosti) – The continuation of lawlessness in Ukraine may lead to the escalation of conflicts throughout Europe, according to a report by the Russian Foreign Ministry published on the Kremlin’s website Monday.

“We are convinced that, in case of the continuation of lawlessness in Ukraine, the situation there may escalate into a serious threat to regional peace and security, and lead to further growth of cross-national and interethnic contradictions and conflicts in Ukraine and throughout Europe,” the Russian Foreign Ministry’s said in its “White Book.”

“We hope, that finally, this will be realized by competent international structures, that must in the framework of their mandates contribute to the solution for issues of conducting objective and non-politicized investigation of numerous human rights violations, as well as the principle of law rule in Ukraine,” the ministry said.

The report by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs compiled in a single document the most heinous human rights violations perpetrated during the crisis in Ukraine. The report was submitted to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday.

The Foreign Ministry stressed that the collection of facts, covering the period from November 2013 to March 2014, “shows the grossest violations of the fundamental international principles and norms in the area of human rights committed by the monopolizing protesters of Eurmaidan and its radical nationalists, and sometimes with the direct promotion of the United States and the European Union, which confirms that these occurrences had a massive character.”

On Monday, the Russian Presidential Human Rights Council also called on the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to pressure Ukraine into providing foreign humanitarian missions access to the regions affected by violence in order to provide medical and psychological assistance to victims.

The OSCE has echoed Moscow’s concerns over the human rights situation in Ukraine, criticizing country’s authorities for banning journalists from entering its territory and other widespread infringements on press freedom.

The rights report comes as Ukraine has entered the third day of mourning for 46 victims of clashes in Odessa on Friday between a gang of football fans and nationalistic Right Sector members, who arrived to the southern port city on the Black Sea from Kiev and elsewhere in the country."
