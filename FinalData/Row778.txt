"MOSCOW, May 3 (Itar-Tass) - Kerry's refusal to discuss in a telephone talk with Lavrov the situation in southeast Ukraine indicated the irresponsible approach of the United States, a Russian Foreign Ministry source said.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry asked for a telephone talk with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Syria, but when the U.S. side knew that Russia proposed to include the Ukrainian issue, Washington postponed the talk, the source said.

Such an approach clearly indicates that the American colleagues are not interested to look for a way out of the explosive situation fraught with unpredictable consequences and actually play into the hands of the current leadership in Kiev, the diplomat noted."
