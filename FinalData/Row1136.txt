"SIMFEROPOL, May 01, /ITAR-TASS/. The Ukrainian army offensive against regions controlled by militia in the South-East of the country will become the last attack of the present Kiev authorities, Crimea’s acting Head Sergei Aksyonov and Crimean State Council (parliament) Chairman Vladimir Konstantinov said on Thursday, May 1, commenting on media reports about a possible resumption of the army operation in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.

“The crooks in Kiev do not understand that everything they are doing will boomerang on them personally. A war against one’s own people has never done any good. We think they must be put on trial,” Aksyonov said, adding, “At any rate, history will make its own assessment of these villains who are sending troops against their own people.”

In his opinion, a resumption of the army operation will produce a result opposite to that expected by Kiev. “They still do not understand that all this will bring about resistance ten times stronger than now. The killing of peaceful people must not be forgiven no matter what goals are pursued. They must come to their senses,” Aksyonov said.

“We express our support to the people of the South-East of Ukraine who are legitimately fighting for their rights and freedoms,” he said.

Konstantinov echoed him by saying that a resumption of the army operation in the south-eastern regions of Ukraine “will be the last attack of the Kiev authorities. They touch one person and get a response ten times bigger.”

He believes that Kiev is creating a situation “which cannot last forever”. “The people who have come to power in Kiev are inadequate. I won’t be surprised if they proclaim Hitler their honorary leader tomorrow. I think that sooner or later this Nazi orgy will have to be stopped so that it does not bring disgrace upon the Russian world before the eyes of the whole planet,” Konstantinov said."
