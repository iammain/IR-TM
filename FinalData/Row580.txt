"MOSCOW, April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. The Russian Foreign Ministry urged the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and international rights organizations to condemn in the strongest possible terms violations of human rights in Ukraine and to press for an end to political repressions in the country.

Moscow is also seriously worried by reports about the construction of large temporary detention centers for thousands of persons in Ukraine, which remind of Nazi concentration camps, the ministry said.

The ministry voiced deep concern about the appalling arrests of public activists in the south-east of Ukraine and called for an immediate release of political prisoners of the Kiev regime.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia calls for the immediate release of (Donetsk Region people’s governor) Pavel Gubarev and other political prisoners of the Kiev regime,” it said.

“We are seriously concerned about the condition of Pavel Gubarev elected ‘a people’s governor’ of Donetsk,” the ministry said, adding that Gubarev had been abducted, charged with organising mass unrests and attempting to divide Ukraine, he had been tortured and was now on an open-ended hunger strike”.

“Pavel Gubarev is not the only political prisoner of the Kiev regime. Mass media reports give us reason to speak about the start of a ‘witch hunt’, mass prosecution of dissidents and political repressions and persecutions against those who dare disagree with the power of Maidan (general reference to mass protests in Kiev’s Independence Square known as Maidan and the coup that brought its leaders to power),” the ministry said."
