"Gennady Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv, was shot in the back Monday and is reportedly fighting for his life.

Kernes has a colorful presence on social media. On Twitter, he follows only two accounts, ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych's official account and Mikhail Dobkin, the former governor of the region who is running for president. He recently aligned himself with the new Ukrainian government, turning away from Yanukovych.

Earlier this year, a commenter on an Instagram photo of him with two dogs criticized his response to a fire in Kharkiv, and Kernes's reply to him was profane, ungrammatical and unpunctuated. One of his favorite photo subjects for social media appears to be him exercising. He's posted videos on Facebook of him running and riding bikes.

Here's Kernes congratulating a local student and more:
