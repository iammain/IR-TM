"KIEV, April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. People wearing masks and armed with bats, chains and nonlethal guns attacked participants in a many-thousands-strong antifascist march in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, chanting nationalistic slogans along with it, local media said.

Some of the participants in the march were injured.

Several dozen ultras attacked the moving column of people and started hurling stones at it. Reports also speak of a use of hand grenades. The protesters rebuffed the attackers and the latter made a getaway from the scene.

The marching column was shouting slogans like ‘Fascism Won’t Take Hold’, ‘Say No to Nazism’, ‘Russia, Russia’. Many participants sang patriotic songs in the Russian language.

Sunday, April 27, the ultras assaulted supporters of federalization of Ukraine in the northeastern city of Kharkov. Several dozen people received injuries."
