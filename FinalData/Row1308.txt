"MOSCOW, May 02. /ITAR-TASS/. Aeriflot, one of Russia’s biggest air carriers, will increase the number of flights to the Crimean capital city of Simferopol following the Ukrainian authorities’ ban on flight to Kharkov and Donetsk, the press service of the company said on Friday.

According to the press service, flights from Moscow to Kharkov and Donetsk were cancelled till May 5 inclusively over the lack of a permit to entre Ukraine’s air space.

“The aircraft that were originally meant to perform flights to Kharkov and Donetsk will be use to make additional flights to Simferopol,” the press service noted, adding that passengers having tickets to Kharkov and Donetsk would be paid the entire sum for the cancelled flights.

On Friday, Russia’s Air Transport Agency said that Ukraine’ aviation authorities had unilaterally banned Russian air companies to make flights to the eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Kharkov starting from Friday, May 2.

Russia’s air transport authority noted that this ban was an unprecedented violation of international air traffic agreements, encroached strongly on the rights of passengers and led to a humanitarian blockade of residents in south-eastern Ukrainian regions.

The Russian Air Transport Agency stressed that it would not take similar measures and would not close Russia’s air space for Ukrainian airlines."
