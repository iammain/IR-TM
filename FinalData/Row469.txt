"MOSCOW, May 20. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia envisions a plan of retaliatory measures against US sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said.

Of course, there is a plan of actions depending on how the situation will develop, Medvedev said in an interview with Bloomberg television. If we talk a bad scenario, despite the fact that we object to any sanctions, our package of retaliatory measures not only includes the measures towards a gradual improvement of the situation in our economy, but also the measures that might target certain states."
