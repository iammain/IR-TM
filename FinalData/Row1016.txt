"SANTIAGO, April 30 /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for direct dialogue between the Kiev authorities and the South-East of Ukraine.

“The role of Russia, the United States, Europe and all other interested states is not in covering for one of the Ukrainian sides but in helping to start a direct dialogue between those who have taken power in Kiev and those who disagree with them, primarily in the South-East of the country,” Lavrov said after talks with his Chilean colleague Heraldo Munoz on Wednesday, April 30.

He noted that “an attempt was made a couple of days ago to foster such a dialogue as an OSCE-brokered round table discussion between leaders in Kiev and the opposition. However the U.S. and EU officials blocked this initiative. That’s sad. But we will keep calling for full compliance with the Geneva Statement even though our partners are trying to shy away from its implementation,” the minister said."
