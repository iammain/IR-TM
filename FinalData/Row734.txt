"TBILISI, May 13. /ITAR-TASS/. The May 25 presidential elections in Ukraine are important both for Ukraine and Europe, visiting French President Francois Hollande said at a joint news conference with Georgian President Georgy Margvelashvili on Tuesday evening.

“Today, we have mobilized our efforts to ensure that Ukraine holds presidential elections and elects a new president who will be able to conduct a dialogue and will have a chance to carry out a constitutional reform,” President Hollande went on to say.

For his part, the Georgian president re-confirmed that Georgia supported Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and stressed the need to hold elections in all parts of Ukraine.

“Georgia supports presidential elections in Ukraine and does not recognize the results of the May 11 referendums held in Ukraine’s (eastern) regions,” Margvelashvili said."
