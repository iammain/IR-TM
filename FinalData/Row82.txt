"KIEV, May 13 (RIA Novosti) – The interim Kiev authorities have invited former Ukrainian Presidents Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma to participate in the first nationwide roundtable discussion on the settlement of the ongoing crisis in the country, the government's press service said Tuesday.

Ukraine’s coup-appointed acting Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk and government officials were also invited to take part in the talks scheduled to be held in Kiev on Wednesday, in addition to lawmakers, presidential hopefuls, local authorities, scientists, public figures and representatives of religious, business, social and international organizations.

OSCE Chairman and Swiss President Didier Burkhalter earlier proposed a roadmap, which included concrete steps necessary to de-escalate the crisis in the country, including reducing violence, disarmament as well as facilitating national dialogue and elections. The Swiss president announced a series of high-level roundtable discussions led by the OSCE which would bring together leading representatives from national government authorities, the Ukrainian parliament, and representatives from the regions.

Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the roadmap when meeting Burkhalter last Wednesday."
