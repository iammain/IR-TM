"MOSCOW, May 15. /ITAR-TASS/. Britain’s Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey has refused to go to Moscow to attend the 14th ministerial meeting of the International Energy Forum (IEF) due to the situation in Ukraine.

Representatives of several foreign countries did not arrive in Moscow because “some of them have to resolve internal pressing issues. The others take part in the EU ministerial session in Athens”, IEF Secretary-General Aldo Flores-Quiroga said on Thursday.

However, he said, “There are those who will not attend the forum because of the situation in Ukraine”.

“For example, the British secretary for energy sent a letter to the (Russian) Minister Alexander Novak. He explained to us that Britain would not take part in the ministerial meeting due to the events in Ukraine,” Flores-Quiroga said.

In the meantime, the British official said his country upheld the IEF and thanked all member-states for the support."
