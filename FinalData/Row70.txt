"KIEV, April 27. /ITAR-TASS/. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has refuted allegations of Ukraine’s parliament-appointed Foreign Minister Andrei Deshchitsa that OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier was arriving in Kiev later on Sunday.

The OSCE press service told Itar-Tass that the organization’s secretary general was not coming to Kiev.

Earlier on Sunday, Deshchitsa said that Lamberto Zannier would come to Kiev late on Sunday. “The situation over the release of OSCE observers [in Slavyansk] remains difficult,” he said. “I am returning to Kiev. OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier is coming to Kiev in the evening too.”

Also on Sunday, members of the group of international military observers from OSCE took part in a news conference in Slavyansk. One of them said the observers were not captives but “guests of Mayor Ponomarev.”

On Friday, April 25, supporters of federalization in Slavyansk, a city in the southeast of Ukraine, detained a bus with passengers, with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities.

The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures."
