"MOSCOW, May 15. /ITAR-TASS/. The Friends of Syria Group meeting that took place in London did not meet Russia’s expectations.

Replying to a question about the meeting of the Friends of Syria Group held in London earlier in the day, Bogdanov told ITAR-TASS, “This is not what we expected from our partners, Western and Arab, because the main political document underlying the Syrian settlement is the Geneva Communiqu?.”

He stressed that this document had been born by the Action Group which includes Russia, China, Turkey, and the European Union.

“We hoped to continue implementing the Geneva Communiqu?, which called for beginning and continuing the intra-Syrian talks, within the Group’s framework. Unfortunately, we lost too much time,” Bogdanov said.

He noted that the Friends of Syria Group supported only the national police which are not the only opposition body, although a large one."
