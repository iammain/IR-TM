"'No to the Nazi coup d'etat in Ukraine!' Rome protesters rally against fascism

A few hundred protesters gathered outside the Ukrainian embassy in Rome on Saturday to protest against the rise of fascism in Ukraine and Europe. The event was organized by well-known journalist Julietto Kieza.


  Kieza told Ruptly that he maintains that the so-called
  revolution in Euromaidan has been paid straightly by the United
  States” and that for the first time since World War II,
  “Nazism reappears in the center of Europe with the aid of the
  United States.”


  Demonstrators came out to express a similar view. Protesters held
  up signs depicting Ukraine’s former Prime Minister Yulia
  Tymoshenko as Hitler, and telling NATO to go away.”


  One of the banners said: No to the Nazi coup d'etat in
  Ukraine in Italian.



  Massive protests that began last year in Kiev eventually led to
  the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovich in February. Yanukovich
  left Ukraine’s capital amid the worst surge of violence in the
  country’s post-Soviet history, which left dozens of people dead
  and hundreds injured. The pro-Maidan opposition immediately
  capitalized on his absence from the city, dominating the
  parliament which then voted to strip the president of his powers
  and announced early elections.



  Following the events, far-right forces such as the Svoboda
  (Freedom) party – Ukraine's nationalist party – entered the
  political arena and are now part of Ukraine’s parliament.


“Only now I perceive that Europe is beginning to understand
  the danger they also face, because there is no solution for the
  crisis in Ukraine in the direction the United States has created.
  Now Europe has to pay,” Kieza said."
