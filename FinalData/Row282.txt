"MOSCOW, April 30 (RIA Novosti) – The Kiev city administration has warned citizens and guests that Ukrainian armed forces will hold military drills involving armored vehicles in the capital on Wednesday night, but the Ukraine's Defense Ministry denied the reports.

“Columns of military hardware will move through the city as part of the exercises,” a statement on the city’s government website says. Military personnel and equipment will be deployed in central Kiev.

No particular reason for the upcoming drills has been announced.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry issued a statement later in the day, denying that any exercises had been planned.

“A statement about special tactical exercises to be held in Kiev, posted by the Kiev city administration today, has nothing to do with the activities of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” the ministry said.

“Personnel and military hardware of the city’s military units remain at their home stations and there are no plans to deploy them in the city center,” it said.

Kiev is expected to hold a military and historical event dedicated to the Victory Day on May 9, involving WWII military equipment.

Earlier Wednesday, Acting Ukrainian President Olexander Turchynov said the country’s armed forces were in full combat readiness amid the threat that Russia could wage a continental war against Ukraine, according to a report by Ukraine’s UNIAN news agency.
