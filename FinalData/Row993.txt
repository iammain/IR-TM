"MOSCOW, May 07. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow welcomes the truce in Homs and urges other regions to follow suit, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, May 7.

“As a result of the several weeks of negotiations between representatives of the Syrian government and the armed opposition, which were actively mediated by the local elders and the United Nations, a package of agreements was approved for unblocking the situation in the Old City of Homs. They call for a ceasefire in the Old City and al-Waar District from 12:00 am local time May 7 as well as for the transportation of rebels in the direction of Talbiseh, north of the city, under the escort of the military, UN officials and representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent,” the ministry said.

Up to 2,500 militants 900 members of the armed opposition and the rest being members of their families - are expected to leave the combat area.

The agreements also call for determining the status of 50 members of illegal armed groups who have laid down their arms. “In addition, 70 captured fighters of the people’s self-defense committee and an Iranian woman, who are being held by militants, will also be released. Humanitarian corridors should be opened to the besieged villages of Zahra and Nubul in the Aleppo province in order to deliver medicines and food there,” the ministry said.

It expressed hope that “the sides will do everything possible to properly implement all the provisions of this important local truce. This will allow the country’s third largest city to return to peaceful life and start rebuilding what has been damaged”.

Russia believes that the “schemes worked out in Homs can be used in other parts of the city”. “It is these practical efforts rather than general statements on the Syrian people’s troubles that help to reduce the level of violence, save hundreds of human lives and ease the suffering of the people in Syria,” the ministry said."
