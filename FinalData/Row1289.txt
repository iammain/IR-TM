"MOSCOW, May 12. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia wants to be useful in the settlement of conflicts in Africa, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at talks with his Ugandan counterpart Sam Kutesa on Monday.

“Certainly, we actively support Uganda’s efforts towards the settlement of different conflicts in Africa. But the situation in the region worries us. We want to be useful,” the foreign minister said.

Last year, the president of Uganda visited Moscow and “major agreements were reached then,” he said. “I believe your current visit is very timely, as a lot has been done for the implementation of the agreements reached during the visit to Moscow by the Ugandan president, but it is necessary to continue and boost them,” the top diplomat said.

He said preparations for a new session of the UN General Assembly would be high on the agenda at the talks, as Uganda is the next to chair the UN General Assembly.

Russia appreciates Uganda’s balanced stance on developments in Ukraine, Lavrov said at talks with Kutesa.

“We have marked a high level of cooperation of our delegations to the United Nations,” the minister said. “We are grateful to partners for their support for Russian projects and resolutions, in particular the resolution against the glorification of Nazism,” he said.

“We appreciate the balanced position of Uganda in connection with the developments in Ukraine, and the position this country has taken up in the United Nations,” Lavrov added."
