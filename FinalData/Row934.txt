"WASHINGTON, May 15 (RIA Novosti) - Russia and China are today's two global heavyweights influencing strategy decisions on current security challenges, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey told the Atlantic Council in a keynote speech.

The world in which we live, and the security which we seek, and the actions which we conduct, are always conducted strategically within the context of what effect it will have on the two heavyweights, that is Russia and China, Gen. Dempsey said, drawing on the logic that today's conflicts demand an evolution of the military to a new security paradigm, that he described using the mnemonic 2, 2, 2, and 1.

Two heavyweights, Russia and China; two middleweights, Iran and North Korea; two networks, Al-Qaeda and the transnational organized crime network; and one system, cyber security, he elaborated, adding that each actor, whether an adversary or potential adversary requires a different approach, as each will respond very differently to different kinds of pressures.

You deter nation states. You use the instruments of power - all of them, diplomatic, economic, and military - differently, whether you're dealing with a nation state, whether you're dealing with a middleweight power who aspires to have more influence than it warrants, who can go rogue from time to time. And certainly networks are not responsive to the kind of pressure that nation states are, he concluded.

General Dempsey met with his Chinese counterpart after addressing the council and will be in Brussels next week to hold extensive meetings with other NATO members."
