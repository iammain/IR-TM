"MOSCOW, May 07. /ITAR-TASS/. National oil and gas company Naftogaz of Ukraine will voluntarily submit information to the European association Gas Storage Europe (GSE) but the association will occasionally check the data provided, GSE press office told ITAR-TASS.

Those who provide data bear responsibility for its accuracy but GSE carried out some validity checks, said the press office.

The company joined Transparency Platform AGSI+ (Gas Storage Inventory) of GSE on May 6. On the same day, the platform reported Ukrainian storages to be 26.68% full (8.523 billion cubic metres). Data about natural gas volumes are also submitted by 31 other underground gas storage operators from 15 EU countries.

Several new members had recently joined AGSI+, and these were not necessarily GSE members, GSE added.


Asked why it was Ukraine that was offered to join the system, GSE said it was aimed to increase transparency as to the volume of gas stored in Europe and therefore approved of Naftogaz’s providing its data.

The data will be submitted weekly, released each Friday and indicate gas volume as of Wednesday of the current week.

Ukraine has 12 underground gas storages with a capacity of about 31 billion cubic meters and these storages are an integral part of Ukraine’s gas supply system and gas transit through its territory to Europe."
