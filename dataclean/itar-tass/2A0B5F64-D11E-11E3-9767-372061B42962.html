Former deputies in western Ukraine speak out against march commemorating SS division KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Former deputies of the town hall in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov who held seats during the first democratic convocation of the legislature in the early 1990s have spoken out against the March of Magnificence of the Spirit (also known as the march of embroidered blouses) scheduled for Sunday to mark a yet another anniversary since the setting up of the Halichina division of the SS by Nazi forces during World War II. The former deputies who were elected to the town hall in 1990 and thus became the founding fathers of regional legislative nationalism issued a special statement in connection with the march. It is noteworthy that the municipal authorities in Lvov and numerous public associations have espoused a radically opposite point of view as regards the marches of the embroidered blouses throughout all the years of Ukraines independence. Nazi ideology was implanted both at general schools (a special textbook on history was written for the Lvov school system) and at all levels of public life. A testimony to this can found in a downtown restaurant styled to a dugout hut of paramilitaries of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army which is profiled there as a highlight of cultural life. Interior and law enforcement agencies in Lvov have traditionally turned a blind eye to the situations where the radicals beat up the veterans of World War II who had fought on the Soviet side of the frontline. The Lvov town hall of the first democratic convocation consisted for the most part of the deputies representing the Rukh (Pathway) party and other nationalistic organizations.
