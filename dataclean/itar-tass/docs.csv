Sanctions against Russia on the part of the Group of Seven will unlikely help resolve the Ukrainian problem and may whip up tensions instead Qin Gang an official spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministrytold ITAR-TASS. Since the outbreak of the crisis in Ukraine we are engaged in an active dialogue with the G7 countries and we have made our position on the issue clear-cut he said. China objects to threats and sanctions. We think the sanctions will hardly help resolve the problem and they can even add fuel to the tensions.

New sanctions against Russia can upset crisis resolution in Ukraine -official LUGANO April 26/ITAR-TASS/. New sanctions the United States and the European Union are threatening to impose on Russia on April 28 is the way in the opposite direction which will only upset the crisis resolution in Ukraine Yuri Vorobyov Deputy Chair of the Federation Council (upper house of parliament) said on Saturday April 26. New sanctions by the EU and the US are the way leading in the opposite direction. We have seen this before. On February 21 the decision was adopted with Poland Germany and France acting as guarantors and a protocol was signed. But it was never implemented. Then Russia the U.S. the EU and Ukraine met in Geneva and made decisions but no one is going to implement them he said. Vorobyov who is in Switzerland on a visit as co-chair of the Switzerland-Russia inter-parliamentary friendship group believes that Kiev bears prime responsibility for this. The agreement must be implemented by Ukraine a country where all these events are taking place. But all sanctions are directed against Russia which is not clear at all he added. Any sanctions will only complicate the settlement process and can do no good. Its a road to nowhere Vorobyov said. I dont think this is a logical way and I see no logic in such decisions they are counterproductive. At their meeting in Brussels on April 28 the ambassadors of the 28 European Union countries are planning to enlarge the black list for Russia. Earlier a U.S. administration official said that Washington might impose additional sanctions on Russia on the same day and that they would be coordinated with Europe but not necessarily identical.

Russian FM: OSCE media freedom representatives remarks on Ukraine distort reality MOSCOW April 23./ITAR-TASS/. OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatovics remarks on the situation in Ukraine distort reality and undermines the authority of this international organisation the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. Moscow has noted the surprisingly biased analysis of the situation regarding the freedom of the media in Ukraine which was made by Dunja Mijatovic in an interview to CNN after a visit to that country the ministry said. The impression is that while announcing her assessments the OSCE representative does not understand or does not want to understand the real causes of the extraordinary danger hanging over the freedom of expression in Ukraine. She mentioned only cursorily more than 200 attacks on journalists on the territory controlled by the Kiev authorities. This is probably the first time after the end of World War Two that representatives of ultra-radical neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic movements have come to power in Europe. It is not surprising that they have basically imposed political censorship in the country the ministry said. Mijatovics position requires her to conduct an objective review of facts and help solve problems pertaining to the violation of the freedom of the media it said. In accordance with her mandate the OSCE representative should have urged those who are holding power in Kiev to begin investigating offences committed against journalists by extremist groups and restrictions on the freedom of the media. Dunja Mijatovics mission is to make Kiev correct the situation. She could have publicly demanded during the interview that journalist Konstantin Dolgov who had been arrested in Kiev under far-fetched pretext be released the ministry said. Russia has repeatedly drawn the attention of the authoritative OSCE institution to the essence of the latest developments in Ukraines mass media. But why does Dunja Mijatovic see the problem elsewhere again namely in the legitimate wish of the Russian-speaking population in the South-East of Ukraine which has been cut off by Kiev from Russian television channels to know the truth? Once again the OSCE representative mixed up the cause and the effect. Instead of giving an honest assessment of the atmosphere of information intolerance created by Kiev the CNN viewers for some reason were told about Russian Crimea again the ministry said. And this was done in a distorted manner ignoring the fact that people had for the first time in history had their linguistic and cultural diversity legitimately recognised and could freely choose the Russian information space where many international channels including CNN are available the ministry said. We would not like to believe that such high-ranking OSCE official is intentionally manipulating facts it added. Nevertheless there is the stubborn reluctance to see reality. These actions are not only imposing a distorted perception of the events in Ukraine upon the rest of the world but also undermining the authority of the whole OSCE the ministry said.

Russia to take all steps to free detained OSCE observers VIENNA April 26 (Itar-Tass) - Detention of military observers from European countries near Slavyansk in Ukraine's Donetsk region hampers de-escalation of the conflict believes Andrei Kelin Russia's permanent representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia was ready to assist to free them he told reporters on Saturday. "We believe the people must be freed as soon as possible" he said. "Russia as an OSCE member will take all possible steps for it." "We do not know circumstances of what happened to them and where they are now but we as other members of the organization are deeply concerned over the incident" the diplomat added. "If they are detained it will not contribute to defusing of tension at the site and will not help de-escalate the conflict." Ukraine invited a group of observers in March in accordance with the Vienna document and responsible for their safety were those who invited the Ukrainian authorities he noted. As is known from media observers made a bold attempt to go to the zone where the situation was extremely tense and residents in the Donetsk region were on alert expecting an army operation to begin at any moment against peaceful protesters the Russian diplomat noted.

Palestinians' legitimate aspirations cant be fulfilled without consolidation - FM MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow welcomes practical steps to reset the process of Palestinian reconciliation the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. It described as important the visit to Gaza by a Palestinian delegation from the West Bank that began on April 22. The delegation led by a Fatah Central Committee member Azzam al-Ahmad met with HAMAS leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh. The two sides agreed to form a Palestinian technocratic government and hold general elections in keeping with the understanding reached earlier the ministry said. We regard this as a step in the right direction. Moscow has always adhered to the opinion that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people cannot be fulfilled and a fair and lasting settlement between Israel and Palestine on the well-known international legal basis cannot be achieved without the consolidation of Palestinian ranks on the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] and the Arab Peace Initiative platform the ministry said. The ministry said it would continue to assist Palestinians in achieving genuine national unity.

MOSCOW April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Russia celebrates Day of Russian Parliamentarism on Sunday April 27 2014. The memorable date was instituted by the June 27 2012 federal law introducing amendments in Article 1.1 of the federal law on days of military glory and memorable dates in Russia. The first Russian State Duma started working on this day in 1906. Last Russian Emperor Nicholas II issued a manifesto on establishing the State Duma as a legislative and consultative body on August 6 1905. However on October 17 1905 the all-Russia political strike made the emperor sign a manifesto on improvement of the state order which vested the Duma with powers of a lawmaking body. A festive opening ceremony of the first Duma was held on April 27 1906. The total number of its members ranged between 480 and 524 in different years. The countrys parliament was empowered to endorse the laws submitted by the government and approve the state budget. In the parliament prior to the revolutionary years party factions were formed. The Duma has introduced the procedure for considering legislative initiatives openness of its meetings deputy requests and settlement of disagreements by conciliatory committees. The law granted the right for freedom of speech at the parliamentary rostrum to lawmakers that was particularly important in Russia in those years. Tsarist Russia has had the four Dumas until the overthrow of monarchy. From the very start of its activity the parliament engaged in confrontation with authorities. As a result from four convocations only the third Duma has worked for the whole legitimate five-year term. The first Duma has worked only for 72 days from April 27 to July 8 1906 being disbanded by Nicholas II. The same fate befell the second State Duma that has worked from February 20 to June 3 1907. This Duma was disbanded over the accusation against the Social Democratic faction of a military coup. The third Duma has worked from November 1 1907 to June 9 1912. The last Duma in the history of Imperial Russia has operated from November 15 1912 until October 6 (19) 1917. In 1917 the February Revolution occurred in the country that resulted in the toppling of the monarchy and a dual power in the country between the Provisional Government and the Council of Workmens and Soldiers Deputies. The Provisional Government attempted to form a new parliament and elections in the first all-Russia Constituent Assembly were held in November 1917. But the Bolsheviks have disbanded the All-Russia Constituent Assembly already on January 6 1918. After the October Revolution in 1917 the All-Russia Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) became the supreme legislative body of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). After establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922 the Central Executive Committee with one house was formed and a two-house supreme state body was founded in 1924 to work between the Congresses of Soviets of the Soviet Union. A two-house Supreme Council has replaced the All-Russia Central Executive Committee in 1936. In the early 90s after the Soviet Union breakup introduction of the post of RSFSR president and re-division of functions between different branches of power became an important change in the state system. The Federal Assembly became a representative and legislative body of Russia according to the Constitution enacted in 1993. The Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation consists of two houses - the Federation Council upper house and the State Duma lower house. The State Duma comprising 450 lawmakers is formed in national direct elections and represents the countrys population in general the Federation Council consisting of 170 members acts as a representative body of constituent entities of the federal state [by one representative from representative and executive authorities in each Russian federal constituent entity]. Lawmakers of the State Duma and the Federation Council work on a professional permanent basis. The State Duma is elected for a five-year term fixed in the countrys Constitution the Federation Council does not have a limited term of powers. Lawmaking is the main function of the State Duma particularly endorsement of federal and constitutional laws resolutions within its jurisdiction. The Federation Council has the main goal to perform legislative powers including consideration of laws approved by the State Duma ratification and denouncement of international treaties the issues of status and protection of the state border the matters of war and peace. The State Duma declares an amnesty empowers the president to appoint the prime minister settles the issue of trust to the government the issue of bringing accusations against the president for his impeachment and hears a governmental report. The Federation Council has the powers to announce presidential elections and to relieve the president from the post. The Federation Council appoints the judges of the Constitutional Court the Supreme Court and the general prosecutor. The State Duma appoints and relieves from the post the Central Bank chairman and the human rights commissioner. Parliamentary houses divide powers to appoint the leadership and auditors of the Chamber of Accounts and members of the Central Election Commission. Meetings of both parliamentary chambers are held separately. First elections in the State Duma in modern Russian history were held on December 12 1993. Lawmakers of the second State Duma were elected on December 17 1995 the third Duma - on December 19 1999 the fourth one - on December 7 2003 the fifth one - on December 2 2007 and the sixth State Duma - on December 4 2011. The first Duma was elected for two years the term of next four lower houses has made four years and current sixth State Duma was elected for five years. Elections in the lower house of parliament were held according to the mixed election system from single-seat constituencies and the federal district [federal lists of candidates] from 1993 to 2003. Fifth and sixth State Dumas were elected according to the proportional system on federal candidate lists nominated by political parties. In 2016 elections in a seventh State Duma will be held according to the mixed election system that envisages that half of deputies [225 lawmakers] will be elected in single-mandate constituencies and another half of lawmakers - in the federal electoral district. The law to this effect was enacted on February 24 2014. At elections in the incumbent sixth State Duma four parties from seven ones registered in the country at that moment were elected in the parliament and formed their factions in the lower house. United Russia Party has gained 238 mandates the Communist Party of Russia (CPRF) - 92 seats A Just Russia Party - 64 seats and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) - 56 mandates. From 2011 Valentina Matviyenko occupies the post of the Federation Council speaker Sergey Naryshkin - the State Duma speaker.

US planning new sanctions against Russia says White House aide WASHINGTON April 27./ITAR-TASS/. U.S. is about to introduce new sanctions to punish Russia and in particular to target a range of individuals and corporations as well as the Russian defense industry U.S. deputy national security advisor Tony Blinken said Sunday on a CBS program. Russias punishment is pursuant to its alleged failure to de-escalate the situation in Ukraines breadwinning eastern regions where the protesters from among the mostly Russian-speaking population whom Washington invariably labels as pro-Russian separatists are demanding a referendum on the future status of the area and the transformation of the country into a federation. "We're going to save a little news for Monday but what I can tell you is this" Blinken said. "We will be looking to designate people who are in his (Russian President Vladimir Putins - Itar-Tass) inner circle who have a significant impact on the Russian economy he said. We'll be looking to designate companies that they and other inner circle people control. We'll be looking at taking steps as well with regard to high-technology exports to their (Russian) defense industry Blinken indicated. All of this together is going to have an impact. Blinken claimed that the sanction introduced by Washington and Brussels after the mid-March referendum in Crimea on reunification with Russia had had a tarnishing effect on the Russian economy. "We've already seen a significant impact of the pressure we've exerted on Russia over the last several weeks he said adding specifically that the Russian financial markets were down 22% since the beginning of the year and the ruble is at the lowest level ever". Vladimir Putin said during a major annual question-time televised show April 17 that the West might be seeking to turn him into a major object of sanctions. Quite possibly theyre making an attempt of this kind. When he was asked about Western sanctions against businessmen Gennady Timchenko Arkady Rotenberg and Boris Rotenberg he said: They are good acquaintances of mine actually friends and they earned their capitals before we got to know each other. For instance Mr. Timchenko has been engaged in business since the beginning of the 1990s Putin said. Speaking seriously they just dont have anything to do with the events in Crimea. He said they had learned about the Crimean events from TV reports like most people in Russia. But they listened to the reports from there literally with tears welling in their eyes and if thats the reason for punishing them then they really have something to be punished for. Putin added in this connection that he had no shame for his friends conduct.

Lavrov urges OSCE to press for speedy release of political prisoners in Ukraine MOSCOW April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation with Swiss Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairperson in Office Didier Burkhalter on Saturday April 26 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of  arrests of public activists in the South-East of Ukraine and urged him to press for their speediest release. Burkhalter told Lavrov that the OSCE had secured access to Donetsk Region peoples governor Pavel Gubarev and would publish a memo on his condition after the visit scheduled for April 26. On Thursday April 24 Lavrov said Moscow had sent official letters to the OSCE and the ICRC requesting immediate access to Gubarev. We will push for immediate access to Gubarev to make sure that he has no problems with health Lavrov said. We will of course continue efforts aimed at ensuring his immediate release as a political prisoner. Lavrov said in an interview with the RT television channel on April 23 that despite an agreement on amnesty for political prisoners Donetsk Region peoples governor Pavel Gubarev is in prison. Gubarev never seized buildings he was arrested only for calls for a referendum on federalisation. Gubarev is a political prisoner. A crowd of demonstrators in a square in the centre of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on March 1 proclaimed Pavel Gubarev peoples governor. The Ukrainian Security Service SBU promptly opened a criminal case against him on the suspicion of calls for changing Ukraines borders. Gubarev detained on March 6 is being held in Kievs pre-trial detention centre. Having thanked Burkhalter for these efforts Lavrov drew his attention to other arrests of public activists in the South-East for political reasons and called on him to press for getting access to them and ultimately for their speediest release the Foreign Ministry said. Burkhalter said he was hoping to get from protesters in the south-eastern regions a complete list of such persons so that he could take necessary measures. He thanked Lavrov for Russias efforts to free the European military observers who had arrived in Ukraine at Kievs invitation under the Vienna Document of 2011 on confidence- and security-building measures and headed to south-eastern regions without properly notifying the public bodies that are controlling the situation in the region. On Friday April 25 supporters of federalisation in Slavyansk a city in the south-East of Ukraine detained a bus with passengers with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities. The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures. Yevgeny Gorbik a spokesperson for the supporters of federalisation told reporters that the detained military observers had been engaged in intelligence activities. The humanitarian group of the [OSCE] mission has denied any relation to them They [observers] had intelligence agents cryptograms and notebooks with secret notes Gorbik said. A Bulgarian officer had a notebook with notes in Russian which confirm his intelligence activities and speak of a meeting with agents he added. No charges have been brought against them so far. But theyve ended up in a company that calls into question the legitimacy of their activities Gorbik said adding The investigation is underway to find out what they were doing and where. Vyacheslav Ponomarev the peoples mayor of Slavyansk said the detained persons were not members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission but were military observers. The military were on our territory without our permission and were detained of course he said. What we should do with them we will know after we have determined who they are and what brought them here Ponomarev said adding that the detainees were being held in normal conditions. One of the military officials has diabetes but we have necessary medications and food [for him]. Ponomarev said the supporters of federalisation were ready to exchange the detained military for their comrades being held by the Kiev authorities. The Kiev junta is holding our comrades. But we are ready for an exchange if there is such a chance he said.

MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Russias Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin believes that a UNpeacekeeping operation will be unrealistic in Ukraine. A United Nations peacekeeping operation is absolutely unrealistic because Ukraine is a very big country and there is no frontline there the Russian diplomat told the Russia 24 TV news channel on April 22. Churkin believes that the OSCE presence in Ukraine will be sufficient and that the most important thing is that the authorities in Kiev realize that the Geneva document should be implemented the right-wing forces should be disarmed and a constitutional reform should be carried out. Then the situation will defuse in its due course and no peacekeeping operation will be necessary Churkin stressed.

FM: Wests accusations of Russias noncompliance with Geneva agreement unfounded MOSCOW April 28 22:45 /ITAR-TASS/. Western countries have no grounds to accuse Russia of failing to implement the Geneva statement of April 17 on de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday April 28 following a G7 statement on April 26. While groundlessly accusing Russia of non-compliance with the Geneva statement of April 17 2014 Western partners state that Ukraine has allegedly taken positive measures the ministry said.

MOSCOW April 28./ITAR-TASS/. Bahrain has no plans to buy Russias SuperJet-100 passenger liner (SSJ-100) Transport Minister Kamal bin Ahmed said on Monday April 28. In 2013 at the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget the SSJ-100 maker Sukhoi Civil Aircraft and the Bahrain leasing company AeroLease signed a letter of intent to finance and/or lease current or future SSJ-100 acquisitions. AeroLease CEO Masood al-Bastaki told reporters back then that the company was planning to buy 4-5 planes at the initial stage to test the market. Sukhoi Civil Aircraft hoped to sign a firm contract before the end of 2013 however no further information on cooperation between the two companies followed. In January 2013 Bahrain Air showed interest in the Russian plane. Its executive director said back then that the company was considering buying 3-5 planes but was choosing between Sukhoi SuperJet-100 and Bombardier. He said the company would make up its mind by the end of the first quarter of 2012. However Bahrain Air was liquidated in February 2013. Bombardier has an impressive share of the Middle East market. Regional companies use more than 200 Bombardier planes and the company says it will supply up to 1000 aircraft in the next twenty years. Sukhoi SuperJet-100 is a regional 100-seat plane designed and made by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in cooperation with Alenia Aermacchi. Its basic version can fly for a distance of up to 3048 kilometres. An increased range is 4578 kilometres. The company plans to start making a long-range version of the plane from 2013 and to offer a business version of the plane in 2015. It may be of interest to Middle East countries. Sukhoi hopes to sell 800 aircraft until the year 2024 while the global demand for the aircraft of this class totals 5400. The SuperJet the first new Russian passenger plane over the past 20 years is being created through unprecedentedly broad international cooperation that involves more than 30 major international aerospace companies system and component suppliers. Sukhoi SuperJet-100 integrates the world's best industry practices and solutions. Sukhoi SuperJet-100 integrates the world's best industry practices and solutions. All aircraft will be certified in accordance with both Russian and international requirements. SSJ100's technical and operational performance make the product fully marketable and capable of taking a solid share in the highly competitive global market. Thus Sukhoi expects to sell 800 aircraft until the year 2024 while the global demand for the aircraft of this class totals 5400. So far the company had secured 73 solid orders for the aircraft. SuperJet-100 will in the future provide the basis for a whole family of planes including transport and special purpose planes. However now the main goal is the certification of the plane and serial production of 60-70 planes annually. The Sukhoi SuperJet-100 family consists of two types of aircraft of basic and increased flying ranges with the carrying capacity of 75 and 95 passengers respectively.

BRATISLAVA April 28./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine is ready to pay its debt to Russias Gazprom for gas supplies at a price of 268.5 U.S. dollars per 1000 cubic metres acting Energy and Coal Industry Minister Yuri Prodan said. Ukraine is ready to pay the debt. But we cannot pay the price Gazprom set from April 1. It is unjustifiably high and is about 500 U.S. dollars. We are ready to pay under our obligations the minister said on Monday April 28. He said that the Ukrainian gas transit system would be incorporated into the European gas transportation system. We can also use the possibilities of our underground gas storage facilities and hope that European gas companies will build up their reserves in our storage facilities he said. Ukraine and Slovakia signed a memorandum of intent in Bratislava earlier in the day agreeing to organise reverse-flow gas supplies to Ukraine. A source familiar with the situation told ITAR-TASS that the amount of gas supplied in reverse mode might increase to 10 billion cubic metres. The two countries also agreed to explore the possibility of reverse-flow supplies by the transit pipeline used by Gazprom to deliver gas to Europe. According to Prodan reverse-flow supplies can reach 8 billion cubic metres by September 1 2014 not by 2015. Gas will be supplied by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline not the transit pipeline. EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said such supplies would not require the Russian companys agreement and would give Ukraine up to 10 billion cubic metres of a gas a year but stressed that reverse-flow gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine by the trunk pipeline would be impossible without Gazproms consent as it would run counter to the Slovak company Eustreams contractual obligations. Oettinger believes that diversification of supplies will help to solve Ukraines gas problem in part. However reverse-flow supplies from Poland and Hungary by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline will not be enough for Ukraine get through the coming winter comfortably. He also said that the European Union was providing support to Kiev on the repayment of its gas debt to Russia. Meanwhile Naftogaz of Ukraine is planning to transport gas from Poland under a contract with Germanys RWE until the end of April and throughout May. According to the declared volumes Naftogaz of Ukraine is to get 4.022 million cubic metres of gas from Poland on April 15-22; 4.08 million cubic metres a day on April 23-30 and 4.022 million cubic metres on May 1-31. Up to date Ukraine was supposed to receive about 40 million cubic meters of gas from Poland. RWE AG resumed gas supplies to Ukraine through its division RWE Supply and Trading on April 15 under a five-year framework agreement with Naftogaz of Ukraine signed in May 2012. RWE supplies to Ukraine are based on the European pricing principles including transportation costs. The agreement provides for the delivery of up to 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year Naftogaz of Ukraine said. In 2013 RWE supplied about 1 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine. The maximum amount of gas Ukraine can get from Poland is 4 million cubic metres a day. However RWE has reiterated its readiness to increase gas supply to Ukraine as soon as transportation restrictions are lifted on the Slovak-Ukrainian border Naftogaz of Ukraine said. The European Union has promised assistance to Ukraine in diversifying natural gas supplies. Kiev is planning to buy about 290 million cubic metres of gas in Europe in reverse mode (about 140 million cubic metres will be delivered through Poland and the rest through Hungary). Ukraine has been receiving natural in reverse flows from Europe since November 1 2012. The gas is supplied across the Ukrainian border with Poland under a contract with from German RWE. The gas is supplied across the Ukrainian border with Poland. RWE planned to supply up to 5 billion cubic metres of gas to Ukraine until May 2013. Last year Naftogaz Ukrainy imported 55 million cubic metres of gas using the reverse flow scheme. The throughput capacity of the Ukrainian gas transportation is 288 billion cubic metres system at the entrance and 178.5 billion cubic meters at the exit including 142.5 billion cubic metres to European countries and 3.5 billion cubic metres to Moldova. Natural gas transit through Ukraine to Europe and CIS countries in 2011 increased by 5.7% from 2010 to 104197067000 cubic metres including to Western Europe by 5.9% to 101098013000 cubic metres but decreased by 2.4% to 3099054000 cubic metres to CIS countries. Ukraines gas transportation system consists of 72 compressor stations 110 production shops and 1451 gas distribution stations. The overall length of gas pipelines operated by the company is 38600 kilometres including 22200 kilometres of trunk pipelines and 16400 kilometres of extensions.

KIEV April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry alleged that the "presence of army units in the east of the country is solely aimed at the protection of citizens." In a press release on Wednesday the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said it believed "Russia should immediately move away" its troops from the border with Ukraine. Meanwhile Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with the RT news channel on Wednesday that "we never denied that we moved additional troops on the border just like Ukrainian authorities moved their troops closer to the Russian border because they moved them to the east and south regions. He also stressed that Russia had been conducting military exercises in different regions of the country on a regular basis since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister. The only thing I would like to highlight at this stage is that the Russian troops are on the Russian territory the requests for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document 2011 and under the treaty of the Open Sky they all have been granted he said. The inspectors visited the areas of deployment of the troops participating in the training exercises No one who participated in the inspections including the Americans Ukrainians and Europeans ever brought up any fact which would indicate that Russia was engaged in some dangerous military activity Lavrov said. "We are on our territory" Lavrov said underlining that Russia was not engaged in any military activity that did not fall under international law. "Ukrainian troops are also on the territory of their country but the difference is that they have an order allowing to use weapons against civilians. It's a criminal order" he said.

Russia surprised by distorted interpretation of Geneva statement by Kiev The Kiev authorities are doing nothing not moving a finger to eliminate the causes of the current deep crisis in Ukraine Sergei Lavrov said MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow is surprised by the distorted interpretation of the Geneva statement by the Kiev authorities and their American partners the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. The statement says that all illegal armed groups must be disarmed. However instead of taking effective measures to implement this agreement Kiev and Washington and some European capitals keep talking about the need to surrender arms only by Ukrainian citizens who are defending their rights in the southeast of Ukraine while turning a blind eye to the continuing provocations by militants from ultra-right forces specifically the so-called Right Sector both in Kiev and different cities in the South and East of the country which resulted in the loss of human life on the night to April 20 the ministry said. Russia continues to believe in the seriousness of our Western partners when they speak about their commitment to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the political crisis in Ukraine. However fact alas prove otherwise. We are still waiting for Kiev to fulfill its promises as it is responsible for fostering dialogue with Ukrainian regions including in the South-East the ministry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier this week urged Kiev to cancel orders on use of army against the population to disarm Right Sector militants and other ultranationalist groups release protesters in the south-eastern regions from detention and stop their prosecution and launch a comprehensive constitutional reform by taking real steps not by making declarations. Lavrov said that the Ukrainian authorities were not complying with the Geneva agreement. Joseph Biden: Russia should join OSCE mission in eastern Ukraine The Kiev authorities are doing nothing not moving a finger to eliminate the causes of the current deep crisis in Ukraine Lavrov said. The Right Sector has been running things in different cities in central and western Ukraine for almost half a year trying to spread its influence to the eastern regions by force he said. Buildings in Kiev which were seized by force at the start of the events in Ukraine have not been vacated the streets have not been unblocked and the Maidan [general term meaning public protests against the authorities] continues to boom excuse the term. The leaders appointed by the Verkhovna Rada [parliament] are saying openly that the Geneva agreement does not apply to the Maidan because the Kiev City Council or city administration has made the decision that the Maidan may stay on and that it is legitimate. This is absolutely unacceptable the minister said. The Geneva meeting on the situation in Ukraine on April 17 agreed on initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all citizens. All sides must refrain from any violence intimidation or provocative actions. The participants strongly condemned and rejected all expressions of extremism racism and religious intolerance including anti-Semitism. All illegal armed groups must be disarmed; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners; all illegally occupied streets squares and other public places in Ukrainian cities and towns must be vacated. Amnesty will be granted to protestors and to those who have left buildings and other public places and surrendered weapons with the exception of those found guilty of capital crimes. It was agreed that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission should play a leading role in assisting Ukrainian authorities and local communities in the immediate implementation of these de-escalation measures wherever they are needed most beginning in the coming days. The USA EU and Russia commit to support this mission in particular by providing observers. The announced constitutional process will be inclusive transparent and accountable. It will include the immediate establishment of a broad national dialogue with outreach to all of Ukraines regions and political constituencies and allow for the consideration of public comments and proposed amendments. The participants underlined the importance of economic and financial stability in Ukraine and would be ready to discuss additional support as the above steps are implemented.

Crimean authorities begin to de-mothball water well in northeastern areas According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev authorities halted water supplies to Crimea via the North Crimean Canal SIMFEROPOL April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Crimeas authorities have launched works to de-mothball water well to replenish drinking water reserves after the Kiev authorities halted water supplies to Crimea via the North Crimean Canal Crimean Minister of Information Dmitry Polonsky told Itar-Tass on Sunday. According to Polonsky fresh water reserves were discovered in Crimea back in the 1970s when Soviet geologists drilled wells in Crimeas northeastern areas. But it was of no need back then he said. Today the situation has changed and we have to do it. So far we have no exact figures the work has just begun Polonsky noted. Earlier Crimeas Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev said that fresh water reserves in the Crimean northeast were enough to provide with drinking water Crimeas south eastern regions including Feodosia and Kerch. In his words works at water wells would be started next week. According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85% of fresh water from this canal which was built in 1961-1971. Crimeas official authorities reassure that the peninsula has enough drinking water whatever actions the current Ukrainian authorities might take although there may be some problems for farmers.

There would be no shortage of food products in Russia Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov says KHABAROVSK April 25./ITAR-TASS/. Russian Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov said there were no politics behind possible decisions to ban some supplies to Russia from some or other countries. "It is usual. It is just presented as something extraordinary due to the politicization of the situation around Ukraine" he said commenting on the reports about a possible ban on supplies of fruit and vegetables from Poland. The minister noted that the federal service for veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance and the federal service for supervision of consumer rights protection and human welfare previously regularly imposed bans because of detection of some diseases or phytosanitary quarantine or other problems. Fyodorov also assured that there would be no shortage of food products in Russia. The Russian Agriculture Ministry rules out any possibility of shortages of some food products because of restrictions or sanctions he told reporters in reply to a question about consequences of possible restrictions on supplies to Russia from some countries. Practically always there are alternative countries and alternative regions that can promptly begin to supply needed products he said. Federal budget spending on Crime to stand at 130 billion rubles minister Rosneft investments in Far East to reach 79 billion rubles by 2015 Rosneft president Russia not to face shortage of any food products because of sanctions minister Ukraine Slovakia to sign deal on reverse gas supply April 28 In his words there are several countries that offer supplies. "They say we have heard about possible restrictions and we would like to be the first to supply products alternatively for example instead of Poland Lithuania or some other country" he noted. Besides a position of farmers in Western countries is far from always being the same as that of their governments. The United States is unwilling now to be a friend of Russia but US producers of poultry pork and beef ask for access to the Russian market the minister notes adding that the influence of farmers in the United States is rather strong. "There are more than six million voters only and with family members there are tens of millions of voters. It is a very influential force in Europe and the US. So we will work if not with the administrations (of the countries) then with farmers of France the Netherlands and Canada" he added. On the whole there can be some minor delays to substitute supplies but no noticeable shortages in stores because of political processes are expected for rather a long period the minister assures.

US not ready to admit it cant run the show around globe Sergei Lavrov "Ukraine is only one case that shows the United States unwillingness to make concessions in the geopolitical struggle" Russia's minister of foreign affairs said Russia surprised by distorted interpretation of Geneva statement by Kiev MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. The United States cant admit that it is unable to manage processes around the world from Washington single-handedly Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with RT television channel. As I said the point is not Ukraine. Ukraine is only one case that shows the United States unwillingness to make concessions in the geopolitical struggle Lavrov said. The Americans are not ready to admit that they cant single-handedly run the show in all corners of the planet from Washington that they cant impose their ready decisions on everyone he said. And they cant realize that is I think they are already beginning to realize but still keep instinctively adhering to the position that they dont need to take into account the opinions and interests of others the Russian foreign minister said. You know that in response to a demand to vacate the illegally occupied buildings in Kiev [US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs] Victoria Nuland said that everything that is still being held by protesters is being held with licenses and with the agreement of the government of Ukraine or with regular leases from the owners of the building he said. Its just incredible! Its hard to believe that they may use such arguments seriously Lavrov said. Sergei Lavrov called on the United States on Wednesday to stop thinking exclusively of geopolitical interests when dealing with the Ukraine crisis. In an interview with RTLavrov said Ukraine was only a manifestation of the USunwillingness to make concessions in its geopolitical struggle. As I said the point is not Ukraine. Ukraine is only a manifestation of USunwillingness to retreat in geopolitical struggle the Russian foreign minister went on to say. The situation in Ukraine is far from stable after a coup occurred in the country in February following months of anti-government protests often violent triggered by President Viktor Yanukovychs decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the European Union in November 2013 in order to study the deal more thoroughly. Amid riots during which radicals seized some government buildings in Kiev new people were brought to power whom Russia does not recognize as Ukraine's legitimate leaders. The self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities appear unable to restrict radicals and ultranationalists. The crisis deepened when Crimea where most residents are Russians refused to recognize the legitimacy of the de facto Ukrainian leadership. Crimea reunified with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which it overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. After the reunification which Kiev and Western countries do not accept despite Russias repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern territories with demonstrators taking control of some government buildings and demanding referendums on the countrys federalization. Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim president Oleksandr Turchynov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region apparently aimed to crack down on pro-federalization protesters.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also intends to hold another telephone conversation on Ukraine with the US state secretary John Kerry on Friday Seven wounded as gunmen hurl bomb at Ukraines Odessa checkpoint MOSCOW April 25. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia will insist on respect to the Geneva accord on Ukraine and will strongly denounce attempts to distort it Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a forum of young diplomats in the Russian capital on Friday. "We will insist on the fulfillment of the Geneva agreements and prevent attempts to distort them" Lavrov noted adding that there "should not be any unilateral demands but attempts were made to present them to us." To make claims to us that we have allegedly signed in Geneva something that delegitimises actions of current authorities is a lie the minister noted. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov plans to speak by telephone with US Secretary of State John Kerry later this Friday to discuss the situation in Ukraine. Addressing a forum of young diplomats on Friday the minister said he also planned to discuss with his US counterpart the fate of Pavel Guberev elected in Donetsk as "people's governor" and currently held in custody. The Foreign Ministry said earlier that telephone contacts between Lavrov and Kerry planned for April 23 and 24 did not take place for reasons beyond Moscow's control. Earlier US Secretary of State John Kerrys statement that Ukrainian law enforcers had allegedly seized several Russian security agents was "not serious talk" Sergei Lavrov said. Kerry has said many times that Ukrainian security services had captured several Russian security agents. So show them to people show them on television Lavrov added. What current Kiev authorities are doing today is a punitive action and a crime against their own people Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. The so-called Easter ceasefire was disrupted the foreign minister said noting that What Kiev authorities are doing today is just a punitive operation which already resulted in many victims. These are bloody crimes for which they will be held responsible". The West wants to take control of Ukraine being guided only by their geo-political ambitions he added. It is high time for Western partners to admit the truth that they do not have a monopoly for truth the minister noted adding that And this is unacceptable to make a certain picture of current events as the West want it to be. The West wants to take control of Ukraine guided only by their geo-political ambitions. Today it is impossible to conceal the truth. And attempts to do so lead to nothing good Lavrov said. If current Kiev authorities really begin to fulfil the Geneva accord take away Maidan protesters and disarm Ukrainian ultranationalists from Right Sector their opponents in south-eastern Ukraine will take reciprocal steps Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov believes Stop to violence should be a first step the minister noted. He noted that this meant an immediate stop to armys actions against their own people. East Ukraine tension mirrors lack of comfort OSCE head says Russia will do everything to defuse the tense situation in Ukraine Sergei Lavrov said. Those who are currently in power in Kiev are to blame for the escalation he noted. "Maidan" remains in Kiev and nobody intends to leave it he said. "Instead of car tyres concrete blocks are placed there now and nobody intends to disperse" the minister said. "Instead of disarming the Right Sector and other radicals Americans rebuke us. "If we want to talk about actions it should be remembered who started the escalation" Lavrov added. "Escalation was started by the current authorities in Kiev who carried out the coup dtat. Russia will not use ultimatums in seeking to achieve goals from events in Ukraine Lavrov said. Certainly we do not have such a heavy-handed discipline which exists in NATO and the European Union though there are some opinions there that are different from the common position the minister said adding that We prefer not to act through ultimatums within the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)...We are decent people after all. When a resolution on Ukraine was moved in the UN General Assembly Americans and Western Europeans primarily Americans sent their emissaries throughout the world. There was not a single country where they had not knocked at with a demand to support compulsorily this Ukrainian resolution. In fact this is not a resolution on Ukraine but an anti-Russian one Lavrov said. Kiev awaiting Moscows explanations for war games in area adjoining border Kremlin verifies information on scale of clashes in Ukraine Putin's spokesman Right Sector radicals seize local administration building in Ivano-Frankovsk region Abkhazia and South Ossetia were not planning to follow Crimea's example Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a forum of young CIS diplomats on Friday. When asked about it the minister said he had not heard there was such intention. "Abkhazia and South Ossetia are our partners and we will respect the way they have chosen" he said. Lavrov added he would meet with the Abkhazian and South Ossetian foreign ministers later on Friday.

Sanctions against Russia to affect French companies French commerce chief warns French business community finds it extremely important to maintain talks between the two countries in different formats amid particularly sharp deterioration of relations between Russia and the West PARIS April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. French business circles consider Russia as a priority partner and if France imposes economic sanctions against Moscow this will affect French companies in the same painful way President of the French-Russian Commerce and Industry Chamber Emmanuel Quidet said on Thursday. We are passing through quite hard times anxiety reigns in French business circles over current situation he said opening the annual Paris conference on French-Russian co-operation and world visions of the countries. French business community finds it extremely important to maintain talks between the two countries in different formats amid particularly sharp deterioration of relations between Russia and the West Quidet said. It would be a worst scenario to interrupt these talks now he noted. EU US companies try to persuade governments not to impose sanctions on Russia FT Sanctions against Russia to speed up integration with Asia Pacific Region speaker As for Russias importance for French business Quidet recalled France was among the three largest foreign investors in Russian economy now. More than 1.2 thousand French companies operate in Russia around six thousand companies are related in some way with export on Russian market he noted adding that This is a total of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Russia is a key trend for us and sanctions would be a catastrophe for both countries. Russian economy remains attractive for foreign investors even despite temporary difficulties and growth of foreign political tension amid current Ukrainian crisis the head of the French-Russian Commerce and Industry Chamber added. In fact some slowdown is observed but it will be temporary Quidet said. In general Russia has several undisputable advantages including a low level of state debt massive gold and foreign currency reserves and an extremely strong middle class that had not been affected in the recent economic crisis he said. Russian market is one of most attractive for France and the country cannot be absent there the French commerce chief executive said.

Ukrainian FM invites Russia to hold talks in Vienna April 28 It said that in reply to Kievs inquiry Moscow had failed to provide exhaustive explanations regarding the purpose and place of military manoeuvres held in the Southern and Western Military Districts KIEV April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has invited Russia to hold talks in Vienna on April 28 under the Vienna Document of April 28 on confidenceand security-building measures. It said that in reply to Kievs inquiry Moscow had failed to provide exhaustive explanations regarding the purpose and place of military manoeuvres held in the Southern and Western Military Districts over the past several days near the Ukrainian border the date of their completion and the number and type of military units involved. ICRC OSCE Kiev agree on visit to jailed Donetsk peoples governor Given the insufficient information received Ukraine has suggested to the Russian Federation that consultations be held in Vienna on April 28 as provided for in the abovementioned document in order to discuss this issue. Other states that have voiced concern about Russias military activities near the Ukrainian border have also been invited to take part in the consultations the Foreign Ministry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the Russia Today television channel this week that Russian troops were staying on their own territory and were not taking any steps that would go against their obligations. We have never denied the fact that we sent additional troops to the border [with Ukraine] just as the Ukrainian government redeployed its troops closer to our border. Our troops are conducting exercises on the territory of our own country. Such exercises are conducted regularly since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister Lavrov said. Exercises are held in different parts of Russia. As far as I know the next exercises will be held in the north-west of the country. This is a continuous process. The army must be in good shape and ready to act while hoping that it will not have to interfere the minister said. However if we are attacked we will respond by all means. If our legitimate interests and the interests of Russian people are directly affected as was the case in South Ossetia I see no way to respond other than doping so in full compliance with international law. Those who threaten the security of Russian citizens jeopardise the security of the whole country Lavrov said. He stressed the fact that Russian troops were staying on the territory of Russia. Demands for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document of 2011 and the Treaty on Open Skies were satisfied. Inspectors from the United States the European Union and Ukraine visited Russian troops bases and could not cite even one fact that would signify dangerous military activities on the part of Russia the minister said. We are on our own territory and are not taking any actions that would go against our obligations he said. Ukrainian troops are also staying on their territory but the difference is that they have an order allowing them to use weapons against peaceful citizens. This is a criminal order.

In Ukrainian crisis conditions Switzerland gives constructive dialogue example - official BELLINZONA (Switzerland) April 27 /ITAR-TASS/. Switzerland has shown an example of constructive dialogue and co-operation demonstrating in the difficult political situation the right approach to the solution of the acute problem that has been caused by the Ukrainian crisis deputy speaker of the Federation Council upper house of Russias parliament Yuri Vorobyov told Itar-Tass. He paid a working visit to Switzerland as a co-chair of the Switzerland-Russia inter-parliamentary friendship group. The position of Switzerland is very cautious and is based on an attempt to preserve its neutrality and simultaneously not to break relations with the European Union Vorobyov said. But nevertheless Switzerland is showing an example of constructive dialogue and co-operation. Switzerland today is a country in the European Union that demonstrates in the difficult political situation the right approach to the solution of the acute problem the FC member added. The co-chair of the friendship group from the Swiss side President of the Council of States (upper house) of the parliament of Switzerland Filippo Lombardi for his part expressed the hope for mediator efforts of the confederation especially in view of the fact that it chairs this year the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Switzerland currently presides in the OSCE and we hope that it will play its decisive role in the current difficult situation Lombardi said. Bern had previously refused to automatically repeat the EU and U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its position on Ukraine. At the same time the Federal Council (government) of Switzerland has taken measures not allowing the blacklisted by the EU persons to bypass the sanctions using Swiss banks. Thus they are prohibited to transfer money to Swiss banks however their existing accounts there will not be frozen. Vrorobyov also criticised the conduct of the majority of European parliamentarians in light of the Ukrainian crisis. In May we wanted to hold a meeting of the Association of European Senates but many countries have still not answered to this invitation or have refused he said. How can we settle complex political issues without meeting at the parliamentary level without discussing the hot issues and without hearing both sides the FC deputy speaker said calling such an approach an obvious demonstration of a counterproductive wrong conduct of politicians.

Russian Defence Minister said the increase in the activity of the U.S. and NATO armed forces in Eastern Europe near the Russian border was unprecedented MOSCOW April  Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu flatly denied unfounded assertions about the presence of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in Ukraine where they are allegedly destabilising the situation in south-eastern regions of the country. In a telephone conversation on Monday April 28 Shoigu and his U.S. counterpart Chuck Hagel had a frank one-hour conversation and exchanged concerns about tensions in Ukraine the Defence Ministry press service said. At the same time Shoigu said that under the pretext of fighting terrorism the Kiev regime had amassed about 80 tanks over 130 armoured personnel carriers and fighting vehicles at least 60 artillery systems and mortars in the South-East of Ukraine. Combat aircraft and helicopters are engaged on a regular basis. The overall number of Ukrainian troops has reached 15000 personnel and all this against the peaceful population of their own country the minister said. The possibility of forceful actions against peaceful people caused Russia to start large-scale manoeuvres on the national territory in regions bordering on Ukraine. This decision was made public he said. However as soon as the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had no intention to use regular military units against unarmed people the Russian units were ordered back to their bases. Shoigu said the increase in the activity of the U.S. and NATO armed forces in Eastern Europe near the Russian border was unprecedented and stressed that these actions have been accompanied by provocative statements by the NATO Secretary-General on the need to deter Russia the ministry said. The Russian Defence Minister also drew the attention of his American colleague to the anti-Russian hysteria unleashed lately in the Western press which does not help to calm down passions the press centre said. Hagel said these steps had been undertaken by Washington and Brussels in response to the situation in Ukraine but they were not provocative or expansionist and aimed to demonstrate the bloc unity and increased defence capabilities of the allies. Shoigu reaffirmed his readiness to maintain contact with all sides concerned in order to de-escalate tensions in and around Ukraine. He also called for constructive dialogue and search for compromises on the basis of the Geneva accord of April 17. The minister also commented on the incidents in which two Russian Su-24 planes flew over the American destroyer Donald Cook in Black Sea on April 12 and a Russian Su-27 jet fighter escorted an American RC-135 plane over the Sea of Okhotsk on April 22. Shoigu suggested instructing the chiefs of the Russian and American General Staff to discuss possible additional measures to avoid misinterpretation of each others actions in the future. The minister and the secretary agreed to maintain close contact.

Leader of Bulgarian Socialist Party: there are no grounds for sanctions against Russia SOFIA April 27./ITAR-TASS/. There are no grounds to impose economic sanctions against Russia Sergei Stanishev the leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party said on Sunday adding that problems in relations between Russia and Ukraine could be resolved by political means. The crisis in relations between Russia and Ukraine can be settled only by political means he told journalists. In his words any other tools used to settle the crisis situation in Ukraine would only create a spiral of tension reviving the cold war rhetoric and prompting actions that only aggravated the conflict. I see no grounds to impose economic sanctions against Russia he stressed.

Lavrov Kerry state 92 prc of chemicals removed from Syria MOSCOW April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation on Saturday April 26 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that 92% of chemical material had been removed from Syria up to date. The Joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has confirmed delivery of a further shipment of chemical weapons material which has brought the total of chemical material removed and destroyed in country to 92.5% I welcome the significant progress of the last three weeks and I strongly encourage the Syrian authorities to conclude the removal operations as part of their efforts to achieve the 30 June 2014 deadline. Particular thanks goes to Member States for their steadfast support U.N./OPCW Joint Mission Special Coordinator Sigrid Kaag. In addition to the removal operations the Syrian authorities have destroyed buildings equipment and empty mustard gas containers and decontaminated other containers in a number of chemical weapons storage and production sites. A majority of these sites are now closed. Kaag said on April 22 that the removal of chemicals from Syria would be completed within the next few days. This will contribute to meeting the deadlines set by the OPCW Executive Council including the June 30 2014 target date for completing the destruction of Syrias entire chemical weapons programme. The renewed pace in movements is positive and necessary to ensure progress towards a tight deadline she said. According to the OPCW no chemical weapons will be left in Syria by April 27. They will be destroyed by Britain Germany the United States and Finland. When all of the Syrian chemicals from all storage sites have been loaded aboard the Danish and Norwegian cargo ships they will be transported to various locations for destruction under the verification of OPCW inspectors. The majority of Priority 1 chemicals will be neutralised at sea aboard the U.S. vessel MV Cape Ray while a smaller amount will be neutralised at a land-based facility in Ellesmere Port UK. The Priority 2 chemicals will be destroyed at commercial facilities in the U.S. and Finland. A facility in Germany will dispose of part of the effluent from the Cape Ray operations the OPCW said. The Syrian Government informed the Joint Mission of a revised plan for removing all relevant chemicals from its territory by April 27. The amended plan was considered by the OPCW Executive Council in The Hague in early March 7. Western countries were concerned that the delays would not allow Syria to destroy all of its chemical weapons by June 30 2014 as was initially planned and it will need a delay of several months. The removal of the most critical material for destruction began on January 7 2014 a week after the deadline for its completion set by an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States under which Syria renounced its chemical weapons material and joined 1992 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons. On November 15 2013 the OPCW Executive Council (EC) approved a detailed plan of destruction to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons stockpile. In the plan Syrian chemical weapons will be transported for destruction outside its territory to ensure their destruction in the safest and soonest manner and no later than June 30 2014. Under Security Council Resolution 2118 (2013) and decisions of the OPCW Executive Council Syrias entire chemical weapons programme is to be destroyed by June 30 2014. Syria renounced its chemical weapons material and joined 1992 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons under an agreement brokered last year by Russia and the United States.

German federal lands Saxony-Anhalt Brandenburg Baden-Wuerttemberg Saxony and Bremen will be hit the hardest by possible sanctions against Russia over Crimea said a research material by Munich-based IFO Institute for Economic Research on Monday.

Ukraine federalisation supporters protesting in 2 big east Ukrainian cities KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Several hundreds of people have assembled Sunday on the central square in the eastern Ukrainian major city of Kharkov with a demand to hold a referendum on federalisation of Ukraine. Local media reported that women from the so-called womens movement of Kharkov are participating in the rally prepared to go to the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk to support peoples militia. Meanwhile protesters said they were in solidarity with other south-eastern regions of Ukraine which also came out against current Kiev authorities. Lenin Square where the rally goes on is blocked almost completely but the central Sumskaya Street passing through the square is opened for traffic. Demonstrators said that they plan to stage a multi-thousand protest action against current Kiev authorities on May 1. Meanwhile around three thousand people are participating in a rally on Lenin Square in the centre of another big eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk local media reported on Sunday. The action began with a minute of silence in commemoration of Berkut police commandoes who perished in the clashes between law enforcers and radicals on Independence Square in central Kiev and in memory of activists who were killed by Right Sector radical ultranationalists on the Easter night at a checkpoint near another eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk. Protesters demand a referendum on federalisation chanting slogans No to bloody Kiev junta! and Stop the occupation of Donbas [a large Ukrainian coalmining region]! Activists of the self-proclaimed Donetsk peoples republic who fenced off the square ensure law and order at the rally.

Lavrov calls for end to army operation against protesters in Ukraine MOSCOW April 26./ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday April 26 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an end to the army operation against protesters in southeastern Ukraine and for stopping aggressive actions of ultranationalists from the Right Sector. Lavrov also urged Kerry to use his influence for getting arrested protest leaders released. He [Lavrov] once again highlighted the issue of political prisoners and urged the United States to use its influence in order to get detained protest leaders in the South-East of Ukraine released. The secretarys attention was drawn to the proposals put forth by the Party of Regions and public movements in the South-East regarding the start of a nationwide dialogue and constitutional reform the Foreign Ministry said. Kerry assured Lavrov that Washington would seek to use its possibilities to prod the Kiev authorities into taking concrete steps to ease tensions and expressed hope that south-eastern regions would reciprocate. Lavrov and Kerry also discussed the steps being taken to settle the incident with the detention of European military observers who have arrived in Ukraine at Kievs invitation under the Vienna Document of 2011 on confidence- and security-building measures. They travelled to the South-East without properly notifying the public bodies that are controlling the situation in the region. On Friday April 25 supporters of federalisation detained a bus with passengers with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities. The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures. Yevgeny Gorbik a spokesperson for the supporters of federalisation told reporters that the detained military observers had been engaged in intelligence activities. The humanitarian group of the [OSCE] mission has denied any relation to them They [observers] had intelligence agents cryptograms and notebooks with secret notes Gorbik said. A Bulgarian officer had a notebook with notes in Russian which confirm his intelligence activities and speak of a meeting with agents he added. No charges have been brought against them so far. But theyve ended up in a company that calls into question the legitimacy of their activities Gorbik said adding The investigation is underway to find out what they were doing and where.

Lavrov: Russia insisting on investigation of reports on Greystones involvement in Urkaine He said the military observers by the OSCE had admitted the absence of any evidence of the presence of Russian military observers in eastern Ukraine MOSCOW April 23./ITAR-TASS/. Russia insists on investigation of reports on involvement of the U.S. private military organization Greystone in the current events in Ukraine Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday in an interview with the Russia Today television channel. He said the military observers dispatched to Ukraine by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) had admitted the absence of any evidence of the presence of Russian military observers in eastern Ukraine. They noted only a possibility of the presence there of some kind of military advisers but he said they should continue watching the situation to understand the situation better. The only fact the Americans made references to was that the fighters (in eastern Ukraine - Itar-Tass) was the people there were using the weapons of Russian manufacture but everyone in Ukraine uses Russian weaponry for instance the Kalashnikov assault rifle or the Makarov handgun Lavrov said. This means a proof of this sort can scarcely be called sufficient. He also said reports had come several days ago on discovery of a cache with U.S. weaponry in Ukraine adding: This should necessarily be investigated. Lavrov recalled that the Russian side had raised the problem during contacts with U.S. counterparts. Some reports said several hundred specialists from the private military company Greystone had arrived Ukraine from the U.S. he said. Also reports said foreigners had been involved in several accidents. Americans told us they didnt have any information on this and then they said they had referred the question directly to Greystone and the organization had denied any involvement on its part. Still wed like to know who is doing certain things because there are too many deflections of reality otherwise if you use the language of diplomacy Lavrov said.

Russia had never said it had already refused to accept the poll results Russian lawmaker says Russian delegation not to participate in June PACE session - Russian lawmaker MOSCOW April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Kiev authorities' behaviour towards candidates they oppose reinforces doubt about the forthcoming presidential election head of the foreign affairs committee in Russias State Duma lower house of parliament Alexei Pushkov told a news briefing on Thursday. Russia had never said it had already refused to accept the poll results. But it had strong doubts about whether the election scheduled for May 25 could be considered open legitimate and democratic Pushkov said. The actions that Kiev radicals take regarding all the other undesired candidates strengthen these doubts he added. Key to events was the attitude of Ukrainians who were against the current government. If those who stand against Kiev's authorities ignore the forthcoming election it will be very difficult for Russia to accept the poll results as correct and democratic Pushkov said. East Ukraine tension mirrors mistrust of Kiev leaders OSCE head says Shoigu: 11000 servicemen involved in operation against civilians in Ukraines southeast Ukraine to hold early elections despite developments in eastern regions A total of 23 people were registered by Ukraines Central Election Commission to run for the countrys presidency. Nine registered candidates were nominated by political parties. Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was nominated by the Batkivshchyna (Fatherland) party former Defense Minister Anatoliy Hrytsenko by the Civil Position party former Minister of Revenues and Duties Oleksandr Klymenko by the Ukrainian Peoples Party former Minister of Social Policy Natalia Korolevska by the Ukraine-Forward party Vasyl Kuybida by the Peoples Movement of Ukraine (Rukh) Oleh Lyashko by the Radical Party Petro Symonenko by the Ukrainian Communist Party Oleg Tyagnibok by the Svoboda (Freedom) party and Dmytro Yarosh by the radical Right Sector organization. Other candidates including tycoon Petro Poroshenko are self-nominees. Poroshenko however can count on the support from Vitali Klitschkos UDAR party while Mykhailo Dobkin is backed by the Party of Regions.

Ukraine's extremist organization Right Sector has moved its headquarters from Kiev to Dnepropetrovsk said its leader Dmitry Yarosh who is running for president.

Earlier local media reported a meeting in camera between Yarosh and head of the Dneptropetrovsk regional administration Igor Kolomoisky.

Neo-Nazis holding action in Lvov to commemorate Ukrainian SS division KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. An action of pro-Nazi Ukrainian nationalists dedicated to a yet another anniversary since the setting up of the Halichina Ukrainian division of the SS was held in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov Sunday local news media said. Several hundred radicals gathered near the monument to the most odious figure in the history of Ukrainian nationalism Stepan Bandera. The organizers said about 3000 people might take part all in all. Earlier on the same day former deputies of the Lvov town hall who had seats there in the first democratically elected convocation in the early 1990s issued a highly untypical statement voicing protest against the street march of the neo-Nazis which they said might inflict damage on the countrys national unity. The Lvov town hall of the first democratic convocation consisted for the most part of the deputies representing the Rukh (Pathway) party and other nationalistic organizations. It is noteworthy that the municipal authorities in Lvov and numerous public associations have espoused a radically opposite point of view as regards the marches of the embroidered blouses throughout all the years of Ukraines independence. Nazi ideology was implanted both at general schools (a special textbook on history was written for the Lvov school system) and at all levels of public life. A testimony to this can found in a downtown restaurant styled to a dugout hut of paramilitaries of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army which is profiled there as a highlight of cultural life. Interior and law enforcement agencies in Lvov have traditionally turned a blind eye to the situations where the radicals beat up the veterans of World War II who had fought on the Soviet side of the frontline.

German politician says dispatching of Germany military observers to Ukraine silly action BERLIN April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Germanys government did a silly and highly unprofessional thing as it sent a group of Bundeswehr experts to Ukraine upon an arrangement with the Kiev authorities Alexander Neu a deputy of Bundestag representing the Left Party said Sunday at a meeting of the parliamentary committee on defense. He believes an agreement on a verification operation or on the sending of military specialists to the east of Ukraine that was reached by Berlin and Kiev is doing an obvious disservice to the properly diplomatic observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that is currently doing its job in Ukraine. Charges of espionage that have been issued to the group by the pro-Russian activists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk cannot be dismissed altogether as a minimum and in addition to it a question arises on why the detained officers are traveling the east of Ukraine precisely at this moment Neu said. The group that supposedly includes three German military experts a translator and observers from Denmark Poland the Czech Republic and Sweden one person from each country arrived in Ukraine under the cover of the OSCE at the invitation of Ukrainian government. It was arrested by peoples self-defense forces near the eastern town of Slavyansk Friday with the city officials saying the group had been engaging in espionage. On Sunday Bundeswehr Colonel Alex Schneider one of the groups members appeared at a news conference in Slavyansk to tell the reporters that he and other members of the group were getting fair and friendly treatment from their detainers in the rebellious East-Ukrainian city where the population is demanding a referendum on the future status of the Donbass Coalfields area and Ukraines changeover to a federated state structure. Col Schneider said the military experts making up the group were in good health and no one had done physical harm to them after their detention. He added he did not known when their release might take place. He said members of the group had spoken much to the people who had been guarding them since their arrival in Slavyansk and they had learned much about how the situation was affecting the locals families and how the current situation was exerting impact on peoples lives. Col Schneider also said the group members had been stunned upon seeing the level of impoverishment of the local people. In the meantime a spokesman for Bundeswehr said Sunday the dispatching of observers to Ukraine by a number of member-states of the OSCE had been coordinated with the security organizations steering bodies. He said the case in hand was not a bilateral measure of any kind but rather a coordinated mission at the invitation of the Kiev authorities adding that inspections of this kind began last month. The spokesman said that Germany was the fourth country to take on the leadership of a mission the alleged purpose of which was to build up transparency and to steer the formation of trust.

Lawmakers still unable to agree on memorandum on settlement in eastern Ukraine KIEV April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine's parliament will make a new attempt on Thursday to coordinate the memorandum on settling the situation in the east of the country along with the bill to amnesty participants in the protests that swept across the eastern regions. Though the documents are not formally on the Thursday agenda lawmakers said they would be added as soon as a consensus was reached between the opposition /the Party of Regions and the Communists/ and the coalition comprising the Batkivshchina UDAR and Svoboda factions and two groups of lawmakers. On Wednesday the heads of the factions failed to reach an accord on the bill on amnesty for protesters in the east of the country. At present six alternative documents are offered for review in parliament. The cabinet submitted its own bill on inadmissibility of prosecution for the events during mass actions of civil confrontation that began on February 22 2014. The Party of Regions in the bill of its own called for amnestying all those who had captured administrative buildings in eastern regions as the new authorities had amnestied the protesters on Kiev's Independence Square. However the coalition which called the Maidan supporters "patriots" denounced protesters in the east as "separatists." It said it would object to exempting from punishment all the participants in the protests in the Donetsk Lugansk and Kharkov regions. Nor can the parliamentary factions come to terms on the memorandum on settling the situation in the east. Acting head of Batkivshchina Sergei Sobolev said that the Party of Regions and the Communists had snubbed with the document drawn by the coalition. "At present there is actually no support from the Party of Regions or the Communists for the draft of the memorandum of mutual understanding brought forward by speaker of Verkhovnaya Rada /parliament/ and the heads of the factions of the parliamentary majority" Sobolev said. Speaker Alexander Turchinov's document contains several provisions which the opposition flatly rejects. The document does not envision federalization broader powers for regions official status for other languages in certain regions and amendments to the Constitution. Last week the coalition tried to put Turchinov's document on the agenda but it failed short of the required 226 votes. Lawmakers came close to "the format of passing the memorandum" but had not reached a consensus yet the speaker said in comments on the situation. The Party of Regions drew its own version of the memorandum. Together with the Communists it calls for "fixing in the Constitution the status of Russian as the second state language." They also offered to immediately adopt the laws on reform of local self rule and regional governance. Specifically the document proposes replacing regional and district state administrations with executive committees of regional and district councils and delegating executive powers to them. The Party of regions also insists on direct elections of chairpersons of regional councils by regional communities in an open vote by residents and on providing necessary funding to regions through the establishment of fair distribution of budget revenue. Local authorities in the east of the country support these demands. For example deputies of the Kharkov Town Council asked Ukrainian lawmakers to pass a law on local referenda to realize people's right to the expression of will. "We the legitimately elected representatives of Kharkov support Kharkov residents' rights to the expression of their views and peaceful actions" the deputies said in a statement. They also said they were at one with regional residents' position voiced during an opinion pool in Kharkov in 2002 on using Russian together with the state language in all spheres of public life. Kharkov Town Council also asked the parliament to "take measures aimed at restoring citizens' constitutional rights to information and ensure the resumption of broadcasting of Russian television channels." Kiev-appointed chairman of the Donetsk region state administration /OGA/ Sergei Taruta called for all-Ukrainian referendum on the status of the Russian language and decentralisation of Ukraine. "People want the referendum and should be given the opportunity to hold it. I suggest setting the date for May 25 the day of Ukrainian presidential election" Taruta said. He believes it is necessary to begin to formulate questions for the referendum as soon as possible in order to secure accord between all the interested parties. His initiative was supported by mayors district councils and state administrations of the Donetsk region.

The Kiev authorities should make the first step toward national reconciliation Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. The authorities in Kiev should take into account the regions demands and establish a dialogue Lavrov added. The foreign minister noted that over the last months the illegal militant groups were not disarmed. On the contrary the Kiev authorities started to rely more upon them.This in turn triggered the aggravation of the situation in the south-east of the country Lavrov emphasized. The agreement of February 21 was broken next day in the state coup. After that it became obvious that those who came to power were not able to bring everything to order in Kiev and in the country to control extremists Lavrov said. Illegal militant groups were not disarmed as was stipulated in the February 21 agreement. On the contrary they (Kiev authorities) relied on these groups that controlled the situation in the country and indulged the Right Sector the foreign minister added. What is now happening in Sloviansk what happened overnight in Mariupol these are the results of the irresponsible policy that relies upon ultranationalist extremist Neo-Nazi groups which should have been disarmed in accordance with the February 21 agreements Lavrov said.

Economic sanctions may benefit Russia by helping de-offshorize its economy and create better conditions for doing business inside the country President Vladimir Putin said. Many people who take their savings and business to low-tax areas are already thinking whether it would be better to carry out all of their economic activities including registration at home the president said at the Media Forum on Thursday April 24. As for de-offshorization the Russian authorities are facing many important and necessary tasks to create better conditions for doing business inside the country he said. This means the tax system its stability rates the fight against excessive bureaucratization and corruption and many other things. Putin believes that sanctions will also prod the Russian authorities into working harder and taking measures to strengthen the sovereignty of the national economy by creating a national payment system or drafting a law on enhanced sovereignty in strategic industries. The world is globalizing and the economy and politics are closely interdependent but excessive dependence leads to the loss of sovereignty Putin said with regret and cited the countrys gold and currency reserves as an example. Some countries with large gold and currency reserves diversify them one way or another he added. We did not create our own settlement system as Japan or China did and this makes us completely dependent on our partners the president said. We have always believed that our partners both Visa and MasterCard are depoliticized economic entities and companies. However as it turned out they too are under strong political pressure and influence and give in to it right away he said. Operators of international payment systems must be brought to senses - Medvedev Experts: Russia needs 2-3 years to create national payment system Creation of Russia nationwide payment system to take 2-6 months Sberbank chief Putin intends to open account in US sanctioned bank Rossiya Putin to get salary through bank Rossiya that fell under US sanctions From the economic point of view this is a big mistake because MasterCard and Visa control 90% of the Russian market which we gave to them of our own free will and all payments inside the country go through these systems and to a large extent through serves located in the United States. But thats nonsense! Why did Japan do it and can use a national payment system now but we are using their [American] systems inside the country I am not saying abroad where you go on a business trip or vacation Putin said This is a very big business for these companies. By acting the way they are acting in Russia they are undermining trust in themselves and therefore will certainly lose the market he said. At the same time he noted that the Russian authorities were not planning any retaliatory sanctions against MasterCard or Visa. However not only have we thought about it but we have also started creating our own national payment system Putin said. Putin said in March that Russia would create its own payment system. These systems work successfully in such countries as Japan and China. They started off as national systems for domestic needs only but are now becoming increasingly popular he said. The Japanese system now operates in 200 countries. Why shouldnt we do the same? We should and we will Putin said at a meeting with the leadership of the Federation Council the upper house of parliament. The Central Bank of Russia is already making plans for creating a national payment system in the country. We should create a system that will ensure uninterrupted domestic payments that make up about 90 percent of the total. We are preparing measures that should be realistic easy and gradual. At the initial stage we should ensure technological compatibility between processing and operating centers of major banks so that they could switch over quickly Central Bank Chair Elvira Nabiullina said. A draft law ensuring uninterrupted money transfers within Russia will go to the State Duma lower house of parliament shortly. It bans all participants from terminating transfers unilaterally. Clearing centers will not be allowed to provide information about money transfers outside the country or make such information accessible from other countries. In 2011 several MPs called for creating a domestic processing centre. The relevant law was adopted but processing operations were not transferred to Russia despite the risk of losing access to international payment systems for Russian banks. This is precisely what happened on March 21 2014 when Visa and MasterCard both headquartered in the United States suspended operations for several Russian banks. The blocking of access to the SWIFT inter-bank payment system makes online payments in any currency except the national one impossible. Presidential adviser Sergei Glazyev suggests creating a single processing centre for payments within the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Customs Union created by Belarus Kazakhstan and Russia.

Former deputies in western Ukraine speak out against march commemorating SS division KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Former deputies of the town hall in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov who held seats during the first democratic convocation of the legislature in the early 1990s have spoken out against the March of Magnificence of the Spirit (also known as the march of embroidered blouses) scheduled for Sunday to mark a yet another anniversary since the setting up of the Halichina division of the SS by Nazi forces during World War II. The former deputies who were elected to the town hall in 1990 and thus became the founding fathers of regional legislative nationalism issued a special statement in connection with the march. It is noteworthy that the municipal authorities in Lvov and numerous public associations have espoused a radically opposite point of view as regards the marches of the embroidered blouses throughout all the years of Ukraines independence. Nazi ideology was implanted both at general schools (a special textbook on history was written for the Lvov school system) and at all levels of public life. A testimony to this can found in a downtown restaurant styled to a dugout hut of paramilitaries of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army which is profiled there as a highlight of cultural life. Interior and law enforcement agencies in Lvov have traditionally turned a blind eye to the situations where the radicals beat up the veterans of World War II who had fought on the Soviet side of the frontline. The Lvov town hall of the first democratic convocation consisted for the most part of the deputies representing the Rukh (Pathway) party and other nationalistic organizations.

USA to announce further sanctions vs. Russia later on Monday According to Barack Obama they would be a response to Russia's failure to uphold an international accord aimed at stemming the crisis in Ukraine TOKYO April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. The US will announce a new package of sanctions against Russian individuals and companies in the course of the day US President Barack Obama stated in Manila where he is currently on an official visit. He added that the new sanctions are in response to Russia's failure to uphold an international accord aimed at stemming the crisis in Ukraine. Obama noted that the sanctions would be aimed at Russian citizens and companies. The sanctions would also affect the export of hi-tech commodities to Russia the American leader said. USA publishes sanctions list with several Russian and Ukrainian officials US State Department restricts sale of defense products to Russia EU has published a list of 21 sanctioned Russian and Crimean officials EU expands black list of Russians and cancels EU-Russia summit in June The USA imposed sanctions against Russia in response to its stance over Crimeas status. March 17 the USA announced a black list including 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials. In March and April the list has been expanded several times. To date the list includes several dozens of people who as US authorities believe undermine Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity. In addition the USA has suspended cooperation with Russia in the field of combating drug trafficking and in the space industry (except for the International Space Station project) and introduced restrictions for supplying military and double-purpose products to Russia. They should not treat Russia as a naughty schoolgirl who is being poked with a piece of paper on which she must tick off a report on her homework. It is impossible Seven leading industrialized states threatened Russia with further sanctions with regard to the situation around Ukraine. This says a G7 statement issued by the White House April 25. Governments of Canada France Germany Italy Japan Great Britain and USA as well as the European Union and the European Commission warned that they would not hesitate to impose additional sanctions against Russia. The authors of the statement believe that Russia is not taking any concrete steps to support the Geneva agreement and does not condemn separatists seeking to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. Moscow is also accused of holding threatening military drills near the Ukrainian border. The EU Council plans to adopt a regulation on expanding the black list for Russia until Monday evening. The list which includes so far 33 names may be completed by another 10-15 names of Russian officials and defense agencies representatives. All of them are banned entry to EU countries and possible assets on EU territory are frozen. Ambassadors of 28 members states of the EU also plan to discuss trade and economic sanctions against Russia. However as a diplomatic source told ITAR-TASS earlier there is no unity among the EU states on the appropriate economic measures against Russia nor is there any consensus on the necessity to introduce them. Representatives of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) which is in the ruling coalition believe that the possible introduction of further sanctions against Russia would not be an effective instrument in settling the Ukrainian crisis. Thus Deputy Head of SPD faction in the Bundestag Axel Schfer stated in an interview for Reinische Post newspaper that sanctions would hardly have any significance other than symbolic. Instead of this we should make even more diplomatic efforts and use every opportunity for dialogue with Russia the politician believes. A similar point of view expressed the SPD factions representative for military issues Reiner Arnold. I dont think that sanctions against specific people in Russia would have a positive effect on the overall situation (in Ukraine) he pointed out. The politician says that neither the increased NATO activity on eastern borders would yield any result. Schfer specified that federalization supporters in Ukraine are by no means impressed by military exercises of 500 NATO servicemen in Poland. German Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier who also represents SPD has repeatedly pointed earlier to the necessity to seek for diplomatic ways of resolving the crisis in Ukraine. In particular he called for holding round tables with participation of Kiev authorities and federalization supporters. In addition the minister believes that representatives of Russia USA EU and Ukraine should in a four-party format make joint trips to the countrys west and east to hold a direct dialogue with the parties of the conflict. German experts share the view that possible economic sanctions would have a negative impact primarily on German economy itself. Trade volume between Germany and Russia in 2013 amounted to 76 billion about 6000 Germany-based enterprises are making business with Russian companies and the total volume of their investments makes 20 billion. About 3000 jobs in Germany depend on economic relations with Russia.

Water supply problem in Crimea to cost $247- 417 million - Kremlin aide The Ukrainian authorities reduced water supplies to Crimea last week alleging the peninsula owned Kiev a large sum for water Russias Crimea to repay $10 million debt to Ukrainian companies PETROZAVODSK April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. It will take 10-15 billion roubles ($247-417 million) to solve the problem of water supply to Crimea presidential aide Andrei Belousov said. Crimea can be independent in terms of water supply but it will cost 10-15 billion roubles ($247-417 million) he said on Monday April 28. One of the solutions would be supplying water from Russias southern Kuban region by building a pipeline. However Belousov said this would be an exotic option. Another solution would be drilling wells and using the existing water reservoirs. The Ukrainian authorities reduced water supplies to Crimea last week alleging the peninsula owned Kiev a large sum for water. However Crimean Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov said restrictions on the supply of water to Crimea were an act of sabotage on the part of Ukraine. Ukraines act of sabotage to limit the supply of water to the republic through the North Crimean Canal is nothing but a deliberate action against Crimeans he said. Aksyonov said negotiations are underway with Ukraine at the federal level to resolve the issue. There are backup plans. In any case Crimea will not be left without water. As for drinking water there are no problems with it he said. Russian government to provide subsidies for organizing transportation to/from Crimea The prime minister said that the Crimean authorities were engaged in negotiations with all agricultural producers who have been cut off from water supply from the North Crimean Canal. The rice situation is the worst. Crimea is redrawing the map of crop areas in regions where irrigation may not be available he said adding that alternative areas were being offered to agricultural producers. The federal budget is ready to compensate agricultural producers for possible losses Aksyonov said. He recalled that this issue had been discussed with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak. Special conditions have been created for Crimea. No one will be left without help the prime minister said. We are also considering an alternative plan for drilling wells and we are working on this day and night he added. Aksyonov stressed that the persons who have seized power in Ukraine including former residents of Crimea Senchenko and Kunitsyn are acting like enemies trying to cause their former fellow citizens harm. But they will get a proper assessment from the people of Crimea and will always be persona non-grata in the republic. Usually those who mischief hatch mischief catch he said. According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85% of fresh water from this canal which was built in 1961-1971. Crieman First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev said Kiev had no legal grounds for halting water supply. The Kiev junta has once again shown its real face he said. There is no and will be no shortage of drinking water in Crimea. But there will certainly be losses in agriculture. We cant say that the agricultural season has been wrecked but there will certainly be losses Temirgaliyev said. He said work was underway to draft a drip irrigation programme to save water. We hope it will be implemented by the next agricultural year he added.

Western sanctions against Russia not to affect rouble economy - Kremlin aide The stronger the sanctions are the tighter the elite will become. This is the main effect from the sanctions presidential aide Andrei Belousov PETROZAVODSK April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. New Western sanctions against Russia will have no negative impact on the rouble or economic growth presidential aide Andrei Belousov said. They (sanctions) are insignificant. There may be some short-lived effects but they are unlikely to have any serious annual impact Belousov said on Monday April 28. He believes that the new sanctions announced by the European Union and the United States earlier in the day will only consolidate the Russian elite. The stronger the sanctions are the tighter the elite will become. This is the main effect from the sanctions he said. In his opinion the mentality of Russian people is such that the stronger the external factors the more likely internal consolidation in the country. I think the sanctions will produce an effect: they will mobilise us even more. What our colleagues do not understand is that these sanctions have led to the tightest consolidation of the elite over the past 10-15 years the aide said.

Kiev authorities committing crime against own people says presidential candidate People used to come to Maidan [Kievs central Independence Square] to speak up for democracy and a better life against corruption of oligarchs and the authorities he said. Now we do not have more democracy. Some of Russian channels are banned in Ukraine journalists are detained political repression is underway army is engaged in a punitive operation against the people. Living standards are degrading and there are no conditions for their improvement he stressed. All that is going on is not what they promised to the people. That is why in his words Kiev is afraid that Ukraines central and western regions might follow the lead of the countrys southeast and arise. According to Tsariov the crisis in Ukraine could be resolved in just a few days if the Kiev authorities lend an ear to the demands of people living in southeastern regions of Ukraine. He said he had offered his candidature as a mediator between the authorities and protesters. There is a very simple way out of the current situation. I can speak with any protesters I am welcome everywhere he said. The authorities he stressed must show readiness to stop the army to take the troops back to their permanent garrisons to disband illegal armed groups to conduct amnesty and close cases against protesting officers of the riot police [Berkut] and to lend an ear to the demands about the status of the Russian language and the federalization of the country. To deescalate the conflict in his words the government should sit down at a roundtable and take a decision on amnesty and troops pullout. After that it must adopt a roadmap on amendments to be made to the constitution. We have out edition of the constitution and we are ready to present it to the government Tsariov said. It is much easier to try to reach an agreement than to kill own citizens he stressed. Earlier on Friday Tsariov said that the Kiev authorities were subordinate to the US administration. When in a span of two weeks the CIA director the US vice president and the head of the US Senate armed service committee pay visits to Kiev one has an impression that Ukraine is subordinate to the American administration he said. International cooperation is a good thing. But I dont want Ukraine to lose its political and economic independence he stressed.

Party of Regions: Russian language must be recognized as second official The matter is in the fact that Russian-speaking citizens account for at least 40% of the population in Ukraine Ukraine to hold early elections despite developments in eastern regions KIEV April  on recognition of Russian as the second official language in Ukraine is the unchanged position of the Party of Regions a parliament member and the secretary of the party's political board Boris Kolesnikov said on Thursday. "The position of the Party of Regions with regard to the Russian language has not been changed since 2003 we insist on its official status" he said. The matter is in the fact that Russian-speaking citizens account for at least 40% of the population in Ukraine. Therefore their interests must be protected in three main spheres education media and business communication Kolesnikov notes. Ukrainian Party of Regions refuses to vote in parliament until demands met "For example universities are maintained by all Ukrainian taxpayers. Some universities have the status of national but teach only in Ukrainian. It is violation of Russian-speaking citizens' rights isn't? Thus our voters are absolutely right to demand the official status for the Russian language" he said. As was reported earlier the regionals' leader in the parliament Oleksandr Yefremov said on Thursday that deputies from the party would not participate in voting in the parliament until their demands and demands of protesters in the country's eastern regions were met. People in Ukraine's eastern regions demand to recognize the Russian language as official and hold referendums to take important decisions Yefremov said. Until the issues were settled the group of the Party of Regions would not vote he stated.

No logic in Wests readiness to recognize elections in Ukraine but not in Syria Lavrov Moscow will recognize only those results in Ukraine that are based on a comprehensive process Russia's minister of foreign affairs said MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was no logic in the Wests readiness to recognize elections in Ukraine without constitutional reform while refusing to do the same in Syria. US not ready to admit it cant run the show around globe Sergei Lavrov They [the United States] said and unfortunately this was picked up by the UN spokesperson that the elections in Syria called by President Assad for June 3 will be illegitimate because a transitional governing body should be created first on the basis of a new constitution and so on Lavrov said in an interview with the Russia Today television channel on Wednesday April 23. The Geneva communiqu says that a transitional governing body should be created [in Syria] which will develop the constitutional reform as the basis for general elections. The same sequence of actions was stated in the agreement on Ukraine of February 21: at first a government of national unity then constitutional reform and only then after a new constitution elections he said. The people who have come to power [in Ukraine] and declared themselves a government did not speak about constitutional reform at all in the beginning and said that presidential elections would be held on May 25. When we reminded them that constitutional reform was their obligation as well and that until they carry it out the east and the south would not recognize the legitimacy of what they were doing they remembered their obligation but said they would do it later Lavrov said. The West believes that all this is absolutely legitimate. Those who said that the Syrian presidential elections would not be legitimate without constitutional reform have already practically recognized the legitimacy of the elections in Ukraine slated for May 25 without constitutional reform the minister said. OSCE says seeing no signs of de-escalation in eastern Ukrainian regions Lavrov: Russian troops stay on own territory take no steps against obligations Right Sector still active despite Geneva deals Sergei Lavrov However Moscow will recognize only those results in Ukraine that are based on a comprehensive process he said. Announcing elections before a consensus is reached with the east and south of Ukraine would be destructive for the country. They [the authorities] must prove with actions and do what they promised to do. They said constitutional reform would be carried out and the status of the Russian language would be discussed as the south-east is demanding and they must start the process that will guarantee that all Ukrainian regions feel comfortable and know that they are heard and engaged in this process as equal parties Lavrov said. Once this process is over when the reform is ready it must be submitted to a referendum he said. It makes no difference what it is called federalization or decentralization the minister said recalling US Secretary of State John Kerrys remarks at a press conference in Geneva that Ukrainian regions would get autonomy. We want to be confident that the interests of the regions are taken into account that they decide their own fate within the state that respects their interests regarding the language culture history traditions heroes and their right to interact with their foreign neighbors Lavrov said noting that there were very many inter-regional ties between Russia and Ukraine. They [regions] want to elect their own leaders they want to keep more taxes for the development of their regions rather than give them all to Kiev and then wait for its handouts he said.

Candidate for Ukraines presidency urges Kiev to stop using army for suppressing protests Mykhailo Dobkin also called upon the opposition and the Kiev authorities to pass a memorandum on mutual understanding as soon as possible KHARKIV April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraines authorities must stop immediately the use of Army units for the suppression of protests in the east of the country Mykhailo Dobkin a candidate for the post of president in the May 25 election representing the Party of Regions said Thursday at a session of the Kharkiv Regional Council. Aggressive rhetoric is coming from the Kiev officials more and more often Dobkin said. They call some people patriots and dismiss others as a horde he said. Authorities claim that some Ukrainians have died for the countrys freedom while others have died for God only knows what. The most aggressive representatives of the Kiev government feel free to do whatever they wish to and thats why I believe weve been absolutely right to include an immediate renunciation of the use of Army units as an instrument to suppressing protests in the East into the list of our demands Dobkin said. Dobkin also called upon the opposition and the Kiev authorities to pass a memorandum on mutual understanding as soon as possible. Kiev authorities should make first step toward national reconciliation Lavrov Ukraine to hold early elections despite developments in eastern regions Ukrainian Party of Regions refuses to vote in parliament until demands met Speaking at a plenary session of the Kharkiv regional council Dobkin suggested putting the memorandum into parliamentarians appeal as to priority measures on decentralization a higher role of local governments a constitutional reform and stabilization of social and political situation in the country. We want that the authorities listen at last to the opposition and sign a memorandum on mutual understanding that will help de-escalate tension in the country the head of the Party of Regions faction in the Kharkov regional council said. Today this attempt failed once again. On technicalities what the government offers is a set of phrases and nothing concrete. What the opposition factions suggest has an absolutely clear message and proposals that can be put into practice he said. Compromises must be made. One can use force to drive people away from a seized city council but one cannot change peoples mind and make them like and respect the present authorities Dobkin said. The Kiev government launched an active phase of the punitive operation near the city of Slavyansk in the Donetsk region Thursday morning. Armored vehicles are being brought into the area and snipers are occupying combat positions. Officials at the Interior Ministry in Kiev claim in the meantime that five protesters have been killed in the course of the armed standoff.

Russia EC Ukraine meeting ahead for gas talks EU envoy EU commissioner offers Russia Ukraine energy chiefs to have tripartite gas talks BRUGES April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Russia the European Commission and Ukraine are set to hold talks on problems over gas supplies to Ukraine Russia's Ambassador to the EU Vladimir Chizhov told an international conference on EU energy policy. It would not be quite honest and wise to expect that problems Ukraine is facing could be settled through efforts of Russia or the Russian Gazprom company he said. Ukraines gas debt has already exceeded $2.2 billion. Russia has once again postponed switching to advance payments for gas which is envisaged in the contract between Gazprom and (Ukraines state energy company) Naftogaz Chizhov added. "We expect that consultations between Russia the European Commission and Ukraine will take place shortly to produce a solution to this complex and critical situation he said. Consultations were due on Thursday in Bratislava Slovakia where energy agency heads of the EU Ukraine and Slovakia were to meet on reverse gas supplies. Chizhov told ITAR-TASS however that the European Commission was not ready for consultations with Russia's participation. He said EU Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger had sent a letter to Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak signaling European Commission's intention to organize such a meeting but specifying neither the timeframe nor the venue.

Donetsk mayor proposes to put off referendum on regions status to May 25 KIEV April 23./ITAR-TASS/. Mayor of Ukraines much-troubled eastern city of Donetsk Alexander Lukyanchenko has come up with a proposal to put off a referendum on the status of the region from May 11 to May 25 and to combine it with the presidential election. He said there would be no grounds for considering the plebiscite legitimate otherwise as the authorities in Kiev had not adopted the law on local referendums yet. Lukyanchenko said however that legislative duplicities could be avoided if the referendum were synchronized with the presidential election. It would then be held under the supervision of numerous international organizations and anyone would scarcely question its legitimacy then he said. In addition we could avoid unnecessary excessive costs then. To hold the referendum a total of 426 polling stations should be set up just the same number of electoral commissions Lukyanchenko said. Earlier he proposed to hold an all-Ukraine voting on a new Constitution simultaneously with the election of the president. Protesters in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions demand that local referendums be held May 11.

Duma to consider in autumn amendments to law on retailers cost saving MOSCOW April 27 /ITAR-TASS/. The State Duma lower house of Russias parliament in autumn will return to the consideration of amendments to legislation that are aimed at cost saving for retailers RF First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview to the Rossiya 24 news television channel. We promised to the retail store networks that we will help them for example to write off the networks costs related to theft. Representatives of retail store networks say that the meagre percentage to which they are entitled under Russian legislation (retailers are allowed to include less than one percent from the proceeds in the sum related to products losses due to theft) is totally inadequate it is different from that of the EU countries and the United States Shuvalov said. In addition he noted retailers are dissatisfied with the requirement to maintain the trade outlets infrastructure and render an account of it in a manner that differs from the foreign practice. The request this kind of interaction from us and we are ready to provide it. But we say: please show us your progress regarding how you interact with food producers how you eliminate these malpractices that are forced on you by the suppliers of products and how you use the dispute resolution mechanism. So as soon as we see this progress in reality we will certainly respond the first deputy prime minister said. We have arranged with the State Duma security committee and economy committee to suspend so far these bills that are in favour of the retail store networks and return to this issue in autumn and see the current practice of interaction with food producers. If anything has changed for the better or not and then we will introduce certain benefits for them which in essence will mean spending from the regional budgets. Because they ask for certain benefits and will pay less taxes Shuvalov said. He stressed that the RF government and State Duma were ready to meet the retail store networks halfway only if they start to develop competitive relations and that there will be no cartels no collusions that food producers will have the possibility to come to retail networks and without any exactions additional forced services to supply their products for sale.

NEW YORK April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. Former Prime Minister and Batkivshchina (Fatherland) party leader Yulia Timoshenko said Ukraine must be a member of NATO even though a large part of people has many times spoken against this. In an interview with The Associated Press excerpts from which were published on Saturday April 26 Timoshenko who is running for presidency in Ukraine spoke of a fundamental change in public thinking following the latest events in the east of the country and Russias actions. She believes that the mentality of Ukrainians has changed as has the strategic course of the country. NATO is the best choice for Ukraine she said. The Associated Press said Timoshenko had previously not supported the idea of Ukraines membership in NATO. Timoshenko is confident that no Third World War will start over the events in Ukraine and believes that the world will not allow World War III. She also welcomed a new round of sanctions on Russia. Also Timoshenkohas urged her competitor Pyotr Poroshenko to revoke his proposal for talks with Russia. I want to stress once again that Pyotr Poroshenkos proposal to the Russian Federation that Russia should determine the place and time of the talks is unacceptable. The negotiation process being conducted in the EU-US-Ukraine-Russia format may not be broken Timoshenko said in a statement published on her partys official website on Saturday April 26. If any of the politicians breaks the negotiation process now and breaks the tough sanctions imposed upon Russia this will practically legalise the occupation of Crimea and acceptance of Russias ultimatums she said adding This will basically mean capitulation. Timoshenko urged Poroshenko not to break the negotiation process and to withdraw the proposal for a transition to such unclear bilateral negotiations. On Friday April 25 Poroshenko speaking at the Ukraine-Russia: Dialogue congress asked Moscow to name the place and time for talks while accusing Russia of being unwilling to implement the Geneva accord of April 17 which calls for de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine. Tycoon Pyotr Poroshenko is enjoying the biggest support among the constituencies according to public opinion polls published this week. They indicate that 32.9% of respondents are ready to vote for him in the upcoming presidential elections slated for May 25. Timoshenko is second and trailing far behind with 9.5% followed by MP Sergei Tigipko. In early April Poroshenko replying to a question whether Kiev wanted to join NATO urgently said No this does not depend on us; this depends on the organisation itself. We can feel that there is no consensus among its member countries on this issue. As president I would like to conduct negotiations with our neighbours about new alliances or additional security possibilities he said.

Russia's minister of foreign affairs urged the United States to use its influence to make the Kiev authorities assume responsibility for the current developments in Ukraine Putin: If Kiev starts to use army against people inside country this is serious crime MOSCOW April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. Stopping the unlawful actions of the Kiev authorities is the main condition for resolving the current crisis in Ukraine Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. We believe that the main condition for resolving the crisis in Ukraine is to stop the unlawful actions of the Kiev authorities who must realize their responsibility for everything that was written down [in Kiev] on February 21 and in Geneva on April 17. It says clearly that there must be no violence. The use of the army with the support of radical nationalists against the people is an absolutely unacceptable form of violence. Moreover I think this is a criminal decision he said. It [the agreement] also speaks of the need to disarm these national radicals after all and calls for fighting terrorism religious intolerance and anti-Semitism the minister said. It also says that a truly comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue must be started. We see none of this happening. Kiev authorities should make first step toward national reconciliation Lavrov Lavrov urged the United States to use its influence to make the Kiev authorities assume responsibility for the current developments in Ukraine. I have no doubt that our American partners can influence the people who have proclaimed themselves a government in Kiev. The anti-terror operation was announced immediately after the behind-the-scene visit to Kiev by the CIA director and the Easter break in this operation announced by Kiev was broken right after [US] Vice President Joe Bidens visit there. By the way Joe Biden met with the leadership of the country basically as a head of state holding an internal meeting. He sat at the head of the table with Ukrainian officials flanking him on both sides the minister said. I am convinced that our American colleagues can and should use their influence to make the present Kiev authorities not just realize but fulfill their responsibility for what is happening Lavov said.

Earlier on Wednesday Yarosh said Sector had moved its headquarters from Kiev to Dnepropetrovsk. "It's easier to monitor the situation in Donbass from Dnepropetrovsk" he said. Local media reported a meeting in camera between Yarosh and head of the Dnepropetrovsk regional administration Igor Kolomoisky. The Right Sector leader denied receiving funding from oligarchs. "We're not using oligarchs' money in politics but when a war is on we do not object to their funding the army" he said. On Wednesday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Right Sector despite the Geneva accords remained quite active. "We agreed in Geneva that any violence should be stopped" the diplomat said. "But the next day  acting President/ Turchinov ordered the army to shoot at unarmed people participating in peaceful protests. In Geneva we also agreed that extremists should be disarmed but Right Sector is still active." In Russia the Investigative Committee opened a criminal case against Yarosh on charges of public calls for terrorist and extremist activities which he had made through mass media. Yarosh was put on the international wanted list. Moscow's Basmanny court sanctioned his arrest in absentia.

Presidential candidate: situation in Ukraine can be settled in 2 days MOSCOW April 26//ITAR-TASS/. The crisis in Ukraine can be settled in a matter of two days presidential candidate and MP Oleg Tsarev said on Saturday April 26. The country can be saved and a war avoided. Its easy to do. It can be done in two days. The government simply needs to begin negotiations with us Tsarev told the Russian TVC television channels Pravo Znat (The Right to Know) programme to be aired on Saturday evening. The main point is to stop the war that is advancing on Ukraine he said. At the same time he believes that the [incumbent] authorities are showing no willingness to implement the Geneva agreement. The authorities are continuing arrests and repressions. The troops are surrounding small towns in the east. And I am seriously concerned that a mop-up [operation] will begin and blood will be spilled. This will forever separate the Southeast from Ukraine Tsarev said. In this situation one can only pin hopes on people. Ukrainians do not want to kill each other. All hopes are pinned on the people. They are sabotaging the war he said. Tsarev said assertions alleging that Russia is playing a role in the situation in the southeast of Ukraine were wrong. I personally know the people who are participating in the protest movement. I can see neither Russian money nor Russian aid nor Russian security services involved there he said. Early presidential elections in Ukraine are slated for May 25. Twenty-three candidates have qualified to compete for the presidency. Nine of them were nominated by political parties. Tsarev is an independent candidate a former member of the Party of Regions who offered on April 19 to mediate in the resolution of the crisis in the Southeast of Ukraine. He advocates cooperation with Russia official status for the Russian language and common history of the two countries.

By making this decision the United States was guided by absolutely distorted and unfounded perceptions regarding the events in Ukraine and around it Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov says MOSCOW April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. The unilateral sanctions against Russia imposed by the United States are illegitimate and run counter to the rules of civilised communication Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. We strongly condemn the announced set of measures aimed at trying to put pressure on Russia by means of sanctions. Unilateral exterritorial sanctions are illegitimate in nature. Not only do they not conform to the norms of civilised interstate communication and the practice of international relations but they also run counter to international law the diplomat told ITAR-TASS on Monday April 28. By making this decision the United States was guided by absolutely distorted and unfounded perceptions regarding the events in Ukraine and around it. Washington is pouring oil on the flames but has done nothing has not taken even one step to bring its proteges in Kiev to their senses. The new attempt at diktat and ultimatum undertaken by America against us will add no chance for a constructive resolution of the problems. The demands the protesters are putting forth in the eastern regions of Ukraine are absolutely legitimate. Instead of exerting pressure and making attempts to impose certain solutions the United States should get preoccupied with more intensive and substantive work with its clients in Kiev in order to normalise the situation Ryabkov said. USA publishes sanctions list with several Russian and Ukrainian officials US State Department restricts sale of defense products to Russia EU has published a list of 21 sanctioned Russian and Crimean officials EU expands black list of Russians and cancels EU-Russia summit in June Unfortunately we have to talk not only about sanctions against certain Russian individuals and companies but also about the revival of the seemingly bygone practice of restrictions on normal high-tech cooperation. Washington is basically restoring COCOM the Cold War-era method of limiting normal cooperation thus driving itself into the darkest and dustiest corner of the past epoch. This is not a 21st century policy. This is a reflection of the fact that people remain trapped by their own phantoms and perceptions and probably nostalgia for the long-gone world the diplomat said. Once again we can see that these steps are being taken by those who determine the Russian policy in the United States out of their own helplessness. They will certainly not achieve the goals they are seeking. The situation will deteriorate. We will respond and this will not be our choice. But we cannot leave this without reaction practical reaction based on our own decisions. The US behavior is becoming challenging in this respect Ryabkov said.

Right Sector still active despite Geneva deals Sergei Lavrov The Geneva Statement in particular envisions that all illegal armed formations should be disarmed in Ukraine MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. The Right Sector far-right ultranationalist Ukrainian group is still active despite agreements reached in Geneva last week Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday. US not ready to admit it cant run the show around globe Sergei Lavrov In Geneva [we] agreed that any violence should be stopped Lavrov said in an interview with RT television channel. However on the next day [Ukrainian parliament-appointed acting president Alexander] Turchynov ordered the army to shoot at unarmed people taking part in peaceful protests. In Geneva [we] also agreed on disarmament of extremists but the Right Sector is still rather active he said. The Geneva Statement adopted after last Thursdays meeting on Ukraine that involved Russia the United States the European Union and Ukraine in particular envisions that all illegal armed formations should be disarmed in Ukraine all administrative buildings unblocked and all protesters except for those who committed serious crimes pardoned. The new regime should start releasing political prisoners and implementing the agreements reached on February 21 which require among other things the surrender of illegal held arms. The authorities must disarm the Right Sector and they must stop making empty promises that all regions will be engaged in the constitutional reform Lavrov said in an interview with the Russia Today television channel on Wednesday April 23. He noted that the purpose of the agreement signed by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the opposition on February 21 was to make Yanukovych assume an obligation not to use police and not to declare a state of emergency. We can say that it was a capitulation. Everything he promised was done. Some say that he did not sign a law restoring the previous constitution but this law entered into force anyway. Therefore all of the oppositions demands were met Lavrov said adding that the opposition failed to keep its word. The purpose of the Geneva agreement of April 17 was to try to put the process back on track including constitutional reform that will engage all regions on an equal basis. Unfortunately the agreement has not been implemented by those who must take the first step the minister said. People need real actions. They are fed up with empty promises and are waiting for the order allowing the use of army against civilians to be cancelled Lavrov said. Russia surprised by distorted interpretation of Geneva statement by Kiev Right Sector actions threaten Geneva deals implementation - Russian FM Ukraine saw a coup and new people were brought to power amid riots in February whom Moscow does not recognize as Ukraine's legitimate leaders. The crisis deteriorated when Crimea where most residents are Russians refused to recognize the legitimacy of the self-proclaimed Ukrainian leaders and reunified with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which it overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. After Crimeas incorporation by Russia protests against the new Kiev authorities erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern regions with demonstrators seizing some government buildings and demanding referendums on the countrys federalization.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that the operation in Ukraines eastern region was not aimed against Russia or Russian-speaking citizens. This operation is geared to protect civilians the ministry claimed. Earlier on Friday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that what Kievs current authorities were doing today was a punitive action and a crime against their own people. The so-called Easter ceasefire was disrupted the foreign minister said. The counter-terrorist operation has been resumed. What the Kiev authorities are doing today is just a punitive operation which already resulted in many victims. About 160 tanks 250 armoured infantry vehicles and other hardware and aircraft are used to fight against own people.

China not ready to buy more Russian gas above 38 bcm being discussed MOSCOW April 23./ITAR-TASS/. Russias Gazprom is ready to supply more gas to China than the two sides are discussing but the buyer is not prepared to purchase extra volumes Viktor Timoshilov who is in charge of the companys eastern projects said on Wednesday April 23. We are negotiating with China for the supply of 38 billion cubic metres of gas eastward even though we could supply more but the buyer is not prepared to confirm the purchase of larger volumes he said. The sides are negotiating supplies in the amount of 38 billion cubic metres even though previously a figure of 60 billion cubic metres was discussed. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said after a meeting with Zhou Jiping Chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) in early April that the next round of talks would be held at the end of the month. At the meeting the parties addressed the issues of arranging Russian pipeline gas supply to China. Miller and Zhou achieved considerable progress on a contract being hammered out to supply gas via the eastern route in accordance with the previously agreed Major Terms. At this round of talks we approved all the project-related technical matters. We advanced in our talks on the gas price. The parties agreed that the contract would come into force before the end of 2014 and that the next round of talks would take place in Moscow in late April Miller said summarising the meeting results. Gazprom may sign a contract for the supply of natural gas to China during President Vladimir Putins visit to Beijing in May of this year the company said in January after a meeting between Miller and Zhou. Both sides are interested in the successful completion of the talks and are determined to sign the contract as soon as possible it was proposed at the meeting that the contract should be ready for signing during the Russian presidents visit to China scheduled for May of this year the statement said. The parties noted that the negotiations were progressing as per schedule and the contract would enter into force in accordance with the previously agreed Major Terms until late 2014. In March 2013 the two companies signed a memorandum on pipeline gas supplies from Russia to China using the eastern route. Miller said back then that gas supplies to China could be prepaid. Given the cost of the gas transportation system to the Chinese border preliminarily appraised at 770 billion roubles an advance payment could be as big as 25 billion U.S. dollars. In June 2013 CNPC came up with new pricing proposals suggesting that the price of gas be pegged to the value of Henry Hub liquefied natural gas. But Gazprom said it was not ready to do that. The eastern route is an extension from the Sila Sibiri (The Force of Siberia) gas pipeline. The main parameters of supplies are: crossing point in Blagoveshchensk; volume of supply 38 billion cubic metres with a possible increase to 60 billion cubic metres; start of supply 2018. Over the past 10 years natural gas consumption in China has increased from 24 billion to 100 billion cubic metres a year. There are several possible routes for bringing gas to China. Gazprom insisted that Russian gas be initially supplied to China via the western route. China insisted that gas be initially supplied by the eastern route which it believes will reduce the cost of Russian gas supplies. At this point the cost of Russian gas deliveries including transportation is close to Chinas offer of 250 U.S. dollars per 1000 cubic metres. The western route is the Altai gas transportation system that will supply gas from Gazproms gas fields. The eastern route can deliver gas from fields in Eastern Siberia and Sakhalin. The agreement on strategic cooperation between Gazprom and CNPC was signed on October 14 2004. In June 2009 the governments of Russia and China signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation in the field of natural gas. CNPC is China's largest petroleum company wholly-owned by the state and is one of the world's leading integrated oil and gas production companies. In 2009 Gazprom and CNPC inked the Framework Agreement on the major terms and conditions of natural gas supply from Russia to China. The Agreement stipulates annual exports of up to 68 billion cubic meters of gas to the Chinese market. In 2010 the Extended Major Terms of natural gas supply from Russia to China were signed.

Lavrov Kerry state 92 prc of chemicals removed from Syria MOSCOW April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation on Saturday April 26 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that 92% of chemical material had been removed from Syria up to date. The Joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has confirmed delivery of a further shipment of chemical weapons material which has brought the total of chemical material removed and destroyed in country to 92.5% I welcome the significant progress of the last three weeks and I strongly encourage the Syrian authorities to conclude the removal operations as part of their efforts to achieve the 30 June 2014 deadline. Particular thanks goes to Member States for their steadfast support U.N./OPCW Joint Mission Special Coordinator Sigrid Kaag. In addition to the removal operations the Syrian authorities have destroyed buildings equipment and empty mustard gas containers and decontaminated other containers in a number of chemical weapons storage and production sites. A majority of these sites are now closed. Kaag said on April 22 that the removal of chemicals from Syria would be completed within the next few days. This will contribute to meeting the deadlines set by the OPCW Executive Council including the June 30 2014 target date for completing the destruction of Syrias entire chemical weapons programme. The renewed pace in movements is positive and necessary to ensure progress towards a tight deadline she said. According to the OPCW no chemical weapons will be left in Syria by April 27. They will be destroyed by Britain Germany the United States and Finland. When all of the Syrian chemicals from all storage sites have been loaded aboard the Danish and Norwegian cargo ships they will be transported to various locations for destruction under the verification of OPCW inspectors. The majority of Priority 1 chemicals will be neutralised at sea aboard the U.S. vessel MV Cape Ray while a smaller amount will be neutralised at a land-based facility in Ellesmere Port UK. The Priority 2 chemicals will be destroyed at commercial facilities in the U.S. and Finland. A facility in Germany will dispose of part of the effluent from the Cape Ray operations the OPCW said. The Syrian Government informed the Joint Mission of a revised plan for removing all relevant chemicals from its territory by April 27. The amended plan was considered by the OPCW Executive Council in The Hague in early March 7. Western countries were concerned that the delays would not allow Syria to destroy all of its chemical weapons by June 30 2014 as was initially planned and it will need a delay of several months. The removal of the most critical material for destruction began on January 7 2014 a week after the deadline for its completion set by an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States under which Syria renounced its chemical weapons material and joined 1992 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons. On November 15 2013 the OPCW Executive Council (EC) approved a detailed plan of destruction to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons stockpile. In the plan Syrian chemical weapons will be transported for destruction outside its territory to ensure their destruction in the safest and soonest manner and no later than June 30 2014. Under Security Council Resolution 2118 (2013) and decisions of the OPCW Executive Council Syrias entire chemical weapons programme is to be destroyed by June 30 2014. Syria renounced its chemical weapons material and joined 1992 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development Production Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons under an agreement brokered last year by Russia and the United States.

Russia surprised by distorted interpretation of Geneva statement by Kiev The Kiev authorities are doing nothing not moving a finger to eliminate the causes of the current deep crisis in Ukraine Sergei Lavrov said MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow is surprised by the distorted interpretation of the Geneva statement by the Kiev authorities and their American partners the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. The statement says that all illegal armed groups must be disarmed. However instead of taking effective measures to implement this agreement Kiev and Washington and some European capitals keep talking about the need to surrender arms only by Ukrainian citizens who are defending their rights in the southeast of Ukraine while turning a blind eye to the continuing provocations by militants from ultra-right forces specifically the so-called Right Sector both in Kiev and different cities in the South and East of the country which resulted in the loss of human life on the night to April 20 the ministry said. Russia continues to believe in the seriousness of our Western partners when they speak about their commitment to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the political crisis in Ukraine. However fact alas prove otherwise. We are still waiting for Kiev to fulfill its promises as it is responsible for fostering dialogue with Ukrainian regions including in the South-East the ministry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier this week urged Kiev to cancel orders on use of army against the population to disarm Right Sector militants and other ultranationalist groups release protesters in the south-eastern regions from detention and stop their prosecution and launch a comprehensive constitutional reform by taking real steps not by making declarations. Lavrov said that the Ukrainian authorities were not complying with the Geneva agreement. Joseph Biden: Russia should join OSCE mission in eastern Ukraine The Kiev authorities are doing nothing not moving a finger to eliminate the causes of the current deep crisis in Ukraine Lavrov said. The Right Sector has been running things in different cities in central and western Ukraine for almost half a year trying to spread its influence to the eastern regions by force he said. Buildings in Kiev which were seized by force at the start of the events in Ukraine have not been vacated the streets have not been unblocked and the Maidan [general term meaning public protests against the authorities] continues to boom excuse the term. The leaders appointed by the Verkhovna Rada [parliament] are saying openly that the Geneva agreement does not apply to the Maidan because the Kiev City Council or city administration has made the decision that the Maidan may stay on and that it is legitimate. This is absolutely unacceptable the minister said. The Geneva meeting on the situation in Ukraine on April 17 agreed on initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security for all citizens. All sides must refrain from any violence intimidation or provocative actions. The participants strongly condemned and rejected all expressions of extremism racism and religious intolerance including anti-Semitism. All illegal armed groups must be disarmed; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners; all illegally occupied streets squares and other public places in Ukrainian cities and towns must be vacated. Amnesty will be granted to protestors and to those who have left buildings and other public places and surrendered weapons with the exception of those found guilty of capital crimes. It was agreed that the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission should play a leading role in assisting Ukrainian authorities and local communities in the immediate implementation of these de-escalation measures wherever they are needed most beginning in the coming days. The USA EU and Russia commit to support this mission in particular by providing observers. The announced constitutional process will be inclusive transparent and accountable. It will include the immediate establishment of a broad national dialogue with outreach to all of Ukraines regions and political constituencies and allow for the consideration of public comments and proposed amendments. The participants underlined the importance of economic and financial stability in Ukraine and would be ready to discuss additional support as the above steps are implemented.

Putin: Sanctions may benefit Russian economy but MasterCard Visa made mistake "By acting the way they are acting in Russia they are undermining trust in themselves and therefore will certainly lose the market" the Russian president added ST. PETERSBURG April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. Economic sanctions may benefit Russia by helping de-offshorize its economy and create better conditions for doing business inside the country President Vladimir Putin said. Many people who take their savings and business to low-tax areas are already thinking whether it would be better to carry out all of their economic activities including registration at home the president said at the Media Forum on Thursday April 24. As for de-offshorization the Russian authorities are facing many important and necessary tasks to create better conditions for doing business inside the country he said. This means the tax system its stability rates the fight against excessive bureaucratization and corruption and many other things. Putin believes that sanctions will also prod the Russian authorities into working harder and taking measures to strengthen the sovereignty of the national economy by creating a national payment system or drafting a law on enhanced sovereignty in strategic industries. The world is globalizing and the economy and politics are closely interdependent but excessive dependence leads to the loss of sovereignty Putin said with regret and cited the countrys gold and currency reserves as an example. Some countries with large gold and currency reserves diversify them one way or another he added. We did not create our own settlement system as Japan or China did and this makes us completely dependent on our partners the president said. We have always believed that our partners both Visa and MasterCard are depoliticized economic entities and companies. However as it turned out they too are under strong political pressure and influence and give in to it right away he said. Operators of international payment systems must be brought to senses - Medvedev Experts: Russia needs 2-3 years to create national payment system Creation of Russia nationwide payment system to take 2-6 months Sberbank chief Putin intends to open account in US sanctioned bank Rossiya Putin to get salary through bank Rossiya that fell under US sanctions From the economic point of view this is a big mistake because MasterCard and Visa control 90% of the Russian market which we gave to them of our own free will and all payments inside the country go through these systems and to a large extent through serves located in the United States. But thats nonsense! Why did Japan do it and can use a national payment system now but we are using their [American] systems inside the country I am not saying abroad where you go on a business trip or vacation Putin said This is a very big business for these companies. By acting the way they are acting in Russia they are undermining trust in themselves and therefore will certainly lose the market he said. At the same time he noted that the Russian authorities were not planning any retaliatory sanctions against MasterCard or Visa. However not only have we thought about it but we have also started creating our own national payment system Putin said. Putin said in March that Russia would create its own payment system. These systems work successfully in such countries as Japan and China. They started off as national systems for domestic needs only but are now becoming increasingly popular he said. The Japanese system now operates in 200 countries. Why shouldnt we do the same? We should and we will Putin said at a meeting with the leadership of the Federation Council the upper house of parliament. The Central Bank of Russia is already making plans for creating a national payment system in the country. We should create a system that will ensure uninterrupted domestic payments that make up about 90 percent of the total. We are preparing measures that should be realistic easy and gradual. At the initial stage we should ensure technological compatibility between processing and operating centers of major banks so that they could switch over quickly Central Bank Chair Elvira Nabiullina said. A draft law ensuring uninterrupted money transfers within Russia will go to the State Duma lower house of parliament shortly. It bans all participants from terminating transfers unilaterally. Clearing centers will not be allowed to provide information about money transfers outside the country or make such information accessible from other countries. In 2011 several MPs called for creating a domestic processing centre. The relevant law was adopted but processing operations were not transferred to Russia despite the risk of losing access to international payment systems for Russian banks. This is precisely what happened on March 21 2014 when Visa and MasterCard both headquartered in the United States suspended operations for several Russian banks. The blocking of access to the SWIFT inter-bank payment system makes online payments in any currency except the national one impossible. Presidential adviser Sergei Glazyev suggests creating a single processing centre for payments within the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Customs Union created by Belarus Kazakhstan and Russia.

OSCE refutes Ukrainian foreign ministers allegations about secr-gens visit to Kiev KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has refuted allegations of Ukraines parliament-appointed Foreign Minister Andrei Deshchitsa that OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier was arriving in Kiev later on Sunday. The OSCE press service told Itar-Tass that the organizations secretary general was not coming to Kiev. Earlier on Sunday Deshchitsa said that Lamberto Zannier would come to Kiev late on Sunday. The situation over the release of OSCE observers [in Slavyansk] remains difficult he said. I am returning to Kiev. OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier is coming to Kiev in the evening too. Also on Sunday members of the group of international military observers from OSCE took part in a news conference in Slavyansk. One of them said the observers were not captives but guests of Mayor Ponomarev. On Friday April 25 supporters of federalization in Slavyansk a city in the southeast of Ukraine detained a bus with passengers with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities. The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures.

Palestinians' legitimate aspirations cant be fulfilled without consolidation - FM MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow welcomes practical steps to reset the process of Palestinian reconciliation the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. It described as important the visit to Gaza by a Palestinian delegation from the West Bank that began on April 22. The delegation led by a Fatah Central Committee member Azzam al-Ahmad met with HAMAS leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh. The two sides agreed to form a Palestinian technocratic government and hold general elections in keeping with the understanding reached earlier the ministry said. We regard this as a step in the right direction. Moscow has always adhered to the opinion that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people cannot be fulfilled and a fair and lasting settlement between Israel and Palestine on the well-known international legal basis cannot be achieved without the consolidation of Palestinian ranks on the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] and the Arab Peace Initiative platform the ministry said.

KIEV April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry alleged that the "presence of army units in the east of the country is solely aimed at the protection of citizens." In a press release on Wednesday the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said it believed "Russia should immediately move away" its troops from the border with Ukraine. Meanwhile Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with the RT news channel on Wednesday that "we never denied that we moved additional troops on the border just like Ukrainian authorities moved their troops closer to the Russian border because they moved them to the east and south regions. He also stressed that Russia had been conducting military exercises in different regions of the country on a regular basis since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister. The only thing I would like to highlight at this stage is that the Russian troops are on the Russian territory the requests for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document 2011 and under the treaty of the Open Sky they all have been granted he said. The inspectors visited the areas of deployment of the troops participating in the training exercises No one who participated in the inspections including the Americans Ukrainians and Europeans ever brought up any fact which would indicate that Russia was engaged in some dangerous military activity Lavrov said. "We are on our territory" Lavrov said underlining that Russia was not engaged in any military activity that did not fall under international law. "Ukrainian troops are also on the territory of their country but the difference is that they have an order allowing to use weapons against civilians. It's a criminal order" he said.

Russia to take all steps to free detained OSCE observers VIENNA April 26 (Itar-Tass) - Detention of military observers from European countries near Slavyansk in Ukraine's Donetsk region hampers de-escalation of the conflict believes Andrei Kelin Russia's permanent representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia was ready to assist to free them he told reporters on Saturday. "We believe the people must be freed as soon as possible" he said. "Russia as an OSCE member will take all possible steps for it." "We do not know circumstances of what happened to them and where they are now but we as other members of the organization are deeply concerned over the incident" the diplomat added. "If they are detained it will not contribute to defusing of tension at the site and will not help de-escalate the conflict." Ukraine invited a group of observers in March in accordance with the Vienna document and responsible for their safety were those who invited the Ukrainian authorities he noted. As is known from media observers made a bold attempt to go to the zone where the situation was extremely tense and residents in the Donetsk region were on alert expecting an army operation to begin at any moment against peaceful protesters the Russian diplomat noted.

Russia had never said it had already refused to accept the poll results Russian lawmaker says Russian delegation not to participate in June PACE session - Russian lawmaker MOSCOW April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Kiev authorities' behaviour towards candidates they oppose reinforces doubt about the forthcoming presidential election head of the foreign affairs committee in Russias State Duma lower house of parliament Alexei Pushkov told a news briefing on Thursday. Russia had never said it had already refused to accept the poll results. But it had strong doubts about whether the election scheduled for May 25 could be considered open legitimate and democratic Pushkov said. The actions that Kiev radicals take regarding all the other undesired candidates strengthen these doubts he added. Key to events was the attitude of Ukrainians who were against the current government. If those who stand against Kiev's authorities ignore the forthcoming election it will be very difficult for Russia to accept the poll results as correct and democratic Pushkov said. East Ukraine tension mirrors mistrust of Kiev leaders OSCE head says Shoigu: 11000 servicemen involved in operation against civilians in Ukraines southeast Ukraine to hold early elections despite developments in eastern regions A total of 23 people were registered by Ukraines Central Election Commission to run for the countrys presidency.

Other candidates including tycoon Petro Poroshenko are self-nominees.

Donetsk mayor proposes to put off referendum on regions status to May 25 KIEV April 23./ITAR-TASS/. Mayor of Ukraines much-troubled eastern city of Donetsk Alexander Lukyanchenko has come up with a proposal to put off a referendum on the status of the region from May 11 to May 25 and to combine it with the presidential election. He said there would be no grounds for considering the plebiscite legitimate otherwise as the authorities in Kiev had not adopted the law on local referendums yet. Lukyanchenko said however that legislative duplicities could be avoided if the referendum were synchronized with the presidential election. It would then be held under the supervision of numerous international organizations and anyone would scarcely question its legitimacy then he said. In addition we could avoid unnecessary excessive costs then. To hold the referendum a total of 426 polling stations should be set up just the same number of electoral commissions Lukyanchenko said. Earlier he proposed to hold an all-Ukraine voting on a new Constitution simultaneously with the election of the president. Protesters in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions demand that local referendums be held May 11.

Lavrov: Russia insisting on investigation of reports on Greystones involvement in Urkaine He said the military observers by the OSCE had admitted the absence of any evidence of the presence of Russian military observers in eastern Ukraine MOSCOW April 23./ITAR-TASS/. Russia insists on investigation of reports on involvement of the U.S. private military organization Greystone in the current events in Ukraine Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday in an interview with the Russia Today television channel. He said the military observers dispatched to Ukraine by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) had admitted the absence of any evidence of the presence of Russian military observers in eastern Ukraine. They noted only a possibility of the presence there of some kind of military advisers but he said they should continue watching the situation to understand the situation better. The only fact the Americans made references to was that the fighters (in eastern Ukraine - Itar-Tass) was the people there were using the weapons of Russian manufacture but everyone in Ukraine uses Russian weaponry for instance the Kalashnikov assault rifle or the Makarov handgun Lavrov said. This means a proof of this sort can scarcely be called sufficient. He also said reports had come several days ago on discovery of a cache with U.S. weaponry in Ukraine adding: This should necessarily be investigated. Lavrov recalled that the Russian side had raised the problem during contacts with U.S. counterparts. Some reports said several hundred specialists from the private military company Greystone had arrived Ukraine from the U.S. he said. Also reports said foreigners had been involved in several accidents. Americans told us they didnt have any information on this and then they said they had referred the question directly to Greystone and the organization had denied any involvement on its part. Still wed like to know who is doing certain things because there are too many deflections of reality otherwise if you use the language of diplomacy Lavrov said.

Kiev has no legal grounds for halting water supply to Crimea - deputy premier SIMFEROPOL April 26 22:19 /ITAR-TASS/. Kiev has no legal grounds for halting water supply to Crimea its First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev told ITAR-TASS on Saturday April 26. The Kiev junta has once again shown its real face he said. There is no and will be no shortage of drinking water in Crimea. But there will certainly be losses in agriculture. We cant say that the agricultural season has been wrecked but there will certainly be losses Temirgaliyev said. He said work was underway to draft a drip irrigation programme to save water. We hope it will be implemented by the next agricultural year he added. Restrictions on the supply of water to Crimea are an act of sabotage on the part of Ukraine Crimean Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov told the CrimeaInform news agency. Ukraines act of sabotage to limit the supply of water to the republic through the North Crimean Canal is nothing but a deliberate action against Crimeans he said. Aksyonov said negotiations are underway with Ukraine at the federal level to resolve the issue. There are backup plans. In any case Crimea will not be left without water. As for drinking water there are no problems with it he said. The prime minister said that the Crimean authorities were engaged in negotiations with all agricultural producers who have been cut off from water supply from the North Crimean Canal. The rice situation is the worst. Crimea is redrawing the map of crop areas in regions where irrigation may not be available he said adding that alternative areas were being offered to agricultural producers. The federal budget is ready to compensate agricultural producers for possible losses Aksyonov said. He recalled that this issue had been discussed with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak. Special conditions have been created for Crimea. No one will be left without help the prime minister said. We are also considering an alternative plan for drilling wells and we are working on this day and night he added. Aksyonov stressed that the persons who have seized power in Ukraine including former residents of Crimea Senchenko and Kunitsyn are acting like enemies trying to cause their former fellow citizens harm. But they will get a proper assessment from the people of Crimea and will always be persona non-grata in the republic. Usually those who mischief hatch mischief catch he said. According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85% of fresh water from this canal which was built in 1961-1971.

In Ukrainian crisis conditions Switzerland gives constructive dialogue example - official BELLINZONA (Switzerland) April 27 /ITAR-TASS/. Switzerland has shown an example of constructive dialogue and co-operation demonstrating in the difficult political situation the right approach to the solution of the acute problem that has been caused by the Ukrainian crisis deputy speaker of the Federation Council upper house of Russias parliament Yuri Vorobyov told Itar-Tass. He paid a working visit to Switzerland as a co-chair of the Switzerland-Russia inter-parliamentary friendship group. The position of Switzerland is very cautious and is based on an attempt to preserve its neutrality and simultaneously not to break relations with the European Union Vorobyov said. But nevertheless Switzerland is showing an example of constructive dialogue and co-operation. Switzerland today is a country in the European Union that demonstrates in the difficult political situation the right approach to the solution of the acute problem the FC member added. The co-chair of the friendship group from the Swiss side President of the Council of States (upper house) of the parliament of Switzerland Filippo Lombardi for his part expressed the hope for mediator efforts of the confederation especially in view of the fact that it chairs this year the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Switzerland currently presides in the OSCE and we hope that it will play its decisive role in the current difficult situation Lombardi said. Bern had previously refused to automatically repeat the EU and U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its position on Ukraine. At the same time the Federal Council (government) of Switzerland has taken measures not allowing the blacklisted by the EU persons to bypass the sanctions using Swiss banks. Thus they are prohibited to transfer money to Swiss banks however their existing accounts there will not be frozen. Vrorobyov also criticised the conduct of the majority of European parliamentarians in light of the Ukrainian crisis. In May we wanted to hold a meeting of the Association of European Senates but many countries have still not answered to this invitation or have refused he said. How can we settle complex political issues without meeting at the parliamentary level without discussing the hot issues and without hearing both sides the FC deputy speaker said calling such an approach an obvious demonstration of a counterproductive wrong conduct of politicians.

Neo-Nazis holding action in Lvov to commemorate Ukrainian SS division KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. An action of pro-Nazi Ukrainian nationalists dedicated to a yet another anniversary since the setting up of the Halichina Ukrainian division of the SS was held in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov Sunday local news media said. Several hundred radicals gathered near the monument to the most odious figure in the history of Ukrainian nationalism Stepan Bandera. The organizers said about 3000 people might take part all in all. Earlier on the same day former deputies of the Lvov town hall who had seats there in the first democratically elected convocation in the early 1990s issued a highly untypical statement voicing protest against the street march of the neo-Nazis which they said might inflict damage on the countrys national unity. The Lvov town hall of the first democratic convocation consisted for the most part of the deputies representing the Rukh (Pathway) party and other nationalistic organizations. It is noteworthy that the municipal authorities in Lvov and numerous public associations have espoused a radically opposite point of view as regards the marches of the embroidered blouses throughout all the years of Ukraines independence. Nazi ideology was implanted both at general schools (a special textbook on history was written for the Lvov school system) and at all levels of public life. A testimony to this can found in a downtown restaurant styled to a dugout hut of paramilitaries of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army which is profiled there as a highlight of cultural life. Interior and law enforcement agencies in Lvov have traditionally turned a blind eye to the situations where the radicals beat up the veterans of World War II who had fought on the Soviet side of the frontline.

Ukraine should not be field of geopolitical stand-off Lavrov The US has tried to orchestrate a 'color revolution' in Ukraine the Russian Foreign Minister says MOSCOW April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. The West uses Ukraine as a pawn in its geopolitical game Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said speaking at a global university forum. "The US has tried to orchestrate a 'color revolution' in Ukraine. Few people have doubts that it is not only about the future of Ukraine. They try to use it (Ukraine) as a pawn in a geopolitical game" the foreign minister said. Ukraine should not be a field of geopolitical stand-off but a connecting link Lavrov added. Not everybody has drawn conclusions from the Cold War. Despite political declarations pronounced at the highest level there was no progress in creating a common space of security and stability in Europe the foreign minister said. Our Western partners the US in particular try to act as if they won the Cold War and do not need to take Russias interests into account in their European policy Lavrov added. Russia call for a collective decision on resolving the Ukrainian crisis. "We used this approach in negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program on the Syrian chemical weapons" Lavrov noted.

By making this decision the United States was guided by absolutely distorted and unfounded perceptions regarding the events in Ukraine and around it Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov says MOSCOW April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. The unilateral sanctions against Russia imposed by the United States are illegitimate and run counter to the rules of civilised communication Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. We strongly condemn the announced set of measures aimed at trying to put pressure on Russia by means of sanctions. Unilateral exterritorial sanctions are illegitimate in nature. Not only do they not conform to the norms of civilised interstate communication and the practice of international relations but they also run counter to international law the diplomat told ITAR-TASS on Monday April 28. By making this decision the United States was guided by absolutely distorted and unfounded perceptions regarding the events in Ukraine and around it. Washington is pouring oil on the flames but has done nothing has not taken even one step to bring its proteges in Kiev to their senses. The new attempt at diktat and ultimatum undertaken by America against us will add no chance for a constructive resolution of the problems. The demands the protesters are putting forth in the eastern regions of Ukraine are absolutely legitimate. Instead of exerting pressure and making attempts to impose certain solutions the United States should get preoccupied with more intensive and substantive work with its clients in Kiev in order to normalise the situation Ryabkov said. USA publishes sanctions list with several Russian and Ukrainian officials US State Department restricts sale of defense products to Russia EU has published a list of 21 sanctioned Russian and Crimean officials EU expands black list of Russians and cancels EU-Russia summit in June Unfortunately we have to talk not only about sanctions against certain Russian individuals and companies but also about the revival of the seemingly bygone practice of restrictions on normal high-tech cooperation. Washington is basically restoring COCOM the Cold War-era method of limiting normal cooperation thus driving itself into the darkest and dustiest corner of the past epoch. This is not a 21st century policy. This is a reflection of the fact that people remain trapped by their own phantoms and perceptions and probably nostalgia for the long-gone world the diplomat said. Once again we can see that these steps are being taken by those who determine the Russian policy in the United States out of their own helplessness. They will certainly not achieve the goals they are seeking. The situation will deteriorate. We will respond and this will not be our choice. But we cannot leave this without reaction practical reaction based on our own decisions. The US behavior is becoming challenging in this respect Ryabkov said.

Banks will so far refrain from working in Crimea because of subsidiaries in Ukraine MOSCOW April 23.(ITAR-TASS). Major Russian banks will so far refrain from working in Crimea because they have subsidiaries in Ukraine Mikhail Zadornov the president and board chairman of the VTB 24 bank said at a business breakfast at the Rossiyskaya Gazeta daily on Wednesday. I would like to say that major banks are not going to work in Crimea so far because they all have subsidiaries in Ukraine Zadornov said adding the list of those banks included VTB the Bank of Moscow Sberbank and Alpha Bank. Zadornov explained that it was impossible to combine an active business in Crimea with active operations in Ukraine. That is why Russias major credit organizations are de facto transferring their operations in Crimea to banks that are going to work exclusively on the peninsula Zadornov stressed.

New sanctions against Russia can upset crisis resolution in Ukraine -official LUGANO April 26/ITAR-TASS/. New sanctions the United States and the European Union are threatening to impose on Russia on April 28 is the way in the opposite direction which will only upset the crisis resolution in Ukraine Yuri Vorobyov Deputy Chair of the Federation Council (upper house of parliament) said on Saturday April 26. New sanctions by the EU and the US are the way leading in the opposite direction. We have seen this before. On February 21 the decision was adopted with Poland Germany and France acting as guarantors and a protocol was signed. But it was never implemented. Then Russia the U.S. the EU and Ukraine met in Geneva and made decisions but no one is going to implement them he said. Vorobyov who is in Switzerland on a visit as co-chair of the Switzerland-Russia inter-parliamentary friendship group believes that Kiev bears prime responsibility for this. The agreement must be implemented by Ukraine a country where all these events are taking place. But all sanctions are directed against Russia which is not clear at all he added. Any sanctions will only complicate the settlement process and can do no good. Its a road to nowhere Vorobyov said. I dont think this is a logical way and I see no logic in such decisions they are counterproductive. At their meeting in Brussels on April 28 the ambassadors of the 28 European Union countries are planning to enlarge the black list for Russia. Earlier a U.S. administration official said that Washington might impose additional sanctions on Russia on the same day and that they would be coordinated with Europe but not necessarily identical.

In 2013 at the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget the SSJ-100 maker Sukhoi Civil Aircraft and the Bahrain leasing company AeroLease signed a letter of intent to finance and/or lease current or future SSJ-100 acquisitions. AeroLease CEO Masood al-Bastaki told reporters back then that the company was planning to buy 4-5 planes at the initial stage to test the market. Sukhoi Civil Aircraft hoped to sign a firm contract before the end of 2013 however no further information on cooperation between the two companies followed. In January 2013 Bahrain Air showed interest in the Russian plane. Its executive director said back then that the company was considering buying 3-5 planes but was choosing between Sukhoi SuperJet-100 and Bombardier. He said the company would make up its mind by the end of the first quarter of 2012. However Bahrain Air was liquidated in February 2013. Bombardier has an impressive share of the Middle East market. Regional companies use more than 200 Bombardier planes and the company says it will supply up to 1000 aircraft in the next twenty years. Sukhoi SuperJet-100 is a regional 100-seat plane designed and made by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in cooperation with Alenia Aermacchi. Its basic version can fly for a distance of up to 3048 kilometres. An increased range is 4578 kilometres. The company plans to start making a long-range version of the plane from 2013 and to offer a business version of the plane in 2015. It may be of interest to Middle East countries. Sukhoi hopes to sell 800 aircraft until the year 2024 while the global demand for the aircraft of this class totals 5400. The SuperJet the first new Russian passenger plane over the past 20 years is being created through unprecedentedly broad international cooperation that involves more than 30 major international aerospace companies system and component suppliers. Sukhoi SuperJet-100 integrates the world's best industry practices and solutions. Sukhoi SuperJet-100 integrates the world's best industry practices and solutions. All aircraft will be certified in accordance with both Russian and international requirements. SSJ100's technical and operational performance make the product fully marketable and capable of taking a solid share in the highly competitive global market. Thus Sukhoi expects to sell 800 aircraft until the year 2024 while the global demand for the aircraft of this class totals 5400. So far the company had secured 73 solid orders for the aircraft. SuperJet-100 will in the future provide the basis for a whole family of planes including transport and special purpose planes. However now the main goal is the certification of the plane and serial production of 60-70 planes annually. The Sukhoi SuperJet-100 family consists of two types of aircraft of basic and increased flying ranges with the carrying capacity of 75 and 95 passengers respectively.

Presidential candidate: situation in Ukraine can be settled in 2 days MOSCOW April 26//ITAR-TASS/. The crisis in Ukraine can be settled in a matter of two days presidential candidate and MP Oleg Tsarev said on Saturday April 26. The country can be saved and a war avoided. Its easy to do. It can be done in two days. The government simply needs to begin negotiations with us Tsarev told the Russian TVC television channels Pravo Znat (The Right to Know) programme to be aired on Saturday evening. The main point is to stop the war that is advancing on Ukraine he said. At the same time he believes that the [incumbent] authorities are showing no willingness to implement the Geneva agreement. The authorities are continuing arrests and repressions. The troops are surrounding small towns in the east. And I am seriously concerned that a mop-up [operation] will begin and blood will be spilled. This will forever separate the Southeast from Ukraine Tsarev said. In this situation one can only pin hopes on people. Ukrainians do not want to kill each other. All hopes are pinned on the people. They are sabotaging the war he said. Tsarev said assertions alleging that Russia is playing a role in the situation in the southeast of Ukraine were wrong. I personally know the people who are participating in the protest movement. I can see neither Russian money nor Russian aid nor Russian security services involved there he said. Early presidential elections in Ukraine are slated for May 25. Twenty-three candidates have qualified to compete for the presidency. Nine of them were nominated by political parties. Tsarev is an independent candidate a former member of the Party of Regions who offered on April 19 to mediate in the resolution of the crisis in the Southeast of Ukraine. He advocates cooperation with Russia official status for the Russian language and common history of the two countries.

KIEV April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine's radical nationalist group Right Sector has begun to form special battalion 'Donbass' in the Donetsk region Right Sector leader Dmitry Yarosh said on Wednesday. "We're coordinating all our actions with the leadership of Ukraine's Council of National Security and Defence the Interior Ministry and the Security Service" said Yarosh. The special unit will include activists and trained fighters of Right Sector to assist secret services. He underlined that Right Sector activists and fighters were ready to help secret services. According to Yarosh he has no fears that Right Sector's participation in the special operation in the east of the country might provoke clashes with Donbass population. Earlier on Wednesday Yarosh said Sector had moved its headquarters from Kiev to Dnepropetrovsk. "It's easier to monitor the situation in Donbass from Dnepropetrovsk" he said. Local media reported a meeting in camera between Yarosh and head of the Dnepropetrovsk regional administration Igor Kolomoisky. The Right Sector leader denied receiving funding from oligarchs. "We're not using oligarchs' money in politics but when a war is on we do not object to their funding the army" he said. On Wednesday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Right Sector despite the Geneva accords remained quite active. "We agreed in Geneva that any violence should be stopped" the diplomat said. "But the next day  acting President/ Turchinov ordered the army to shoot at unarmed people participating in peaceful protests. In Geneva we also agreed that extremists should be disarmed but Right Sector is still active." In Russia the Investigative Committee opened a criminal case against Yarosh on charges of public calls for terrorist and extremist activities which he had made through mass media. Yarosh was put on the international wanted list. Moscow's Basmanny court sanctioned his arrest in absentia.

China not ready to buy more Russian gas above 38 bcm being discussed MOSCOW April 23./ITAR-TASS/. Russias Gazprom is ready to supply more gas to China than the two sides are discussing but the buyer is not prepared to purchase extra volumes Viktor Timoshilov who is in charge of the companys eastern projects said on Wednesday April 23. We are negotiating with China for the supply of 38 billion cubic metres of gas eastward even though we could supply more but the buyer is not prepared to confirm the purchase of larger volumes he said. The sides are negotiating supplies in the amount of 38 billion cubic metres even though previously a figure of 60 billion cubic metres was discussed. Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said after a meeting with Zhou Jiping Chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) in early April that the next round of talks would be held at the end of the month. At the meeting the parties addressed the issues of arranging Russian pipeline gas supply to China. Miller and Zhou achieved considerable progress on a contract being hammered out to supply gas via the eastern route in accordance with the previously agreed Major Terms. At this round of talks we approved all the project-related technical matters. We advanced in our talks on the gas price. The parties agreed that the contract would come into force before the end of 2014 and that the next round of talks would take place in Moscow in late April Miller said summarising the meeting results. Gazprom may sign a contract for the supply of natural gas to China during President Vladimir Putins visit to Beijing in May of this year the company said in January after a meeting between Miller and Zhou. Both sides are interested in the successful completion of the talks and are determined to sign the contract as soon as possible it was proposed at the meeting that the contract should be ready for signing during the Russian presidents visit to China scheduled for May of this year the statement said. The parties noted that the negotiations were progressing as per schedule and the contract would enter into force in accordance with the previously agreed Major Terms until late 2014. In March 2013 the two companies signed a memorandum on pipeline gas supplies from Russia to China using the eastern route. Miller said back then that gas supplies to China could be prepaid. Given the cost of the gas transportation system to the Chinese border preliminarily appraised at 770 billion roubles an advance payment could be as big as 25 billion U.S. dollars. In June 2013 CNPC came up with new pricing proposals suggesting that the price of gas be pegged to the value of Henry Hub liquefied natural gas. But Gazprom said it was not ready to do that. The eastern route is an extension from the Sila Sibiri (The Force of Siberia) gas pipeline. The main parameters of supplies are: crossing point in Blagoveshchensk; volume of supply 38 billion cubic metres with a possible increase to 60 billion cubic metres; start of supply 2018. Over the past 10 years natural gas consumption in China has increased from 24 billion to 100 billion cubic metres a year. There are several possible routes for bringing gas to China. Gazprom insisted that Russian gas be initially supplied to China via the western route. China insisted that gas be initially supplied by the eastern route which it believes will reduce the cost of Russian gas supplies. At this point the cost of Russian gas deliveries including transportation is close to Chinas offer of 250 U.S. dollars per 1000 cubic metres. The western route is the Altai gas transportation system that will supply gas from Gazproms gas fields. The eastern route can deliver gas from fields in Eastern Siberia and Sakhalin. The agreement on strategic cooperation between Gazprom and CNPC was signed on October 14 2004. In June 2009 the governments of Russia and China signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation in the field of natural gas. CNPC is China's largest petroleum company wholly-owned by the state and is one of the world's leading integrated oil and gas production companies. In 2009 Gazprom and CNPC inked the Framework Agreement on the major terms and conditions of natural gas supply from Russia to China.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also intends to hold another telephone conversation on Ukraine with the US state secretary John Kerry on Friday Seven wounded as gunmen hurl bomb at Ukraines Odessa checkpoint MOSCOW April 25. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia will insist on respect to the Geneva accord on Ukraine and will strongly denounce attempts to distort it Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a forum of young diplomats in the Russian capital on Friday. "We will insist on the fulfillment of the Geneva agreements and prevent attempts to distort them" Lavrov noted adding that there "should not be any unilateral demands but attempts were made to present them to us." To make claims to us that we have allegedly signed in Geneva something that delegitimises actions of current authorities is a lie the minister noted. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov plans to speak by telephone with US Secretary of State John Kerry later this Friday to discuss the situation in Ukraine. Addressing a forum of young diplomats on Friday the minister said he also planned to discuss with his US counterpart the fate of Pavel Guberev elected in Donetsk as "people's governor" and currently held in custody. The Foreign Ministry said earlier that telephone contacts between Lavrov and Kerry planned for April 23 and 24 did not take place for reasons beyond Moscow's control. Earlier US Secretary of State John Kerrys statement that Ukrainian law enforcers had allegedly seized several Russian security agents was "not serious talk" Sergei Lavrov said. Kerry has said many times that Ukrainian security services had captured several Russian security agents. So show them to people show them on television Lavrov added. What current Kiev authorities are doing today is a punitive action and a crime against their own people Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. The so-called Easter ceasefire was disrupted the foreign minister said noting that What Kiev authorities are doing today is just a punitive operation which already resulted in many victims. These are bloody crimes for which they will be held responsible". The West wants to take control of Ukraine being guided only by their geo-political ambitions he added. It is high time for Western partners to admit the truth that they do not have a monopoly for truth the minister noted adding that And this is unacceptable to make a certain picture of current events as the West want it to be. The West wants to take control of Ukraine guided only by their geo-political ambitions. Today it is impossible to conceal the truth. And attempts to do so lead to nothing good Lavrov said. If current Kiev authorities really begin to fulfil the Geneva accord take away Maidan protesters and disarm Ukrainian ultranationalists from Right Sector their opponents in south-eastern Ukraine will take reciprocal steps Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov believes Stop to violence should be a first step the minister noted. He noted that this meant an immediate stop to armys actions against their own people. East Ukraine tension mirrors lack of comfort OSCE head says Russia will do everything to defuse the tense situation in Ukraine Sergei Lavrov said. Those who are currently in power in Kiev are to blame for the escalation he noted. "Maidan" remains in Kiev and nobody intends to leave it he said. "Instead of car tyres concrete blocks are placed there now and nobody intends to disperse" the minister said. "Instead of disarming the Right Sector and other radicals Americans rebuke us. "If we want to talk about actions it should be remembered who started the escalation" Lavrov added. "Escalation was started by the current authorities in Kiev who carried out the coup dtat. Russia will not use ultimatums in seeking to achieve goals from events in Ukraine Lavrov said. Certainly we do not have such a heavy-handed discipline which exists in NATO and the European Union though there are some opinions there that are different from the common position the minister said adding that We prefer not to act through ultimatums within the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)...We are decent people after all. When a resolution on Ukraine was moved in the UN General Assembly Americans and Western Europeans primarily Americans sent their emissaries throughout the world. There was not a single country where they had not knocked at with a demand to support compulsorily this Ukrainian resolution. In fact this is not a resolution on Ukraine but an anti-Russian one Lavrov said. Kiev awaiting Moscows explanations for war games in area adjoining border Kremlin verifies information on scale of clashes in Ukraine Putin's spokesman Right Sector radicals seize local administration building in Ivano-Frankovsk region Abkhazia and South Ossetia were not planning to follow Crimea's example Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a forum of young CIS diplomats on Friday. When asked about it the minister said he had not heard there was such intention. "Abkhazia and South Ossetia are our partners and we will respect the way they have chosen" he said. Lavrov added he would meet with the Abkhazian and South Ossetian foreign ministers later on Friday.

NEW YORK April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. Former Prime Minister and Batkivshchina (Fatherland) party leader Yulia Timoshenko said Ukraine must be a member of NATO even though a large part of people has many times spoken against this. In an interview with The Associated Press excerpts from which were published on Saturday April 26 Timoshenko who is running for presidency in Ukraine spoke of a fundamental change in public thinking following the latest events in the east of the country and Russias actions. She believes that the mentality of Ukrainians has changed as has the strategic course of the country. NATO is the best choice for Ukraine she said. The Associated Press said Timoshenko had previously not supported the idea of Ukraines membership in NATO. Timoshenko is confident that no Third World War will start over the events in Ukraine and believes that the world will not allow World War III. She also welcomed a new round of sanctions on Russia. Also Timoshenkohas urged her competitor Pyotr Poroshenko to revoke his proposal for talks with Russia. I want to stress once again that Pyotr Poroshenkos proposal to the Russian Federation that Russia should determine the place and time of the talks is unacceptable. The negotiation process being conducted in the EU-US-Ukraine-Russia format may not be broken Timoshenko said in a statement published on her partys official website on Saturday April 26. If any of the politicians breaks the negotiation process now and breaks the tough sanctions imposed upon Russia this will practically legalise the occupation of Crimea and acceptance of Russias ultimatums she said adding This will basically mean capitulation. Timoshenko urged Poroshenko not to break the negotiation process and to withdraw the proposal for a transition to such unclear bilateral negotiations. On Friday April 25 Poroshenko speaking at the Ukraine-Russia: Dialogue congress asked Moscow to name the place and time for talks while accusing Russia of being unwilling to implement the Geneva accord of April 17 which calls for de-escalation of tensions in Ukraine. Tycoon Pyotr Poroshenko is enjoying the biggest support among the constituencies according to public opinion polls published this week. They indicate that 32.9% of respondents are ready to vote for him in the upcoming presidential elections slated for May 25. Timoshenko is second and trailing far behind with 9.5% followed by MP Sergei Tigipko. In early April Poroshenko replying to a question whether Kiev wanted to join NATO urgently said No this does not depend on us; this depends on the organisation itself. We can feel that there is no consensus among its member countries on this issue. As president I would like to conduct negotiations with our neighbours about new alliances or additional security possibilities he said.

Sanctions against Russia to affect French companies French commerce chief warns French business community finds it extremely important to maintain talks between the two countries in different formats amid particularly sharp deterioration of relations between Russia and the West PARIS April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. French business circles consider Russia as a priority partner and if France imposes economic sanctions against Moscow this will affect French companies in the same painful way President of the French-Russian Commerce and Industry Chamber Emmanuel Quidet said on Thursday. We are passing through quite hard times anxiety reigns in French business circles over current situation he said opening the annual Paris conference on French-Russian co-operation and world visions of the countries. French business community finds it extremely important to maintain talks between the two countries in different formats amid particularly sharp deterioration of relations between Russia and the West Quidet said. It would be a worst scenario to interrupt these talks now he noted. EU US companies try to persuade governments not to impose sanctions on Russia FT Sanctions against Russia to speed up integration with Asia Pacific Region speaker As for Russias importance for French business Quidet recalled France was among the three largest foreign investors in Russian economy now. More than 1.2 thousand French companies operate in Russia around six thousand companies are related in some way with export on Russian market he noted adding that This is a total of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Russia is a key trend for us and sanctions would be a catastrophe for both countries. Russian economy remains attractive for foreign investors even despite temporary difficulties and growth of foreign political tension amid current Ukrainian crisis the head of the French-Russian Commerce and Industry Chamber added. In fact some slowdown is observed but it will be temporary Quidet said. In general Russia has several undisputable advantages including a low level of state debt massive gold and foreign currency reserves and an extremely strong middle class that had not been affected in the recent economic crisis he said. Russian market is one of most attractive for France and the country cannot be absent there the French commerce chief executive said.

Duma to consider in autumn amendments to law on retailers cost saving MOSCOW April 27 /ITAR-TASS/. The State Duma lower house of Russias parliament in autumn will return to the consideration of amendments to legislation that are aimed at cost saving for retailers RF First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview to the Rossiya 24 news television channel. We promised to the retail store networks that we will help them for example to write off the networks costs related to theft. Representatives of retail store networks say that the meagre percentage to which they are entitled under Russian legislation (retailers are allowed to include less than one percent from the proceeds in the sum related to products losses due to theft) is totally inadequate it is different from that of the EU countries and the United States Shuvalov said. In addition he noted retailers are dissatisfied with the requirement to maintain the trade outlets infrastructure and render an account of it in a manner that differs from the foreign practice. The request this kind of interaction from us and we are ready to provide it. But we say: please show us your progress regarding how you interact with food producers how you eliminate these malpractices that are forced on you by the suppliers of products and how you use the dispute resolution mechanism. So as soon as we see this progress in reality we will certainly respond the first deputy prime minister said. We have arranged with the State Duma security committee and economy committee to suspend so far these bills that are in favour of the retail store networks and return to this issue in autumn and see the current practice of interaction with food producers. If anything has changed for the better or not and then we will introduce certain benefits for them which in essence will mean spending from the regional budgets. Because they ask for certain benefits and will pay less taxes Shuvalov said. He stressed that the RF government and State Duma were ready to meet the retail store networks halfway only if they start to develop competitive relations and that there will be no cartels no collusions that food producers will have the possibility to come to retail networks and without any exactions additional forced services to supply their products for sale.

No logic in Wests readiness to recognize elections in Ukraine but not in Syria Lavrov Moscow will recognize only those results in Ukraine that are based on a comprehensive process Russia's minister of foreign affairs said MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was no logic in the Wests readiness to recognize elections in Ukraine without constitutional reform while refusing to do the same in Syria. US not ready to admit it cant run the show around globe Sergei Lavrov They [the United States] said and unfortunately this was picked up by the UN spokesperson that the elections in Syria called by President Assad for June 3 will be illegitimate because a transitional governing body should be created first on the basis of a new constitution and so on Lavrov said in an interview with the Russia Today television channel on Wednesday April 23. The Geneva communiqu says that a transitional governing body should be created [in Syria] which will develop the constitutional reform as the basis for general elections. The same sequence of actions was stated in the agreement on Ukraine of February 21: at first a government of national unity then constitutional reform and only then after a new constitution elections he said. The people who have come to power [in Ukraine] and declared themselves a government did not speak about constitutional reform at all in the beginning and said that presidential elections would be held on May 25. When we reminded them that constitutional reform was their obligation as well and that until they carry it out the east and the south would not recognize the legitimacy of what they were doing they remembered their obligation but said they would do it later Lavrov said. The West believes that all this is absolutely legitimate. Those who said that the Syrian presidential elections would not be legitimate without constitutional reform have already practically recognized the legitimacy of the elections in Ukraine slated for May 25 without constitutional reform the minister said. OSCE says seeing no signs of de-escalation in eastern Ukrainian regions Lavrov: Russian troops stay on own territory take no steps against obligations Right Sector still active despite Geneva deals Sergei Lavrov However Moscow will recognize only those results in Ukraine that are based on a comprehensive process he said. Announcing elections before a consensus is reached with the east and south of Ukraine would be destructive for the country. They [the authorities] must prove with actions and do what they promised to do. They said constitutional reform would be carried out and the status of the Russian language would be discussed as the south-east is demanding and they must start the process that will guarantee that all Ukrainian regions feel comfortable and know that they are heard and engaged in this process as equal parties Lavrov said. Once this process is over when the reform is ready it must be submitted to a referendum he said. It makes no difference what it is called federalization or decentralization the minister said recalling US Secretary of State John Kerrys remarks at a press conference in Geneva that Ukrainian regions would get autonomy. We want to be confident that the interests of the regions are taken into account that they decide their own fate within the state that respects their interests regarding the language culture history traditions heroes and their right to interact with their foreign neighbors Lavrov said noting that there were very many inter-regional ties between Russia and Ukraine. They [regions] want to elect their own leaders they want to keep more taxes for the development of their regions rather than give them all to Kiev and then wait for its handouts he said.

There would be no shortage of food products in Russia Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov says KHABAROVSK April 25./ITAR-TASS/. Russian Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov said there were no politics behind possible decisions to ban some supplies to Russia from some or other countries. "It is usual. It is just presented as something extraordinary due to the politicization of the situation around Ukraine" he said commenting on the reports about a possible ban on supplies of fruit and vegetables from Poland. The minister noted that the federal service for veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance and the federal service for supervision of consumer rights protection and human welfare previously regularly imposed bans because of detection of some diseases or phytosanitary quarantine or other problems. Fyodorov also assured that there would be no shortage of food products in Russia. The Russian Agriculture Ministry rules out any possibility of shortages of some food products because of restrictions or sanctions he told reporters in reply to a question about consequences of possible restrictions on supplies to Russia from some countries. Practically always there are alternative countries and alternative regions that can promptly begin to supply needed products he said. Federal budget spending on Crime to stand at 130 billion rubles minister Rosneft investments in Far East to reach 79 billion rubles by 2015 Rosneft president Russia not to face shortage of any food products because of sanctions minister Ukraine Slovakia to sign deal on reverse gas supply April 28 In his words there are several countries that offer supplies. "They say we have heard about possible restrictions and we would like to be the first to supply products alternatively for example instead of Poland Lithuania or some other country" he noted. Besides a position of farmers in Western countries is far from always being the same as that of their governments. The United States is unwilling now to be a friend of Russia but US producers of poultry pork and beef ask for access to the Russian market the minister notes adding that the influence of farmers in the United States is rather strong. "There are more than six million voters only and with family members there are tens of millions of voters. It is a very influential force in Europe and the US. So we will work if not with the administrations (of the countries) then with farmers of France the Netherlands and Canada" he added. On the whole there can be some minor delays to substitute supplies but no noticeable shortages in stores because of political processes are expected for rather a long period the minister assures.

The Kiev authorities should make the first step toward national reconciliation Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. The authorities in Kiev should take into account the regions demands and establish a dialogue Lavrov added. The foreign minister noted that over the last months the illegal militant groups were not disarmed. On the contrary the Kiev authorities started to rely more upon them.This in turn triggered the aggravation of the situation in the south-east of the country Lavrov emphasized. The agreement of February 21 was broken next day in the state coup. After that it became obvious that those who came to power were not able to bring everything to order in Kiev and in the country to control extremists Lavrov said. Illegal militant groups were not disarmed as was stipulated in the February 21 agreement. On the contrary they (Kiev authorities) relied on these groups that controlled the situation in the country and indulged the Right Sector the foreign minister added. What is now happening in Sloviansk what happened overnight in Mariupol these are the results of the irresponsible policy that relies upon ultranationalist extremist Neo-Nazi groups which should have been disarmed in accordance with the February 21 agreements Lavrov said.

MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Russias Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin believes that a UNpeacekeeping operation will be unrealistic in Ukraine. A United Nations peacekeeping operation is absolutely unrealistic because Ukraine is a very big country and there is no frontline there the Russian diplomat told the Russia 24 TV news channel on April 22. Churkin believes that the OSCE presence in Ukraine will be sufficient and that the most important thing is that the authorities in Kiev realize that the Geneva document should be implemented the right-wing forces should be disarmed and a constitutional reform should be carried out. Then the situation will defuse in its due course and no peacekeeping operation will be necessary Churkin stressed.

US planning new sanctions against Russia says White House aide WASHINGTON April 27./ITAR-TASS/. U.S. is about to introduce new sanctions to punish Russia and in particular to target a range of individuals and corporations as well as the Russian defense industry U.S. deputy national security advisor Tony Blinken said Sunday on a CBS program. Russias punishment is pursuant to its alleged failure to de-escalate the situation in Ukraines breadwinning eastern regions where the protesters from among the mostly Russian-speaking population whom Washington invariably labels as pro-Russian separatists are demanding a referendum on the future status of the area and the transformation of the country into a federation. "We're going to save a little news for Monday but what I can tell you is this" Blinken said. "We will be looking to designate people who are in his (Russian President Vladimir Putins - Itar-Tass) inner circle who have a significant impact on the Russian economy he said. We'll be looking to designate companies that they and other inner circle people control. We'll be looking at taking steps as well with regard to high-technology exports to their (Russian) defense industry Blinken indicated. All of this together is going to have an impact. Blinken claimed that the sanction introduced by Washington and Brussels after the mid-March referendum in Crimea on reunification with Russia had had a tarnishing effect on the Russian economy. "We've already seen a significant impact of the pressure we've exerted on Russia over the last several weeks he said adding specifically that the Russian financial markets were down 22% since the beginning of the year and the ruble is at the lowest level ever". Vladimir Putin said during a major annual question-time televised show April 17 that the West might be seeking to turn him into a major object of sanctions. Quite possibly theyre making an attempt of this kind. When he was asked about Western sanctions against businessmen Gennady Timchenko Arkady Rotenberg and Boris Rotenberg he said: They are good acquaintances of mine actually friends and they earned their capitals before we got to know each other. For instance Mr. Timchenko has been engaged in business since the beginning of the 1990s Putin said. Speaking seriously they just dont have anything to do with the events in Crimea. He said they had learned about the Crimean events from TV reports like most people in Russia. But they listened to the reports from there literally with tears welling in their eyes and if thats the reason for punishing them then they really have something to be punished for. Putin added in this connection that he had no shame for his friends conduct.

Russia's minister of foreign affairs urged the United States to use its influence to make the Kiev authorities assume responsibility for the current developments in Ukraine Putin: If Kiev starts to use army against people inside country this is serious crime MOSCOW April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. Stopping the unlawful actions of the Kiev authorities is the main condition for resolving the current crisis in Ukraine Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. We believe that the main condition for resolving the crisis in Ukraine is to stop the unlawful actions of the Kiev authorities who must realize their responsibility for everything that was written down [in Kiev] on February 21 and in Geneva on April 17. It says clearly that there must be no violence. The use of the army with the support of radical nationalists against the people is an absolutely unacceptable form of violence. Moreover I think this is a criminal decision he said. It [the agreement] also speaks of the need to disarm these national radicals after all and calls for fighting terrorism religious intolerance and anti-Semitism the minister said. It also says that a truly comprehensive and inclusive national dialogue must be started. We see none of this happening. Kiev authorities should make first step toward national reconciliation Lavrov Lavrov urged the United States to use its influence to make the Kiev authorities assume responsibility for the current developments in Ukraine. I have no doubt that our American partners can influence the people who have proclaimed themselves a government in Kiev. The anti-terror operation was announced immediately after the behind-the-scene visit to Kiev by the CIA director and the Easter break in this operation announced by Kiev was broken right after [US] Vice President Joe Bidens visit there. By the way Joe Biden met with the leadership of the country basically as a head of state holding an internal meeting. He sat at the head of the table with Ukrainian officials flanking him on both sides the minister said. I am convinced that our American colleagues can and should use their influence to make the present Kiev authorities not just realize but fulfill their responsibility for what is happening Lavov said.

German politician says dispatching of Germany military observers to Ukraine silly action BERLIN April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Germanys government did a silly and highly unprofessional thing as it sent a group of Bundeswehr experts to Ukraine upon an arrangement with the Kiev authorities Alexander Neu a deputy of Bundestag representing the Left Party said Sunday at a meeting of the parliamentary committee on defense. He believes an agreement on a verification operation or on the sending of military specialists to the east of Ukraine that was reached by Berlin and Kiev is doing an obvious disservice to the properly diplomatic observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that is currently doing its job in Ukraine. Charges of espionage that have been issued to the group by the pro-Russian activists in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk cannot be dismissed altogether as a minimum and in addition to it a question arises on why the detained officers are traveling the east of Ukraine precisely at this moment Neu said. The group that supposedly includes three German military experts a translator and observers from Denmark Poland the Czech Republic and Sweden one person from each country arrived in Ukraine under the cover of the OSCE at the invitation of Ukrainian government. It was arrested by peoples self-defense forces near the eastern town of Slavyansk Friday with the city officials saying the group had been engaging in espionage. On Sunday Bundeswehr Colonel Alex Schneider one of the groups members appeared at a news conference in Slavyansk to tell the reporters that he and other members of the group were getting fair and friendly treatment from their detainers in the rebellious East-Ukrainian city where the population is demanding a referendum on the future status of the Donbass Coalfields area and Ukraines changeover to a federated state structure. Col Schneider said the military experts making up the group were in good health and no one had done physical harm to them after their detention. He added he did not known when their release might take place. He said members of the group had spoken much to the people who had been guarding them since their arrival in Slavyansk and they had learned much about how the situation was affecting the locals families and how the current situation was exerting impact on peoples lives. Col Schneider also said the group members had been stunned upon seeing the level of impoverishment of the local people. In the meantime a spokesman for Bundeswehr said Sunday the dispatching of observers to Ukraine by a number of member-states of the OSCE had been coordinated with the security organizations steering bodies. He said the case in hand was not a bilateral measure of any kind but rather a coordinated mission at the invitation of the Kiev authorities adding that inspections of this kind began last month.

Western sanctions against Russia not to affect rouble economy - Kremlin aide The stronger the sanctions are the tighter the elite will become. This is the main effect from the sanctions presidential aide Andrei Belousov PETROZAVODSK April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. New Western sanctions against Russia will have no negative impact on the rouble or economic growth presidential aide Andrei Belousov said. They (sanctions) are insignificant. There may be some short-lived effects but they are unlikely to have any serious annual impact Belousov said on Monday April 28. He believes that the new sanctions announced by the European Union and the United States earlier in the day will only consolidate the Russian elite. The stronger the sanctions are the tighter the elite will become. This is the main effect from the sanctions he said. In his opinion the mentality of Russian people is such that the stronger the external factors the more likely internal consolidation in the country. I think the sanctions will produce an effect: they will mobilise us even more. What our colleagues do not understand is that these sanctions have led to the tightest consolidation of the elite over the past 10-15 years the aide said.

US not ready to admit it cant run the show around globe Sergei Lavrov "Ukraine is only one case that shows the United States unwillingness to make concessions in the geopolitical struggle" Russia's minister of foreign affairs said Russia surprised by distorted interpretation of Geneva statement by Kiev MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. The United States cant admit that it is unable to manage processes around the world from Washington single-handedly Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with RT television channel. As I said the point is not Ukraine. Ukraine is only one case that shows the United States unwillingness to make concessions in the geopolitical struggle Lavrov said. The Americans are not ready to admit that they cant single-handedly run the show in all corners of the planet from Washington that they cant impose their ready decisions on everyone he said. And they cant realize that is I think they are already beginning to realize but still keep instinctively adhering to the position that they dont need to take into account the opinions and interests of others the Russian foreign minister said. You know that in response to a demand to vacate the illegally occupied buildings in Kiev [US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs] Victoria Nuland said that everything that is still being held by protesters is being held with licenses and with the agreement of the government of Ukraine or with regular leases from the owners of the building he said. Its just incredible! Its hard to believe that they may use such arguments seriously Lavrov said. Sergei Lavrov called on the United States on Wednesday to stop thinking exclusively of geopolitical interests when dealing with the Ukraine crisis. In an interview with RTLavrov said Ukraine was only a manifestation of the USunwillingness to make concessions in its geopolitical struggle. As I said the point is not Ukraine. Ukraine is only a manifestation of USunwillingness to retreat in geopolitical struggle the Russian foreign minister went on to say. The situation in Ukraine is far from stable after a coup occurred in the country in February following months of anti-government protests often violent triggered by President Viktor Yanukovychs decision to suspend the signing of an association agreement with the European Union in November 2013 in order to study the deal more thoroughly. Amid riots during which radicals seized some government buildings in Kiev new people were brought to power whom Russia does not recognize as Ukraine's legitimate leaders. The self-proclaimed Ukrainian authorities appear unable to restrict radicals and ultranationalists. The crisis deepened when Crimea where most residents are Russians refused to recognize the legitimacy of the de facto Ukrainian leadership. Crimea reunified with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which it overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. After the reunification which Kiev and Western countries do not accept despite Russias repeated statements that the Crimean plebiscite was in line with the international law protests against the new Ukrainian authorities erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern territories with demonstrators taking control of some government buildings and demanding referendums on the countrys federalization. Ukrainian parliament-appointed interim president Oleksandr Turchynov on April 15 announced the start of an antiterrorism operation in the Donetsk Region apparently aimed to crack down on pro-federalization protesters.

BRATISLAVA April 28./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine is ready to pay its debt to Russias Gazprom for gas supplies at a price of 268.5 U.S. dollars per 1000 cubic metres acting Energy and Coal Industry Minister Yuri Prodan said. Ukraine is ready to pay the debt. But we cannot pay the price Gazprom set from April 1. It is unjustifiably high and is about 500 U.S. dollars. We are ready to pay under our obligations the minister said on Monday April 28. He said that the Ukrainian gas transit system would be incorporated into the European gas transportation system. We can also use the possibilities of our underground gas storage facilities and hope that European gas companies will build up their reserves in our storage facilities he said. Ukraine and Slovakia signed a memorandum of intent in Bratislava earlier in the day agreeing to organise reverse-flow gas supplies to Ukraine. A source familiar with the situation told ITAR-TASS that the amount of gas supplied in reverse mode might increase to 10 billion cubic metres. The two countries also agreed to explore the possibility of reverse-flow supplies by the transit pipeline used by Gazprom to deliver gas to Europe. According to Prodan reverse-flow supplies can reach 8 billion cubic metres by September 1 2014 not by 2015. Gas will be supplied by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline not the transit pipeline. EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said such supplies would not require the Russian companys agreement and would give Ukraine up to 10 billion cubic metres of a gas a year but stressed that reverse-flow gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine by the trunk pipeline would be impossible without Gazproms consent as it would run counter to the Slovak company Eustreams contractual obligations. Oettinger believes that diversification of supplies will help to solve Ukraines gas problem in part. However reverse-flow supplies from Poland and Hungary by the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline will not be enough for Ukraine get through the coming winter comfortably. He also said that the European Union was providing support to Kiev on the repayment of its gas debt to Russia. Meanwhile Naftogaz of Ukraine is planning to transport gas from Poland under a contract with Germanys RWE until the end of April and throughout May. According to the declared volumes Naftogaz of Ukraine is to get 4.022 million cubic metres of gas from Poland on April 15-22; 4.08 million cubic metres a day on April 23-30 and 4.022 million cubic metres on May 1-31. Up to date Ukraine was supposed to receive about 40 million cubic meters of gas from Poland. RWE AG resumed gas supplies to Ukraine through its division RWE Supply and Trading on April 15 under a five-year framework agreement with Naftogaz of Ukraine signed in May 2012. RWE supplies to Ukraine are based on the European pricing principles including transportation costs. The agreement provides for the delivery of up to 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year Naftogaz of Ukraine said. In 2013 RWE supplied about 1 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine. The maximum amount of gas Ukraine can get from Poland is 4 million cubic metres a day. However RWE has reiterated its readiness to increase gas supply to Ukraine as soon as transportation restrictions are lifted on the Slovak-Ukrainian border Naftogaz of Ukraine said. The European Union has promised assistance to Ukraine in diversifying natural gas supplies. Kiev is planning to buy about 290 million cubic metres of gas in Europe in reverse mode (about 140 million cubic metres will be delivered through Poland and the rest through Hungary). Ukraine has been receiving natural in reverse flows from Europe since November 1 2012. The gas is supplied across the Ukrainian border with Poland under a contract with from German RWE. The gas is supplied across the Ukrainian border with Poland. RWE planned to supply up to 5 billion cubic metres of gas to Ukraine until May 2013. Last year Naftogaz Ukrainy imported 55 million cubic metres of gas using the reverse flow scheme. The throughput capacity of the Ukrainian gas transportation is 288 billion cubic metres system at the entrance and 178.5 billion cubic meters at the exit including 142.5 billion cubic metres to European countries and 3.5 billion cubic metres to Moldova. Natural gas transit through Ukraine to Europe and CIS countries in 2011 increased by 5.7% from 2010 to 104197067000 cubic metres including to Western Europe by 5.9% to 101098013000 cubic metres but decreased by 2.4% to 3099054000 cubic metres to CIS countries. Ukraines gas transportation system consists of 72 compressor stations 110 production shops and 1451 gas distribution stations. The overall length of gas pipelines operated by the company is 38600 kilometres including 22200 kilometres of trunk pipelines and 16400 kilometres of extensions.

The former deputy prime minister responsible for the fuel and energy sector said this had to be done to switch relations to a normal track to avoid a halt in production notably in eastern Ukraine. We have a large number of enterprises oriented at the Russian Federation he added saying that about 300000 Ukrainians work at plants directly connected with Russian enterprises in a production chain." If Ukraine loses these ties people will be left without jobs which will further worsen the economic situation in the east of the country. We must stop clinching with Russia and abandon military rhetoric leaving the Russian factor to international organizations and our Western partners - guarantors of our territorial integrity he said.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Kiev have agreed on a visit to Donetsk peoples governor Pavel Gubarev who has been under arrest since March 6 on trumped-up charges. The visit will be paid at 18:00 Kiev time on Saturday April 26 by OSCE officials currently in Ukraine ICRC spokesperson for Europe and Central Asia David-Peirre Marquet told ITAR-TASS. He said the choice in favour of the OSCE had been made in keeping with the Geneva accord reached on April 17 by top diplomats from Russia the United States the European Union and Ukraine. On Thursday April 24 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had sent letters to the OSCE and the ICRC requesting immediate access to Gubarev. We will push for immediate access to Gubarev to make sure that he has no problems with health Lavrov said. We will of course continue efforts aimed at ensuring his immediate release as a political prisoner. Lavrov said in an interview with the RT television channel on April 23 that despite an agreement on amnesty for political prisoners Donetsk Region peoples governor Pavel Gubarev is in prison. Gubarev never seized buildings he was arrested only for calls for a referendum on federalisation. Gubarev is a political prisoner. A crowd of demonstrators in a square in the centre of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on March 1 proclaimed Pavel Gubarev peoples governor. The Ukrainian Security Service SBU promptly opened a criminal case against him on the suspicion of calls for changing Ukraines borders.

Russian FM: OSCE media freedom representatives remarks on Ukraine distort reality MOSCOW April 23./ITAR-TASS/. OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatovics remarks on the situation in Ukraine distort reality and undermines the authority of this international organisation the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. Moscow has noted the surprisingly biased analysis of the situation regarding the freedom of the media in Ukraine which was made by Dunja Mijatovic in an interview to CNN after a visit to that country the ministry said. The impression is that while announcing her assessments the OSCE representative does not understand or does not want to understand the real causes of the extraordinary danger hanging over the freedom of expression in Ukraine. She mentioned only cursorily more than 200 attacks on journalists on the territory controlled by the Kiev authorities. This is probably the first time after the end of World War Two that representatives of ultra-radical neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic movements have come to power in Europe. It is not surprising that they have basically imposed political censorship in the country the ministry said. Mijatovics position requires her to conduct an objective review of facts and help solve problems pertaining to the violation of the freedom of the media it said. In accordance with her mandate the OSCE representative should have urged those who are holding power in Kiev to begin investigating offences committed against journalists by extremist groups and restrictions on the freedom of the media. Dunja Mijatovics mission is to make Kiev correct the situation. She could have publicly demanded during the interview that journalist Konstantin Dolgov who had been arrested in Kiev under far-fetched pretext be released the ministry said. Russia has repeatedly drawn the attention of the authoritative OSCE institution to the essence of the latest developments in Ukraines mass media. But why does Dunja Mijatovic see the problem elsewhere again namely in the legitimate wish of the Russian-speaking population in the South-East of Ukraine which has been cut off by Kiev from Russian television channels to know the truth? Once again the OSCE representative mixed up the cause and the effect. Instead of giving an honest assessment of the atmosphere of information intolerance created by Kiev the CNN viewers for some reason were told about Russian Crimea again the ministry said. And this was done in a distorted manner ignoring the fact that people had for the first time in history had their linguistic and cultural diversity legitimately recognised and could freely choose the Russian information space where many international channels including CNN are available the ministry said. We would not like to believe that such high-ranking OSCE official is intentionally manipulating facts it added. Nevertheless there is the stubborn reluctance to see reality. These actions are not only imposing a distorted perception of the events in Ukraine upon the rest of the world but also undermining the authority of the whole OSCE the ministry said.

Right Sector still active despite Geneva deals Sergei Lavrov The Geneva Statement in particular envisions that all illegal armed formations should be disarmed in Ukraine MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. The Right Sector far-right ultranationalist Ukrainian group is still active despite agreements reached in Geneva last week Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday. US not ready to admit it cant run the show around globe Sergei Lavrov In Geneva [we] agreed that any violence should be stopped Lavrov said in an interview with RT television channel. However on the next day [Ukrainian parliament-appointed acting president Alexander] Turchynov ordered the army to shoot at unarmed people taking part in peaceful protests. In Geneva [we] also agreed on disarmament of extremists but the Right Sector is still rather active he said. The Geneva Statement adopted after last Thursdays meeting on Ukraine that involved Russia the United States the European Union and Ukraine in particular envisions that all illegal armed formations should be disarmed in Ukraine all administrative buildings unblocked and all protesters except for those who committed serious crimes pardoned. The new regime should start releasing political prisoners and implementing the agreements reached on February 21 which require among other things the surrender of illegal held arms. The authorities must disarm the Right Sector and they must stop making empty promises that all regions will be engaged in the constitutional reform Lavrov said in an interview with the Russia Today television channel on Wednesday April 23. He noted that the purpose of the agreement signed by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the opposition on February 21 was to make Yanukovych assume an obligation not to use police and not to declare a state of emergency. We can say that it was a capitulation. Everything he promised was done. Some say that he did not sign a law restoring the previous constitution but this law entered into force anyway. Therefore all of the oppositions demands were met Lavrov said adding that the opposition failed to keep its word. The purpose of the Geneva agreement of April 17 was to try to put the process back on track including constitutional reform that will engage all regions on an equal basis. Unfortunately the agreement has not been implemented by those who must take the first step the minister said. People need real actions. They are fed up with empty promises and are waiting for the order allowing the use of army against civilians to be cancelled Lavrov said. Russia surprised by distorted interpretation of Geneva statement by Kiev Right Sector actions threaten Geneva deals implementation - Russian FM Ukraine saw a coup and new people were brought to power amid riots in February whom Moscow does not recognize as Ukraine's legitimate leaders. The crisis deteriorated when Crimea where most residents are Russians refused to recognize the legitimacy of the self-proclaimed Ukrainian leaders and reunified with Russia on March 18 after a referendum two days earlier in which it overwhelmingly voted to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. After Crimeas incorporation by Russia protests against the new Kiev authorities erupted in Ukraines Russian-speaking southeastern regions with demonstrators seizing some government buildings and demanding referendums on the countrys federalization.

Lavrov calls for end to army operation against protesters in Ukraine MOSCOW April 26./ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday April 26 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an end to the army operation against protesters in southeastern Ukraine and for stopping aggressive actions of ultranationalists from the Right Sector. Lavrov also urged Kerry to use his influence for getting arrested protest leaders released. He [Lavrov] once again highlighted the issue of political prisoners and urged the United States to use its influence in order to get detained protest leaders in the South-East of Ukraine released. The secretarys attention was drawn to the proposals put forth by the Party of Regions and public movements in the South-East regarding the start of a nationwide dialogue and constitutional reform the Foreign Ministry said. Kerry assured Lavrov that Washington would seek to use its possibilities to prod the Kiev authorities into taking concrete steps to ease tensions and expressed hope that south-eastern regions would reciprocate. Lavrov and Kerry also discussed the steps being taken to settle the incident with the detention of European military observers who have arrived in Ukraine at Kievs invitation under the Vienna Document of 2011 on confidence- and security-building measures. They travelled to the South-East without properly notifying the public bodies that are controlling the situation in the region. On Friday April 25 supporters of federalisation detained a bus with passengers with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities. The OSCE confirmed to ITAR-TASS that these were not members of the Special Monitoring Mission or the election observation mission but had been sent to Ukraine by individual OSCE member states in accordance with the Vienna Document on confidence- and security-building measures. Yevgeny Gorbik a spokesperson for the supporters of federalisation told reporters that the detained military observers had been engaged in intelligence activities. The humanitarian group of the [OSCE] mission has denied any relation to them They [observers] had intelligence agents cryptograms and notebooks with secret notes Gorbik said. A Bulgarian officer had a notebook with notes in Russian which confirm his intelligence activities and speak of a meeting with agents he added. No charges have been brought against them so far. But theyve ended up in a company that calls into question the legitimacy of their activities Gorbik said adding The investigation is underway to find out what they were doing and where.

Ukrainian FM invites Russia to hold talks in Vienna April 28 It said that in reply to Kievs inquiry Moscow had failed to provide exhaustive explanations regarding the purpose and place of military manoeuvres held in the Southern and Western Military Districts KIEV April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has invited Russia to hold talks in Vienna on April 28 under the Vienna Document of April 28 on confidenceand security-building measures. It said that in reply to Kievs inquiry Moscow had failed to provide exhaustive explanations regarding the purpose and place of military manoeuvres held in the Southern and Western Military Districts over the past several days near the Ukrainian border the date of their completion and the number and type of military units involved. ICRC OSCE Kiev agree on visit to jailed Donetsk peoples governor Given the insufficient information received Ukraine has suggested to the Russian Federation that consultations be held in Vienna on April 28 as provided for in the abovementioned document in order to discuss this issue. Other states that have voiced concern about Russias military activities near the Ukrainian border have also been invited to take part in the consultations the Foreign Ministry said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the Russia Today television channel this week that Russian troops were staying on their own territory and were not taking any steps that would go against their obligations. We have never denied the fact that we sent additional troops to the border [with Ukraine] just as the Ukrainian government redeployed its troops closer to our border. Our troops are conducting exercises on the territory of our own country. Such exercises are conducted regularly since Sergei Shoigu was appointed defence minister Lavrov said. Exercises are held in different parts of Russia. As far as I know the next exercises will be held in the north-west of the country. This is a continuous process. The army must be in good shape and ready to act while hoping that it will not have to interfere the minister said. However if we are attacked we will respond by all means. If our legitimate interests and the interests of Russian people are directly affected as was the case in South Ossetia I see no way to respond other than doping so in full compliance with international law. Those who threaten the security of Russian citizens jeopardise the security of the whole country Lavrov said. He stressed the fact that Russian troops were staying on the territory of Russia. Demands for inspections under the so-called Vienna Document of 2011 and the Treaty on Open Skies were satisfied. Inspectors from the United States the European Union and Ukraine visited Russian troops bases and could not cite even one fact that would signify dangerous military activities on the part of Russia the minister said. We are on our own territory and are not taking any actions that would go against our obligations he said. Ukrainian troops are also staying on their territory but the difference is that they have an order allowing them to use weapons against peaceful citizens. This is a criminal order.

Lavrov urges OSCE to press for speedy release of political prisoners in Ukraine MOSCOW April 26 /ITAR-TASS/. In a telephone conversation with Swiss Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairperson in Office Didier Burkhalter on Saturday April 26 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of  arrests of public activists in the South-East of Ukraine and urged him to press for their speediest release. Burkhalter told Lavrov that the OSCE had secured access to Donetsk Region peoples governor Pavel Gubarev and would publish a memo on his condition after the visit scheduled for April 26. On Thursday April 24 Lavrov said Moscow had sent official letters to the OSCE and the ICRC requesting immediate access to Gubarev. We will push for immediate access to Gubarev to make sure that he has no problems with health Lavrov said. We will of course continue efforts aimed at ensuring his immediate release as a political prisoner. Lavrov said in an interview with the RT television channel on April 23 that despite an agreement on amnesty for political prisoners Donetsk Region peoples governor Pavel Gubarev is in prison. Gubarev never seized buildings he was arrested only for calls for a referendum on federalisation. Gubarev is a political prisoner. A crowd of demonstrators in a square in the centre of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on March 1 proclaimed Pavel Gubarev peoples governor. The Ukrainian Security Service SBU promptly opened a criminal case against him on the suspicion of calls for changing Ukraines borders. Gubarev detained on March 6 is being held in Kievs pre-trial detention centre. Having thanked Burkhalter for these efforts Lavrov drew his attention to other arrests of public activists in the South-East for political reasons and called on him to press for getting access to them and ultimately for their speediest release the Foreign Ministry said. Burkhalter said he was hoping to get from protesters in the south-eastern regions a complete list of such persons so that he could take necessary measures. He thanked Lavrov for Russias efforts to free the European military observers who had arrived in Ukraine at Kievs invitation under the Vienna Document of 2011 on confidence- and security-building measures and headed to south-eastern regions without properly notifying the public bodies that are controlling the situation in the region. On Friday April 25 supporters of federalisation in Slavyansk a city in the south-East of Ukraine detained a bus with passengers with unarmed military observers from OSCE countries among them. The observers are staying in the east of Ukraine at the invitation of the Kiev authorities.

Vyacheslav Ponomarev the peoples mayor of Slavyansk said the detained persons were not members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission but were military observers. The military were on our territory without our permission and were detained of course he said. What we should do with them we will know after we have determined who they are and what brought them here Ponomarev said adding that the detainees were being held in normal conditions. One of the military officials has diabetes but we have necessary medications and food [for him]. Ponomarev said the supporters of federalisation were ready to exchange the detained military for their comrades being held by the Kiev authorities. The Kiev junta is holding our comrades. But we are ready for an exchange if there is such a chance he said.

Water supply problem in Crimea to cost $247- 417 million - Kremlin aide The Ukrainian authorities reduced water supplies to Crimea last week alleging the peninsula owned Kiev a large sum for water Russias Crimea to repay $10 million debt to Ukrainian companies PETROZAVODSK April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. It will take 10-15 billion roubles ($247-417 million) to solve the problem of water supply to Crimea presidential aide Andrei Belousov said. Crimea can be independent in terms of water supply but it will cost 10-15 billion roubles ($247-417 million) he said on Monday April 28. One of the solutions would be supplying water from Russias southern Kuban region by building a pipeline. However Belousov said this would be an exotic option. Another solution would be drilling wells and using the existing water reservoirs. The Ukrainian authorities reduced water supplies to Crimea last week alleging the peninsula owned Kiev a large sum for water. However Crimean Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov said restrictions on the supply of water to Crimea were an act of sabotage on the part of Ukraine. Ukraines act of sabotage to limit the supply of water to the republic through the North Crimean Canal is nothing but a deliberate action against Crimeans he said. Aksyonov said negotiations are underway with Ukraine at the federal level to resolve the issue. There are backup plans. In any case Crimea will not be left without water. As for drinking water there are no problems with it he said. Russian government to provide subsidies for organizing transportation to/from Crimea The prime minister said that the Crimean authorities were engaged in negotiations with all agricultural producers who have been cut off from water supply from the North Crimean Canal. The rice situation is the worst. Crimea is redrawing the map of crop areas in regions where irrigation may not be available he said adding that alternative areas were being offered to agricultural producers. The federal budget is ready to compensate agricultural producers for possible losses Aksyonov said. He recalled that this issue had been discussed with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak. Special conditions have been created for Crimea. No one will be left without help the prime minister said. We are also considering an alternative plan for drilling wells and we are working on this day and night he added. Aksyonov stressed that the persons who have seized power in Ukraine including former residents of Crimea Senchenko and Kunitsyn are acting like enemies trying to cause their former fellow citizens harm. But they will get a proper assessment from the people of Crimea and will always be persona non-grata in the republic. Usually those who mischief hatch mischief catch he said. According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85% of fresh water from this canal which was built in 1961-1971. Crieman First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev said Kiev had no legal grounds for halting water supply. The Kiev junta has once again shown its real face he said. There is no and will be no shortage of drinking water in Crimea. But there will certainly be losses in agriculture. We cant say that the agricultural season has been wrecked but there will certainly be losses Temirgaliyev said. He said work was underway to draft a drip irrigation programme to save water. We hope it will be implemented by the next agricultural year he added.

Party of Regions: Russian language must be recognized as second official The matter is in the fact that Russian-speaking citizens account for at least 40% of the population in Ukraine Ukraine to hold early elections despite developments in eastern regions KIEV April  on recognition of Russian as the second official language in Ukraine is the unchanged position of the Party of Regions a parliament member and the secretary of the party's political board Boris Kolesnikov said on Thursday. "The position of the Party of Regions with regard to the Russian language has not been changed since 2003 we insist on its official status" he said. The matter is in the fact that Russian-speaking citizens account for at least 40% of the population in Ukraine. Therefore their interests must be protected in three main spheres education media and business communication Kolesnikov notes. Ukrainian Party of Regions refuses to vote in parliament until demands met "For example universities are maintained by all Ukrainian taxpayers. Some universities have the status of national but teach only in Ukrainian. It is violation of Russian-speaking citizens' rights isn't? Thus our voters are absolutely right to demand the official status for the Russian language" he said. As was reported earlier the regionals' leader in the parliament Oleksandr Yefremov said on Thursday that deputies from the party would not participate in voting in the parliament until their demands and demands of protesters in the country's eastern regions were met.

Kiev afraid Ukraines center and west may arise along with southeast president nominee According to Tsariov the crisis in Ukraine could be resolved in just a few days if the Kiev authorities lend an ear to the demands of people living in southeastern regions of Ukraine DONETSK April 25. /ITAR-TASS/. Kievs authorities are afraid that Ukraines centre and west could arise along with its southeastern regions Oleh Tsariov who is running for Ukrainian president said on Friday. Kiev authorities committing crime against own people says presidential candidate People used to come to Maidan [Kievs central Independence Square] to speak up for democracy and a better life against corruption of oligarchs and the authorities he said. Now we do not have more democracy. Some of Russian channels are banned in Ukraine journalists are detained political repression is underway army is engaged in a punitive operation against the people. Living standards are degrading and there are no conditions for their improvement he stressed. All that is going on is not what they promised to the people. That is why in his words Kiev is afraid that Ukraines central and western regions might follow the lead of the countrys southeast and arise. According to Tsariov the crisis in Ukraine could be resolved in just a few days if the Kiev authorities lend an ear to the demands of people living in southeastern regions of Ukraine. He said he had offered his candidature as a mediator between the authorities and protesters. There is a very simple way out of the current situation. I can speak with any protesters I am welcome everywhere he said. The authorities he stressed must show readiness to stop the army to take the troops back to their permanent garrisons to disband illegal armed groups to conduct amnesty and close cases against protesting officers of the riot police [Berkut] and to lend an ear to the demands about the status of the Russian language and the federalization of the country. To deescalate the conflict in his words the government should sit down at a roundtable and take a decision on amnesty and troops pullout. After that it must adopt a roadmap on amendments to be made to the constitution. We have out edition of the constitution and we are ready to present it to the government Tsariov said. It is much easier to try to reach an agreement than to kill own citizens he stressed. Earlier on Friday Tsariov said that the Kiev authorities were subordinate to the US administration. When in a span of two weeks the CIA director the US vice president and the head of the US Senate armed service committee pay visits to Kiev one has an impression that Ukraine is subordinate to the American administration he said. International cooperation is a good thing. But I dont want Ukraine to lose its political and economic independence he stressed.

Candidate for Ukraines presidency urges Kiev to stop using army for suppressing protests Mykhailo Dobkin also called upon the opposition and the Kiev authorities to pass a memorandum on mutual understanding as soon as possible KHARKIV April 24. /ITAR-TASS/. Ukraines authorities must stop immediately the use of Army units for the suppression of protests in the east of the country Mykhailo Dobkin a candidate for the post of president in the May 25 election representing the Party of Regions said Thursday at a session of the Kharkiv Regional Council. Aggressive rhetoric is coming from the Kiev officials more and more often Dobkin said. They call some people patriots and dismiss others as a horde he said. Authorities claim that some Ukrainians have died for the countrys freedom while others have died for God only knows what. The most aggressive representatives of the Kiev government feel free to do whatever they wish to and thats why I believe weve been absolutely right to include an immediate renunciation of the use of Army units as an instrument to suppressing protests in the East into the list of our demands Dobkin said. Dobkin also called upon the opposition and the Kiev authorities to pass a memorandum on mutual understanding as soon as possible. Kiev authorities should make first step toward national reconciliation Lavrov Ukraine to hold early elections despite developments in eastern regions Ukrainian Party of Regions refuses to vote in parliament until demands met Speaking at a plenary session of the Kharkiv regional council Dobkin suggested putting the memorandum into parliamentarians appeal as to priority measures on decentralization a higher role of local governments a constitutional reform and stabilization of social and political situation in the country. We want that the authorities listen at last to the opposition and sign a memorandum on mutual understanding that will help de-escalate tension in the country the head of the Party of Regions faction in the Kharkov regional council said. Today this attempt failed once again. On technicalities what the government offers is a set of phrases and nothing concrete. What the opposition factions suggest has an absolutely clear message and proposals that can be put into practice he said. Compromises must be made. One can use force to drive people away from a seized city council but one cannot change peoples mind and make them like and respect the present authorities Dobkin said. The Kiev government launched an active phase of the punitive operation near the city of Slavyansk in the Donetsk region Thursday morning. Armored vehicles are being brought into the area and snipers are occupying combat positions. Officials at the Interior Ministry in Kiev claim in the meantime that five protesters have been killed in the course of the armed standoff.

MOSCOW April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Russia celebrates Day of Russian Parliamentarism on Sunday April 27 2014. The memorable date was instituted by the June 27 2012 federal law introducing amendments in Article 1.1 of the federal law on days of military glory and memorable dates in Russia. The first Russian State Duma started working on this day in 1906. Last Russian Emperor Nicholas II issued a manifesto on establishing the State Duma as a legislative and consultative body on August 6 1905. However on October 17 1905 the all-Russia political strike made the emperor sign a manifesto on improvement of the state order which vested the Duma with powers of a lawmaking body. A festive opening ceremony of the first Duma was held on April 27 1906. The total number of its members ranged between 480 and 524 in different years. The countrys parliament was empowered to endorse the laws submitted by the government and approve the state budget. In the parliament prior to the revolutionary years party factions were formed. The Duma has introduced the procedure for considering legislative initiatives openness of its meetings deputy requests and settlement of disagreements by conciliatory committees. The law granted the right for freedom of speech at the parliamentary rostrum to lawmakers that was particularly important in Russia in those years. Tsarist Russia has had the four Dumas until the overthrow of monarchy. From the very start of its activity the parliament engaged in confrontation with authorities. As a result from four convocations only the third Duma has worked for the whole legitimate five-year term. The first Duma has worked only for 72 days from April 27 to July 8 1906 being disbanded by Nicholas II. The same fate befell the second State Duma that has worked from February 20 to June 3 1907. This Duma was disbanded over the accusation against the Social Democratic faction of a military coup. The third Duma has worked from November 1 1907 to June 9 1912. The last Duma in the history of Imperial Russia has operated from November 15 1912 until October 6 (19) 1917. In 1917 the February Revolution occurred in the country that resulted in the toppling of the monarchy and a dual power in the country between the Provisional Government and the Council of Workmens and Soldiers Deputies. The Provisional Government attempted to form a new parliament and elections in the first all-Russia Constituent Assembly were held in November 1917. But the Bolsheviks have disbanded the All-Russia Constituent Assembly already on January 6 1918. After the October Revolution in 1917 the All-Russia Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) became the supreme legislative body of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). After establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922 the Central Executive Committee with one house was formed and a two-house supreme state body was founded in 1924 to work between the Congresses of Soviets of the Soviet Union. A two-house Supreme Council has replaced the All-Russia Central Executive Committee in 1936. In the early 90s after the Soviet Union breakup introduction of the post of RSFSR president and re-division of functions between different branches of power became an important change in the state system. The Federal Assembly became a representative and legislative body of Russia according to the Constitution enacted in 1993. The Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation consists of two houses - the Federation Council upper house and the State Duma lower house. The State Duma comprising 450 lawmakers is formed in national direct elections and represents the countrys population in general the Federation Council consisting of 170 members acts as a representative body of constituent entities of the federal state [by one representative from representative and executive authorities in each Russian federal constituent entity]. Lawmakers of the State Duma and the Federation Council work on a professional permanent basis. The State Duma is elected for a five-year term fixed in the countrys Constitution the Federation Council does not have a limited term of powers. Lawmaking is the main function of the State Duma particularly endorsement of federal and constitutional laws resolutions within its jurisdiction. The Federation Council has the main goal to perform legislative powers including consideration of laws approved by the State Duma ratification and denouncement of international treaties the issues of status and protection of the state border the matters of war and peace. The State Duma declares an amnesty empowers the president to appoint the prime minister settles the issue of trust to the government the issue of bringing accusations against the president for his impeachment and hears a governmental report. The Federation Council has the powers to announce presidential elections and to relieve the president from the post. The Federation Council appoints the judges of the Constitutional Court the Supreme Court and the general prosecutor. The State Duma appoints and relieves from the post the Central Bank chairman and the human rights commissioner. Parliamentary houses divide powers to appoint the leadership and auditors of the Chamber of Accounts and members of the Central Election Commission. Meetings of both parliamentary chambers are held separately. First elections in the State Duma in modern Russian history were held on December 12 1993. Lawmakers of the second State Duma were elected on December 17 1995 the third Duma - on December 19 1999 the fourth one - on December 7 2003 the fifth one - on December 2 2007 and the sixth State Duma - on December 4 2011. The first Duma was elected for two years the term of next four lower houses has made four years and current sixth State Duma was elected for five years. Elections in the lower house of parliament were held according to the mixed election system from single-seat constituencies and the federal district [federal lists of candidates] from 1993 to 2003. Fifth and sixth State Dumas were elected according to the proportional system on federal candidate lists nominated by political parties. In 2016 elections in a seventh State Duma will be held according to the mixed election system that envisages that half of deputies [225 lawmakers] will be elected in single-mandate constituencies and another half of lawmakers - in the federal electoral district. The law to this effect was enacted on February 24 2014. At elections in the incumbent sixth State Duma four parties from seven ones registered in the country at that moment were elected in the parliament and formed their factions in the lower house. United Russia Party has gained 238 mandates the Communist Party of Russia (CPRF) - 92 seats A Just Russia Party - 64 seats and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) - 56 mandates.

Lawmakers still unable to agree on memorandum on settlement in eastern Ukraine KIEV April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Ukraine's parliament will make a new attempt on Thursday to coordinate the memorandum on settling the situation in the east of the country along with the bill to amnesty participants in the protests that swept across the eastern regions. Though the documents are not formally on the Thursday agenda lawmakers said they would be added as soon as a consensus was reached between the opposition /the Party of Regions and the Communists/ and the coalition comprising the Batkivshchina UDAR and Svoboda factions and two groups of lawmakers. On Wednesday the heads of the factions failed to reach an accord on the bill on amnesty for protesters in the east of the country. At present six alternative documents are offered for review in parliament. The cabinet submitted its own bill on inadmissibility of prosecution for the events during mass actions of civil confrontation that began on February 22 2014. The Party of Regions in the bill of its own called for amnestying all those who had captured administrative buildings in eastern regions as the new authorities had amnestied the protesters on Kiev's Independence Square. However the coalition which called the Maidan supporters "patriots" denounced protesters in the east as "separatists." It said it would object to exempting from punishment all the participants in the protests in the Donetsk Lugansk and Kharkov regions. Nor can the parliamentary factions come to terms on the memorandum on settling the situation in the east. Acting head of Batkivshchina Sergei Sobolev said that the Party of Regions and the Communists had snubbed with the document drawn by the coalition. "At present there is actually no support from the Party of Regions or the Communists for the draft of the memorandum of mutual understanding brought forward by speaker of Verkhovnaya Rada /parliament/ and the heads of the factions of the parliamentary majority" Sobolev said. Speaker Alexander Turchinov's document contains several provisions which the opposition flatly rejects. The document does not envision federalization broader powers for regions official status for other languages in certain regions and amendments to the Constitution. Last week the coalition tried to put Turchinov's document on the agenda but it failed short of the required 226 votes. Lawmakers came close to "the format of passing the memorandum" but had not reached a consensus yet the speaker said in comments on the situation. The Party of Regions drew its own version of the memorandum. Together with the Communists it calls for "fixing in the Constitution the status of Russian as the second state language." They also offered to immediately adopt the laws on reform of local self rule and regional governance. Specifically the document proposes replacing regional and district state administrations with executive committees of regional and district councils and delegating executive powers to them. The Party of regions also insists on direct elections of chairpersons of regional councils by regional communities in an open vote by residents and on providing necessary funding to regions through the establishment of fair distribution of budget revenue. Local authorities in the east of the country support these demands. For example deputies of the Kharkov Town Council asked Ukrainian lawmakers to pass a law on local referenda to realize people's right to the expression of will. "We the legitimately elected representatives of Kharkov support Kharkov residents' rights to the expression of their views and peaceful actions" the deputies said in a statement. They also said they were at one with regional residents' position voiced during an opinion pool in Kharkov in 2002 on using Russian together with the state language in all spheres of public life. Kharkov Town Council also asked the parliament to "take measures aimed at restoring citizens' constitutional rights to information and ensure the resumption of broadcasting of Russian television channels." Kiev-appointed chairman of the Donetsk region state administration /OGA/ Sergei Taruta called for all-Ukrainian referendum on the status of the Russian language and decentralisation of Ukraine. "People want the referendum and should be given the opportunity to hold it. I suggest setting the date for May 25 the day of Ukrainian presidential election" Taruta said. He believes it is necessary to begin to formulate questions for the referendum as soon as possible in order to secure accord between all the interested parties. His initiative was supported by mayors district councils and state administrations of the Donetsk region.

Earlier local media reported a meeting in camera between Yarosh and head of the Dneptropetrovsk regional administration Igor Kolomoisky. The Right Sector leader denied receiving funding from oligarchs. "We're not using oligarchs' money in politics but when a war is on we do not object to their funding the army" he said. On Wednesday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Right Sector despite the Geneva accords remained quite active. "We agreed in Geneva that any violence should be stopped" the diplomat said. "But the next day  acting President/ Turchinov ordered the army to shoot at unarmed people participating in peaceful protests. In Geneva we also agreed that extremists should be disarmed but Right Sector is still active." In Russia the Investigative Committee opened a criminal case against Yarosh on charges of public calls for terrorist and extremist activities which he had made through mass media.

Russia the European Commission and Ukraine are set to hold talks on problems over gas supplies to Ukraine Russia's Ambassador to the EU Vladimir Chizhov told an international conference on EU energy policy. It would not be quite honest and wise to expect that problems Ukraine is facing could be settled through efforts of Russia or the Russian Gazprom company he said. Ukraines gas debt has already exceeded $2.2 billion. Russia has once again postponed switching to advance payments for gas which is envisaged in the contract between Gazprom and (Ukraines state energy company) Naftogaz Chizhov added. "We expect that consultations between Russia the European Commission and Ukraine will take place shortly to produce a solution to this complex and critical situation he said. Consultations were due on Thursday in Bratislava Slovakia where energy agency heads of the EU Ukraine and Slovakia were to meet on reverse gas supplies. Chizhov told ITAR-TASS however that the European Commission was not ready for consultations with Russia's participation. He said EU Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger had sent a letter to Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak signaling European Commission's intention to organize such a meeting but specifying neither the timeframe nor the venue.

USA to announce further sanctions vs. Russia later on Monday According to Barack Obama they would be a response to Russia's failure to uphold an international accord aimed at stemming the crisis in Ukraine TOKYO April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. The US will announce a new package of sanctions against Russian individuals and companies in the course of the day US President Barack Obama stated in Manila where he is currently on an official visit. He added that the new sanctions are in response to Russia's failure to uphold an international accord aimed at stemming the crisis in Ukraine. Obama noted that the sanctions would be aimed at Russian citizens and companies. The sanctions would also affect the export of hi-tech commodities to Russia the American leader said. USA publishes sanctions list with several Russian and Ukrainian officials US State Department restricts sale of defense products to Russia EU has published a list of 21 sanctioned Russian and Crimean officials EU expands black list of Russians and cancels EU-Russia summit in June The USA imposed sanctions against Russia in response to its stance over Crimeas status. March 17 the USA announced a black list including 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials. In March and April the list has been expanded several times. To date the list includes several dozens of people who as US authorities believe undermine Ukraines sovereignty and territorial integrity. In addition the USA has suspended cooperation with Russia in the field of combating drug trafficking and in the space industry (except for the International Space Station project) and introduced restrictions for supplying military and double-purpose products to Russia. They should not treat Russia as a naughty schoolgirl who is being poked with a piece of paper on which she must tick off a report on her homework. It is impossible Seven leading industrialized states threatened Russia with further sanctions with regard to the situation around Ukraine. This says a G7 statement issued by the White House April 25. Governments of Canada France Germany Italy Japan Great Britain and USA as well as the European Union and the European Commission warned that they would not hesitate to impose additional sanctions against Russia. The authors of the statement believe that Russia is not taking any concrete steps to support the Geneva agreement and does not condemn separatists seeking to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. Moscow is also accused of holding threatening military drills near the Ukrainian border. The EU Council plans to adopt a regulation on expanding the black list for Russia until Monday evening. The list which includes so far 33 names may be completed by another 10-15 names of Russian officials and defense agencies representatives. All of them are banned entry to EU countries and possible assets on EU territory are frozen. Ambassadors of 28 members states of the EU also plan to discuss trade and economic sanctions against Russia. However as a diplomatic source told ITAR-TASS earlier there is no unity among the EU states on the appropriate economic measures against Russia nor is there any consensus on the necessity to introduce them. Representatives of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) which is in the ruling coalition believe that the possible introduction of further sanctions against Russia would not be an effective instrument in settling the Ukrainian crisis. Thus Deputy Head of SPD faction in the Bundestag Axel Schfer stated in an interview for Reinische Post newspaper that sanctions would hardly have any significance other than symbolic. Instead of this we should make even more diplomatic efforts and use every opportunity for dialogue with Russia the politician believes. A similar point of view expressed the SPD factions representative for military issues Reiner Arnold. I dont think that sanctions against specific people in Russia would have a positive effect on the overall situation (in Ukraine) he pointed out. The politician says that neither the increased NATO activity on eastern borders would yield any result. Schfer specified that federalization supporters in Ukraine are by no means impressed by military exercises of 500 NATO servicemen in Poland. German Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier who also represents SPD has repeatedly pointed earlier to the necessity to seek for diplomatic ways of resolving the crisis in Ukraine. In particular he called for holding round tables with participation of Kiev authorities and federalization supporters. In addition the minister believes that representatives of Russia USA EU and Ukraine should in a four-party format make joint trips to the countrys west and east to hold a direct dialogue with the parties of the conflict. German experts share the view that possible economic sanctions would have a negative impact primarily on German economy itself. Trade volume between Germany and Russia in 2013 amounted to 76 billion about 6000 Germany-based enterprises are making business with Russian companies and the total volume of their investments makes 20 billion. About 3000 jobs in Germany depend on economic relations with Russia.

Demonstrators who are demanding referendums on the countrys federalization took control of some government buildings. Ushakov also said that during the meeting the presidents will particularly focus on important issues concerning the bilateral trade and economic cooperation. Belarus is in the fifth place of Russias world trade partners and is in the first place among the CIS member states. Last year bilateral trade reached $39.7 billion while this figure stood at $43.8 billion and $38.6 in 2012 and 2011 respectively. Both countries are also actively cooperating with the frames of the Customs Union which besides Russia and Belarus also enlists Kazakhstan as a member state in this organization as well as within the frames of the Common Economic Space. This will be Putins fourth meeting with Lukashenko starting this year. They twice met in Russias resort city of Sochi on January 4 and February 7 and also held a meeting in the Russian capital of Moscow on March 5.

Sanctions against Russia on the part of the Group of Seven will unlikely help resolve the Ukrainian problem and may whip up tensions instead Qin Gang an official spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministrytold ITAR-TASS. Since the outbreak of the crisis in Ukraine we are engaged in an active dialogue with the G7 countries and we have made our position on the issue clear-cut he said.

Leader of Bulgarian Socialist Party: there are no grounds for sanctions against Russia SOFIA April 27./ITAR-TASS/. There are no grounds to impose economic sanctions against Russia Sergei Stanishev the leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party said on Sunday adding that problems in relations between Russia and Ukraine could be resolved by political means. The crisis in relations between Russia and Ukraine can be settled only by political means he told journalists. In his words any other tools used to settle the crisis situation in Ukraine would only create a spiral of tension reviving the cold war rhetoric and prompting actions that only aggravated the conflict. I see no grounds to impose economic sanctions against Russia he stressed. Someone may find it easy to suggest such instruments [sanctions] but we think that this is a road to nowhere and for that reason we insist on a political dialogue.

Russian Defence Minister said the increase in the activity of the U.S. and NATO armed forces in Eastern Europe near the Russian border was unprecedented MOSCOW April  Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu flatly denied unfounded assertions about the presence of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in Ukraine where they are allegedly destabilising the situation in south-eastern regions of the country. In a telephone conversation on Monday April 28 Shoigu and his U.S. counterpart Chuck Hagel had a frank one-hour conversation and exchanged concerns about tensions in Ukraine the Defence Ministry press service said. At the same time Shoigu said that under the pretext of fighting terrorism the Kiev regime had amassed about 80 tanks over 130 armoured personnel carriers and fighting vehicles at least 60 artillery systems and mortars in the South-East of Ukraine. Combat aircraft and helicopters are engaged on a regular basis. The overall number of Ukrainian troops has reached 15000 personnel and all this against the peaceful population of their own country the minister said. The possibility of forceful actions against peaceful people caused Russia to start large-scale manoeuvres on the national territory in regions bordering on Ukraine. This decision was made public he said. However as soon as the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had no intention to use regular military units against unarmed people the Russian units were ordered back to their bases. Shoigu said the increase in the activity of the U.S. and NATO armed forces in Eastern Europe near the Russian border was unprecedented and stressed that these actions have been accompanied by provocative statements by the NATO Secretary-General on the need to deter Russia the ministry said. The Russian Defence Minister also drew the attention of his American colleague to the anti-Russian hysteria unleashed lately in the Western press which does not help to calm down passions the press centre said. Hagel said these steps had been undertaken by Washington and Brussels in response to the situation in Ukraine but they were not provocative or expansionist and aimed to demonstrate the bloc unity and increased defence capabilities of the allies. Shoigu reaffirmed his readiness to maintain contact with all sides concerned in order to de-escalate tensions in and around Ukraine. He also called for constructive dialogue and search for compromises on the basis of the Geneva accord of April 17. The minister also commented on the incidents in which two Russian Su-24 planes flew over the American destroyer Donald Cook in Black Sea on April 12 and a Russian Su-27 jet fighter escorted an American RC-135 plane over the Sea of Okhotsk on April 22. Shoigu suggested instructing the chiefs of the Russian and American General Staff to discuss possible additional measures to avoid misinterpretation of each others actions in the future. The minister and the secretary agreed to maintain close contact.

OSCE secretary general to arrive in Kiev late on Sunday KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Secretary General of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Lamberto Zannier will arrive in Kiev late on Sunday Ukraines parliament-appointed Foreign Minister Andrei Deshchitsa said on Sunday. The situation over the release of OSCE observers [in Slavyansk] remains difficult he said. I am returning to Kiev. OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier is coming to Kiev in the evening too.

Former deputies in western Ukraine speak out against march commemorating SS division KIEV April 27./ITAR-TASS/. Former deputies of the town hall in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov who held seats during the first democratic convocation of the legislature in the early 1990s have spoken out against the March of Magnificence of the Spirit (also known as the march of embroidered blouses) scheduled for Sunday to mark a yet another anniversary since the setting up of the Halichina division of the SS by Nazi forces during World War II. The former deputies who were elected to the town hall in 1990 and thus became the founding fathers of regional legislative nationalism issued a special statement in connection with the march. It is noteworthy that the municipal authorities in Lvov and numerous public associations have espoused a radically opposite point of view as regards the marches of the embroidered blouses throughout all the years of Ukraines independence. Nazi ideology was implanted both at general schools (a special textbook on history was written for the Lvov school system) and at all levels of public life. A testimony to this can found in a downtown restaurant styled to a dugout hut of paramilitaries of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army which is profiled there as a highlight of cultural life. Interior and law enforcement agencies in Lvov have traditionally turned a blind eye to the situations where the radicals beat up the veterans of World War II who had fought on the Soviet side of the frontline. The Lvov town hall of the first democratic convocation consisted for the most part of the deputies representing the Rukh (Pathway) party and other nationalistic organizations.
