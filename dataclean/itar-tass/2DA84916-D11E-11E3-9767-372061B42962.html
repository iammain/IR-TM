Demonstrators said that they plan to stage a multi-thousand protest action against current Kiev authorities on May 1. Meanwhile around three thousand people are participating in a rally on Lenin Square in the centre of another big eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk local media reported on Sunday. The action began with a minute of silence in commemoration of Berkut police commandoes who perished in the clashes between law enforcers and radicals on Independence Square in central Kiev and in memory of activists who were killed by Right Sector radical ultranationalists on the Easter night at a checkpoint near another eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk.
