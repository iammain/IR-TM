Russia had never said it had already refused to accept the poll results Russian lawmaker says Russian delegation not to participate in June PACE session - Russian lawmaker MOSCOW April 24./ITAR-TASS/. Kiev authorities' behaviour towards candidates they oppose reinforces doubt about the forthcoming presidential election head of the foreign affairs committee in Russias State Duma lower house of parliament Alexei Pushkov told a news briefing on Thursday. Russia had never said it had already refused to accept the poll results. But it had strong doubts about whether the election scheduled for May 25 could be considered open legitimate and democratic Pushkov said. The actions that Kiev radicals take regarding all the other undesired candidates strengthen these doubts he added. Key to events was the attitude of Ukrainians who were against the current government. If those who stand against Kiev's authorities ignore the forthcoming election it will be very difficult for Russia to accept the poll results as correct and democratic Pushkov said.
