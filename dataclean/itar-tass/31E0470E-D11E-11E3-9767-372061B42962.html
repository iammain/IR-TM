Kiev has no legal grounds for halting water supply to Crimea - deputy premier SIMFEROPOL April 26 22:19 /ITAR-TASS/. Kiev has no legal grounds for halting water supply to Crimea its First Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliyev told ITAR-TASS on Saturday April 26. The Kiev junta has once again shown its real face he said. There is no and will be no shortage of drinking water in Crimea. But there will certainly be losses in agriculture. We cant say that the agricultural season has been wrecked but there will certainly be losses Temirgaliyev said. He said work was underway to draft a drip irrigation programme to save water. We hope it will be implemented by the next agricultural year he added. Restrictions on the supply of water to Crimea are an act of sabotage on the part of Ukraine Crimean Prime Minister Sergei Aksyonov told the CrimeaInform news agency. Ukraines act of sabotage to limit the supply of water to the republic through the North Crimean Canal is nothing but a deliberate action against Crimeans he said. Aksyonov said negotiations are underway with Ukraine at the federal level to resolve the issue. There are backup plans. In any case Crimea will not be left without water. As for drinking water there are no problems with it he said. The prime minister said that the Crimean authorities were engaged in negotiations with all agricultural producers who have been cut off from water supply from the North Crimean Canal. The rice situation is the worst. Crimea is redrawing the map of crop areas in regions where irrigation may not be available he said adding that alternative areas were being offered to agricultural producers. The federal budget is ready to compensate agricultural producers for possible losses Aksyonov said. He recalled that this issue had been discussed with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak. Special conditions have been created for Crimea. No one will be left without help the prime minister said. We are also considering an alternative plan for drilling wells and we are working on this day and night he added. Aksyonov stressed that the persons who have seized power in Ukraine including former residents of Crimea Senchenko and Kunitsyn are acting like enemies trying to cause their former fellow citizens harm. But they will get a proper assessment from the people of Crimea and will always be persona non-grata in the republic. Usually those who mischief hatch mischief catch he said. According to Ukrainian news agencies Kiev has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85% of fresh water from this canal which was built in 1961-1971.
