Palestinians' legitimate aspirations cant be fulfilled without consolidation - FM MOSCOW April 23. /ITAR-TASS/. Moscow welcomes practical steps to reset the process of Palestinian reconciliation the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday April 23. It described as important the visit to Gaza by a Palestinian delegation from the West Bank that began on April 22. The delegation led by a Fatah Central Committee member Azzam al-Ahmad met with HAMAS leader in Gaza Ismail Haniyeh. The two sides agreed to form a Palestinian technocratic government and hold general elections in keeping with the understanding reached earlier the ministry said. We regard this as a step in the right direction. Moscow has always adhered to the opinion that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people cannot be fulfilled and a fair and lasting settlement between Israel and Palestine on the well-known international legal basis cannot be achieved without the consolidation of Palestinian ranks on the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] and the Arab Peace Initiative platform the ministry said. The ministry said it would continue to assist Palestinians in achieving genuine national unity.
