"We will insist on the fulfillment of the Geneva agreements and prevent attempts to distort them" Lavrov noted adding that there "should not be any unilateral demands but attempts were made to present them to us."

East Ukraine tension mirrors lack of comfort OSCE head says Russia will do everything to defuse the tense situation in Ukraine Sergei Lavrov said. Those who are currently in power in Kiev are to blame for the escalation he noted. "Maidan" remains in Kiev and nobody intends to leave it he said. "Instead of car tyres concrete blocks are placed there now and nobody intends to disperse" the minister said. "Instead of disarming the Right Sector and other radicals Americans rebuke us. "If we want to talk about actions it should be remembered who started the escalation" Lavrov added. "Escalation was started by the current authorities in Kiev who carried out the coup dtat. Russia will not use ultimatums in seeking to achieve goals from events in Ukraine Lavrov said. Certainly we do not have such a heavy-handed discipline which exists in NATO and the European Union though there are some opinions there that are different from the common position the minister said adding that We prefer not to act through ultimatums within the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)...We are decent people after all.
