Kiev afraid Ukraines center and west may arise along with southeast president nominee According to Tsariov the crisis in Ukraine could be resolved in just a few days if the Kiev authorities lend an ear to the demands of people living in southeastern regions of Ukraine DONETSK April 25. /ITAR-TASS/. Kievs authorities are afraid that Ukraines centre and west could arise along with its southeastern regions Oleh Tsariov who is running for Ukrainian president said on Friday. Kiev authorities committing crime against own people says presidential candidate People used to come to Maidan [Kievs central Independence Square] to speak up for democracy and a better life against corruption of oligarchs and the authorities he said. Now we do not have more democracy. Some of Russian channels are banned in Ukraine journalists are detained political repression is underway army is engaged in a punitive operation against the people. Living standards are degrading and there are no conditions for their improvement he stressed. All that is going on is not what they promised to the people. That is why in his words Kiev is afraid that Ukraines central and western regions might follow the lead of the countrys southeast and arise. According to Tsariov the crisis in Ukraine could be resolved in just a few days if the Kiev authorities lend an ear to the demands of people living in southeastern regions of Ukraine. He said he had offered his candidature as a mediator between the authorities and protesters. There is a very simple way out of the current situation. I can speak with any protesters I am welcome everywhere he said. The authorities he stressed must show readiness to stop the army to take the troops back to their permanent garrisons to disband illegal armed groups to conduct amnesty and close cases against protesting officers of the riot police [Berkut] and to lend an ear to the demands about the status of the Russian language and the federalization of the country. To deescalate the conflict in his words the government should sit down at a roundtable and take a decision on amnesty and troops pullout. After that it must adopt a roadmap on amendments to be made to the constitution. We have out edition of the constitution and we are ready to present it to the government Tsariov said. It is much easier to try to reach an agreement than to kill own citizens he stressed. Earlier on Friday Tsariov said that the Kiev authorities were subordinate to the US administration. When in a span of two weeks the CIA director the US vice president and the head of the US Senate armed service committee pay visits to Kiev one has an impression that Ukraine is subordinate to the American administration he said. International cooperation is a good thing. But I dont want Ukraine to lose its political and economic independence he stressed.
