Western sanctions against Russia not to affect rouble economy - Kremlin aide The stronger the sanctions are the tighter the elite will become. This is the main effect from the sanctions presidential aide Andrei Belousov PETROZAVODSK April 28. /ITAR-TASS/. New Western sanctions against Russia will have no negative impact on the rouble or economic growth presidential aide Andrei Belousov said. They (sanctions) are insignificant. There may be some short-lived effects but they are unlikely to have any serious annual impact Belousov said on Monday April 28. He believes that the new sanctions announced by the European Union and the United States earlier in the day will only consolidate the Russian elite. The stronger the sanctions are the tighter the elite will become. This is the main effect from the sanctions he said. In his opinion the mentality of Russian people is such that the stronger the external factors the more likely internal consolidation in the country. I think the sanctions will produce an effect: they will mobilise us even more.
