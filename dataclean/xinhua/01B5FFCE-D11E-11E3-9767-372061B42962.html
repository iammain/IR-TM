"We are stopping common efforts to jointly cooperate with NATO taking into account the position NATO has taken during Ukrainian crisis" Nikolai Bordyuzha told reporters. The official explained that the decision has been made as a result of NATO's "blackmailing" of Moscow and its allies. Russia currently chairs the CSTO which comprises Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. NATO has been blackmailing all CSTO member countries because the Western alliance is unhappy with Russian actions in recent months he said. On Wednesday during a meeting of CSTO officials in the Chechen capital of Grozny Bordyuzha said that Russia and NATO had arrived at the state of "direct confrontation." Among those actions the CSTO chief mentioned anti-Moscow sanctions presence of NATO warships in the Black Sea and attempts of Ukrainian ultra-nationalists to sneak into Russia for subversive activity. Bordyuzha called these actions a "psychological attack" which provokes further rise of tension. In March Bordyuzha also criticized NATO's "self-propaganda" through the Ukraine crisis saying that NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen promoted himself through Ukraine's domestic political problems. Fresh unrest erupted in Ukraine's troubled east in early April when pro-Moscow activists seized government buildings in several cities demanding a referendum on autonomy and closer ties with Russia. Ukraine has accused Russia of supporting the unrest a move denied by Moscow.Home Page Photos Video Forum Most Popular Special Reports Biz China Weekly Follow Us On Xinhua Weibo Sina Weibo Facebook Twitter Make Us Your Home Page Services Database Markets Weather Site Index RSS Feedback Editions Global Edition China Edition Africa Edition Malaysian Edition Arabic Chinese(GB) Chinese(Big5) French Japanese Russian Spanish Global Edition China World Business Culture & Edu Sports Entertainment Science & Technology Health Travel Odd News In-Depth World Most Searched Prince George Mexico quake Malaysia Airlines Crimea MH370 Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo MOSCOW April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) has decided to suspend its contacts with NATO over the two blocs' confrontation around Ukraine the CSTO's Secretary General said Thursday.
