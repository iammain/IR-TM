Obama's trip originally scheduled for October last year will be the first by a sitting U.S. President since 1966. His earlier planned visit to Malaysia was put off due to the budget standoff which led to a partial U.S. government shutdown. He is expected to have official talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak on the current status of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA). According to officials Obama's visit will underlines the strong economic relations that form the bedrock of Malaysia-United States bilateral ties. Malaysia's Foreign Minister Anifah Aman said the United States remained one of Malaysia's biggest trading partner and a leading source of foreign direct investment in the country. "There is considerable potential to boost economic relations to increase linkages in new growth areas especially in emerging and high technology sectors" Anifah told a media briefing here ahead of Obama's three-day visit. On Monday morning Obama will witness the signing of several corporate agreements before leaving for Manila.
