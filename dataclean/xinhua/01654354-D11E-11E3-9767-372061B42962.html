(Xinhua) TOKYO April 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Barack Obama and Japan ese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday vowed to enhance bilateral ties and agree to continue their talks on the U. S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade talks. Obama saying in the summit with Abe commented the U.S.-Japan alliance as the "foundation" for not only the U.S. security in Asia-Pacific region but also "for the region as a whole." The president also welcomed Japan's efforts to lift its self- imposed ban on right of collective self-defense despite the move goes contrary against Japan's current war-renouncing constitution.

The president furthermore said that limited access to Japanese market must be addressed under TPP. For his part Abe said that the two sides have agreed to seek an early conclusion of the TPP free trade talks and they would release a statement after ministerial talks on TPP later the day.
