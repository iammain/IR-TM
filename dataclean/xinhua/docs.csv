"We are stopping common efforts to jointly cooperate with NATO taking into account the position NATO has taken during Ukrainian crisis" Nikolai Bordyuzha told reporters. The official explained that the decision has been made as a result of NATO's "blackmailing" of Moscow and its allies. Russia currently chairs the CSTO which comprises Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. NATO has been blackmailing all CSTO member countries because the Western alliance is unhappy with Russian actions in recent months he said. On Wednesday during a meeting of CSTO officials in the Chechen capital of Grozny Bordyuzha said that Russia and NATO had arrived at the state of "direct confrontation." Among those actions the CSTO chief mentioned anti-Moscow sanctions presence of NATO warships in the Black Sea and attempts of Ukrainian ultra-nationalists to sneak into Russia for subversive activity. Bordyuzha called these actions a "psychological attack" which provokes further rise of tension. In March Bordyuzha also criticized NATO's "self-propaganda" through the Ukraine crisis saying that NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen promoted himself through Ukraine's domestic political problems. Fresh unrest erupted in Ukraine's troubled east in early April when pro-Moscow activists seized government buildings in several cities demanding a referendum on autonomy and closer ties with Russia. Ukraine has accused Russia of supporting the unrest a move denied by Moscow."

(Xinhua/Niu Xiaolei) UNITED NATIONS April 25 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged on Friday all parties involved in the Ukraine crisis to honor their commitments under the Geneva Statement calling for an immediate halt of violence in Ukraine and practical steps to de- escalate the tension. At a daily news briefing here UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said: "The secretary-general is alarmed by the continued violence and loss of life in eastern Ukraine. The instability is contributing to a climate of fear and anxiety that can lead to a dangerous cycle of escalating tensions and serious miscalculations. " "The secretary-general is deeply troubled by the escalation in rhetoric and hardening of positions" Dujarric said. "The stakes are extremely high with potentially negative implications for international peace and security that extend far beyond eastern Ukrainian cities." Ban also cautioned all Ukrainians and their partners that the situation could spin out of control quickly with grave and unpredictable consequences urging all parties to honor their commitments under the Geneva Statement. The Geneva Statement was jointly issued earlier this month by top diplomats from Ukraine Russia the United States and the European Union on the crisis of Ukraine. Ban pressed all sides to cease any unhelpful actions and re- engage diplomatically to ensure full implementation believing that it would be a grave mistake for any party to turn to military means in an attempt to resolve political issues that can and must be addressed by peaceful means said the spokesman. Asked about a visit to the United Nations by the deputy foreign minister of Ukraine Dujarric said "he is not scheduled to meet with the secretary-general." Also on Friday Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Danylo Loubkiesky accused Russia of not implementing the Geneva Statement. "We demand and call upon the Russian authorities to withdraw troops from the Ukrainian boarder" said Loubkiesky at a press conference. "There is no any reason to keep troops near Ukraine" Loubkiesky said calling upon the Russian authorities to "exercise all necessary influence to that they have on the ground with Russian special agents working in our territory to release buildings to give away weapons." Ukraine said Friday that Russian troops conducting exercise close to the Ukrainian frontier this week came within one kilometer of the border but did not cross according to reports. Moscow does not recognize the interim Ukrainian government in Kiev and also accused Ukraine of doing nothing to carry out the Geneva Statement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of plotting to control Ukraine saying the pro-Russian insurgents will disarm and vacate buildings "only if Kiev authorities get down to implement the Geneva accords..." Pro-Russian militia have seized government buildings in more than 10 cities in eastern Ukraine. A new wave of unrest erupted in eastern Ukraine early in April when pro-Moscow activists occupied government buildings in the cities of Donetsk Lugansk and Kharkov. Kiev has repeatedly blamed Moscow for inciting the unrest and splitting Ukraine. Russia denies the charges."

WASHINGTON April 25 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations agreed Friday night to impose more sanctions on Russia over its "inaction" in easing the tension in eastern Ukraine. "We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia" said a joint statement issued by leaders of Britain Canada France Germany Italy Japan and the United States plus the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission. The announcement came as Moscow staged military drills on the joint border with Ukraine Thursday responding to Kiev's "anti-terror" operation that resulted in the deaths of five pro-Moscow protesters. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday it was Kiev not implementing the agreement and that Moscow had been eager to assist in the de-escalation of tension as agreed in last week's Geneva deal. The minister accused the West of attempting to "capture" Ukraine for geopolitical ambitions rather than the interests of the Ukrainian people. In Friday's announcement the G7 nations urged Russia to join efforts to seek a "diplomatic resolution" of the crisis threatening "broader coordinated sanctions" including sectoral measures in the event of further "destabilizing" moves from Russia. The United States and EU had hit dozens of Russians and pro-Russia Ukrainians including close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin with travel bans and asset freezes following Moscow's annexation of Crimea last month. However the 28-member bloc remains divided over full trade and economic sanctions against Russia considering the huge gas supplies from the country and their broad economic ties.

"Culture is the main essence uniting a nation. It doesn't much matter what is his formal ethnicity. What's important is how a person identifies himself" Putin told his cultural adviser Vladimir Tolstoy during a meeting. "In this sense it's very important for us to create a single cultural space" he said adding culture should play a historic role in the current complicated international environment. Tolstoy echoed Putin's opinion saying provocative appeals which could have led to isolation were very dangerous. "Talented people may have different points of view but it is important that the foundations of national cultural policy unite people" the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying. The advisor added that culture could become an instrument of soft power and proposed that the national cultural program must have in its core that "Russia is neither Europe nor Asia." Putin set up the Arts and Culture Council in 2004 to develop principles of state policy in the field of culture with Tolstoy serving the Council's secretary. The Russian government repeatedly underlined importance of " soft power" and of respect to national traditions in the modern world. In March Russian Foreign Ministry voiced concern over the UN Human Rights Council saying that "implementation of human rights must take into account traditions cultural and historical characteristics" of a country. Last July Putin said that Russia must be able to respond adequately on "soft power" use by other countries.

Obama's trip originally scheduled for October last year will be the first by a sitting U.S. President since 1966.

The inspectors were sent to Ukraine under an agreement reached in Vienna among the OSCE members. Some inspectors were detained on Friday by an anti-government group in the city of Slovyansk. WASHINGTON April 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday called for Russian help in securing the release of European monitors detained by pro-Russia militants in eastern Ukraine. In a telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov the third this week the top American envoy appealed for Moscow's support "without preconditions" for the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Ukrainian government to win the release of the OSCE military inspectors and their Ukrainian guides. The inspectors were sent to Ukraine under an agreement reached in Vienna on March 21 among the OSCE members with a view to easing tension and defusing a military standoff in the country. Some inspectors were detained on Friday by an anti-government group in the city of Slovyansk. Kerry spoke of Kiev's efforts to pass a bill granting amnesty to pro-Russia militants who were occupying government buildings and engaging in conflicts with the Ukrainian military in the country's east and efforts to promote "broad and deep" constitutional reform across the country. "He called on Russia to publicly support Ukraine's efforts rather than denigrate them" a senior State Department official said in a readout of the phone talks. "He also expressed continued concern that Russia's provocative troop movements on Ukraine's border its support for separatists and its inflammatory rhetoric are undermining stability security and unity in Ukraine" the official said. For his part Lavrov urged Washington to use its influence to help to secure the release of leaders of anti-government protests detained in southeastern Ukraine according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Washington and Moscow have been trading blame for the unrest in eastern Ukraine. Russian troops began military drills on the border on Thursday to respond to Kiev's "anti-terror" operation in the east to flush out pro-Russian militants occupying government buildings as well as to NATO's preparations for drills in Poland and the Baltic states. The leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations said on Friday that they had agreed to "move swiftly" to impose more sanctions on Russia in response to its inaction in helping to ease growing tension in eastern Ukraine. In their phone talks Kerry and Lavrov also discussed the ongoing efforts to remove chemical weapons from Syria as 92 percent have been removed out of the country mired in a three-year conflict. Kerry also expressed "strong concern" over reports of a recent attack using a toxic chemical likely chlorine the State Department official said.

The president furthermore said that limited access to Japanese market must be addressed under TPP. For his part Abe said that the two sides have agreed to seek an early conclusion of the TPP free trade talks and they would release a statement after ministerial talks on TPP later the day. Abe said that the two leaders' summit has vitalized the Japan- U.S. alliance and they will expand cooperation in the defense area. The two countries also agreed to work together with South Korea and China to deal with nuclear and missile issues of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) with Obama mentioning that the United States may put more pressure on the DPRK.

"We are stopping common efforts to jointly cooperate with NATO taking into account the position NATO has taken during Ukrainian crisis" Nikolai Bordyuzha told reporters. The official explained that the decision has been made as a result of NATO's "blackmailing" of Moscow and its allies. Russia currently chairs the CSTO which comprises Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. NATO has been blackmailing all CSTO member countries because the Western alliance is unhappy with Russian actions in recent months he said. On Wednesday during a meeting of CSTO officials in the Chechen capital of Grozny Bordyuzha said that Russia and NATO had arrived at the state of "direct confrontation." Among those actions the CSTO chief mentioned anti-Moscow sanctions presence of NATO warships in the Black Sea and attempts of Ukrainian ultra-nationalists to sneak into Russia for subversive activity. Bordyuzha called these actions a "psychological attack" which provokes further rise of tension. In March Bordyuzha also criticized NATO's "self-propaganda" through the Ukraine crisis saying that NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen promoted himself through Ukraine's domestic political problems. Fresh unrest erupted in Ukraine's troubled east in early April when pro-Moscow activists seized government buildings in several cities demanding a referendum on autonomy and closer ties with Russia. Ukraine has accused Russia of supporting the unrest a move denied by Moscow."

Danylo Loubkiesky accused Russia of not implementing the Geneva Statement. "We demand and call upon the Russian authorities to withdraw troops from the Ukrainian boarder" said Loubkiesky the press conference. (Xinhua/Niu Xiaolei) UNITED NATIONS April 25 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged on Friday all parties involved in the Ukraine crisis to honor their commitments under the Geneva Statement calling for an immediate halt of violence in Ukraine and practical steps to de- escalate the tension. At a daily news briefing here UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said: "The secretary-general is alarmed by the continued violence and loss of life in eastern Ukraine. The instability is contributing to a climate of fear and anxiety that can lead to a dangerous cycle of escalating tensions and serious miscalculations. " "The secretary-general is deeply troubled by the escalation in rhetoric and hardening of positions" Dujarric said. "The stakes are extremely high with potentially negative implications for international peace and security that extend far beyond eastern Ukrainian cities." Ban also cautioned all Ukrainians and their partners that the situation could spin out of control quickly with grave and unpredictable consequences urging all parties to honor their commitments under the Geneva Statement. The Geneva Statement was jointly issued earlier this month by top diplomats from Ukraine Russia the United States and the European Union on the crisis of Ukraine. Ban pressed all sides to cease any unhelpful actions and re- engage diplomatically to ensure full implementation believing that it would be a grave mistake for any party to turn to military means in an attempt to resolve political issues that can and must be addressed by peaceful means said the spokesman. Asked about a visit to the United Nations by the deputy foreign minister of Ukraine Dujarric said "he is not scheduled to meet with the secretary-general." Also on Friday Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Danylo Loubkiesky accused Russia of not implementing the Geneva Statement. "We demand and call upon the Russian authorities to withdraw troops from the Ukrainian boarder" said Loubkiesky at a press conference. "There is no any reason to keep troops near Ukraine" Loubkiesky said calling upon the Russian authorities to "exercise all necessary influence to that they have on the ground with Russian special agents working in our territory to release buildings to give away weapons." Ukraine said Friday that Russian troops conducting exercise close to the Ukrainian frontier this week came within one kilometer of the border but did not cross according to reports. Moscow does not recognize the interim Ukrainian government in Kiev and also accused Ukraine of doing nothing to carry out the Geneva Statement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of plotting to control Ukraine saying the pro-Russian insurgents will disarm and vacate buildings "only if Kiev authorities get down to implement the Geneva accords..." Pro-Russian militia have seized government buildings in more than 10 cities in eastern Ukraine. A new wave of unrest erupted in eastern Ukraine early in April when pro-Moscow activists occupied government buildings in the cities of Donetsk Lugansk and Kharkov. Kiev has repeatedly blamed Moscow for inciting the unrest and splitting Ukraine. Russia denies the charges."

The president also welcomed Japan's efforts to lift its self- imposed ban on right of collective self-defense despite the move goes contrary against Japan's current war-renouncing constitution.

The president furthermore said that limited access to Japanese market must be addressed under TPP. For his part Abe said that the two sides have agreed to seek an early conclusion of the TPP free trade talks and they would release a statement after ministerial talks on TPP later the day. Abe said that the two leaders' summit has vitalized the Japan- U.S. alliance and they will expand cooperation in the defense area. The two countries also agreed to work together with South Korea and China to deal with nuclear and missile issues of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) with Obama mentioning that the United States may put more pressure on the DPRK.

The announcement came as Moscow staged military drills on the joint border with Ukraine Thursday. In announcement the G7 nations urged Russia to join efforts to seek a "diplomatic resolution" of the crisis. WASHINGTON April 25 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations agreed Friday night to impose more sanctions on Russia over its "inaction" in easing the tension in eastern Ukraine. "We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia" said a joint statement issued by leaders of Britain Canada France Germany Italy Japan and the United States plus the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission. The announcement came as Moscow staged military drills on the joint border with Ukraine Thursday responding to Kiev's "anti-terror" operation that resulted in the deaths of five pro-Moscow protesters. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday it was Kiev not implementing the agreement and that Moscow had been eager to assist in the de-escalation of tension as agreed in last week's Geneva deal. The minister accused the West of attempting to "capture" Ukraine for geopolitical ambitions rather than the interests of the Ukrainian people. In Friday's announcement the G7 nations urged Russia to join efforts to seek a "diplomatic resolution" of the crisis threatening "broader coordinated sanctions" including sectoral measures in the event of further "destabilizing" moves from Russia. The United States and EU had hit dozens of Russians and pro-Russia Ukrainians including close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin with travel bans and asset freezes following Moscow's annexation of Crimea last month. However the 28-member bloc remains divided over full trade and economic sanctions against Russia considering the huge gas supplies from the country and their broad economic ties.

WASHINGTON April 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday called for Russian help in securing the release of European monitors detained by pro-Russia militants in eastern Ukraine. In a telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov the third this week the top American envoy appealed for Moscow's support "without preconditions" for the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Ukrainian government to win the release of the OSCE military inspectors and their Ukrainian guides. The inspectors were sent to Ukraine under an agreement reached in Vienna on March 21 among the OSCE members with a view to easing tension and defusing a military standoff in the country. Some inspectors were detained on Friday by an anti-government group in the city of Slovyansk. Kerry spoke of Kiev's efforts to pass a bill granting amnesty to pro-Russia militants who were occupying government buildings and engaging in conflicts with the Ukrainian military in the country's east and efforts to promote "broad and deep" constitutional reform across the country. "He called on Russia to publicly support Ukraine's efforts rather than denigrate them" a senior State Department official said in a readout of the phone talks. "He also expressed continued concern that Russia's provocative troop movements on Ukraine's border its support for separatists and its inflammatory rhetoric are undermining stability security and unity in Ukraine" the official said. For his part Lavrov urged Washington to use its influence to help to secure the release of leaders of anti-government protests detained in southeastern Ukraine according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Washington and Moscow have been trading blame for the unrest in eastern Ukraine. Russian troops began military drills on the border on Thursday to respond to Kiev's "anti-terror" operation in the east to flush out pro-Russian militants occupying government buildings as well as to NATO's preparations for drills in Poland and the Baltic states. The leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations said on Friday that they had agreed to "move swiftly" to impose more sanctions on Russia in response to its inaction in helping to ease growing tension in eastern Ukraine. In their phone talks Kerry and Lavrov also discussed the ongoing efforts to remove chemical weapons from Syria as 92 percent have been removed out of the country mired in a three-year conflict. Kerry also expressed "strong concern" over reports of a recent attack using a toxic chemical likely chlorine the State Department official said.
