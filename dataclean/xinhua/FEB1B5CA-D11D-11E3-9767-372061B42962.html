(Xinhua/Niu Xiaolei) UNITED NATIONS April 25 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged on Friday all parties involved in the Ukraine crisis to honor their commitments under the Geneva Statement calling for an immediate halt of violence in Ukraine and practical steps to de- escalate the tension. At a daily news briefing here UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said: "The secretary-general is alarmed by the continued violence and loss of life in eastern Ukraine. The instability is contributing to a climate of fear and anxiety that can lead to a dangerous cycle of escalating tensions and serious miscalculations. " "The secretary-general is deeply troubled by the escalation in rhetoric and hardening of positions" Dujarric said. "The stakes are extremely high with potentially negative implications for international peace and security that extend far beyond eastern Ukrainian cities." Ban also cautioned all Ukrainians and their partners that the situation could spin out of control quickly with grave and unpredictable consequences urging all parties to honor their commitments under the Geneva Statement. The Geneva Statement was jointly issued earlier this month by top diplomats from Ukraine Russia the United States and the European Union on the crisis of Ukraine. Ban pressed all sides to cease any unhelpful actions and re- engage diplomatically to ensure full implementation believing that it would be a grave mistake for any party to turn to military means in an attempt to resolve political issues that can and must be addressed by peaceful means said the spokesman. Asked about a visit to the United Nations by the deputy foreign minister of Ukraine Dujarric said "he is not scheduled to meet with the secretary-general." Also on Friday Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Danylo Loubkiesky accused Russia of not implementing the Geneva Statement. "We demand and call upon the Russian authorities to withdraw troops from the Ukrainian boarder" said Loubkiesky at a press conference. "There is no any reason to keep troops near Ukraine" Loubkiesky said calling upon the Russian authorities to "exercise all necessary influence to that they have on the ground with Russian special agents working in our territory to release buildings to give away weapons." Ukraine said Friday that Russian troops conducting exercise close to the Ukrainian frontier this week came within one kilometer of the border but did not cross according to reports. Moscow does not recognize the interim Ukrainian government in Kiev and also accused Ukraine of doing nothing to carry out the Geneva Statement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of plotting to control Ukraine saying the pro-Russian insurgents will disarm and vacate buildings "only if Kiev authorities get down to implement the Geneva accords..." Pro-Russian militia have seized government buildings in more than 10 cities in eastern Ukraine. A new wave of unrest erupted in eastern Ukraine early in April when pro-Moscow activists occupied government buildings in the cities of Donetsk Lugansk and Kharkov. Kiev has repeatedly blamed Moscow for inciting the unrest and splitting Ukraine. Russia denies the charges.Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Danylo Loubkiesky speaks during a press briefing at the United Nations headquarters in New York on April 25 2014.
