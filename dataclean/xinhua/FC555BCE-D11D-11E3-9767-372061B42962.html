"We're going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified and the United States and Europe is unified rather than this is just a U.S.-Russian conflict " Obama said at a joint press conference after meeting Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Obama said although an international agreement had been signed to de-escalate the crisis Russia had not lifted a finger to help. "In fact there is strong evidence that they (Russia) have been encouraging the kinds of activities that have taken place (in Ukraine)" he said. Obama is on a three-day official visit to Malaysia which began on Saturday.
