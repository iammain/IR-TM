Words of prais e Malaysia's government has been widely criticized over its handling of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and disclosures of its investigations. But on Sunday U.S. President Barack Obama had words of praise during a visit to the southeast Asian country. He said the Malaysian government has been "forthcoming" with the United States about the information it has. "The Malaysian government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and investigate exactly what happened" Obama told reporters. He reiterated that the United States would continue to aid in the search and offered condolences to loved ones of those lost. Narrowed search nears end Obama's visit came as the initial search by the Bluefin-21 neared its end. The submersible which is on contract to the U.S. Navy had been scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane. Previously another device a towed pinger locator detected signals that officials believed were from the jet's flight recorders which determined the current search area for the Bluefin. The plane disappeared on March 8 after leaving Kuala Lumpur Malaysia for Beijing. Preliminary report Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said a preliminary report on the plane's disappearance will be available to the public next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week his office said. The report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization the U.N. body for global aviation but not yet made available to the public. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. "Anytime there is a tragedy like this we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again" Obama said. "That discussion has begun in Malaysia and around the world and we'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security. One thing is already clear however is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations." Why didn't emergency beacon work?

Words of prais e Malaysia's government has been widely criticized over its handling of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and disclosures of its investigations.

He said the Malaysian government has been "forthcoming" with the United States about the information it has. "The Malaysian government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and investigate exactly what happened" Obama told reporters. He reiterated that the United States would continue to aid in the search and offered condolences to loved ones of those lost. Narrowed search nears end Obama's visit came as the initial search by the Bluefin-21 neared its end. The submersible which is on contract to the U.S. Navy had been scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane. Previously another device a towed pinger locator detected signals that officials believed were from the jet's flight recorders which determined the current search area for the Bluefin. The plane disappeared on March 8 after leaving Kuala Lumpur Malaysia for Beijing. Preliminary report Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said a preliminary report on the plane's disappearance will be available to the public next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week his office said. The report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization the U.N. body for global aviation but not yet made available to the public. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. "Anytime there is a tragedy like this we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again" Obama said. "That discussion has begun in Malaysia and around the world and we'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security. One thing is already clear however is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations." Why didn't emergency beacon work?

"Anytime there is a tragedy like this we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again" Obama said.

Words of prais e Malaysia's government has been widely criticized over its handling of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and disclosures of its investigations. But on Sunday U.S. President Barack Obama had words of praise during a visit to the southeast Asian country. He said the Malaysian government has been "forthcoming" with the United States about the information it has. "The Malaysian government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and investigate exactly what happened" Obama told reporters. He reiterated that the United States would continue to aid in the search and offered condolences to loved ones of those lost. Narrowed search nears end Obama's visit came as the initial search by the Bluefin-21 neared its end. The submersible which is on contract to the U.S. Navy had been scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane. Previously another device a towed pinger locator detected signals that officials believed were from the jet's flight recorders which determined the current search area for the Bluefin. The plane disappeared on March 8 after leaving Kuala Lumpur Malaysia for Beijing. Preliminary report Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said a preliminary report on the plane's disappearance will be available to the public next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week his office said. The report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization the U.N. body for global aviation but not yet made available to the public. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. "Anytime there is a tragedy like this we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again" Obama said. "That discussion has begun in Malaysia and around the world and we'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security. One thing is already clear however is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations." Why didn't emergency beacon work?

Words of prais e Malaysia's government has been widely criticized over its handling of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and disclosures of its investigations.

He said the Malaysian government has been "forthcoming" with the United States about the information it has. "The Malaysian government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and investigate exactly what happened" Obama told reporters. He reiterated that the United States would continue to aid in the search and offered condolences to loved ones of those lost. Narrowed search nears end Obama's visit came as the initial search by the Bluefin-21 neared its end. The submersible which is on contract to the U.S. Navy had been scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane. Previously another device a towed pinger locator detected signals that officials believed were from the jet's flight recorders which determined the current search area for the Bluefin. The plane disappeared on March 8 after leaving Kuala Lumpur Malaysia for Beijing. Preliminary report Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said a preliminary report on the plane's disappearance will be available to the public next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week his office said. The report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization the U.N. body for global aviation but not yet made available to the public. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. "Anytime there is a tragedy like this we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again" Obama said. "That discussion has begun in Malaysia and around the world and we'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security. One thing is already clear however is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations." Why didn't emergency beacon work?

"Anytime there is a tragedy like this we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again" Obama said.
