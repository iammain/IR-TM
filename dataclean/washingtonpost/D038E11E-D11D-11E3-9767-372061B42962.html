(William Booth/The Washington Post) Strange things have been happening in eastern Ukraine a place swirling with rumors of imminent invasion by the "Little Green Men" (what the suspected Russian troops without insignia are being called). A couple of British journalists and I were driving back to our hotel after a day of chasing news on the outskirts of Slovyansk when Boris our intrepid taxi driver pointed out the window and shouted Look at that! We or at least I ducked -- but then we looked. It was a large gray military-style helicopter. And something was falling out of the sky. It was dropping leaflets which fluttered toward the highway to Kramatorsk then drifted in the spring breeze into a cow field and apple orchard. Mission accomplished.

The instructions continue: They ask peace-loving citizens to inform law enforcement about suspicious people and groups of people carrying bags.They ask please don't join any self-defense groups: They're anti-Ukrainian. Also: Avoid participating in mass rallies. The leaflet warns that there are Russian GRU assets circulating in the crowds (GRU is Russia's military intelligence directorate) and that they might liquidate those who criticize Russian politics. On that note the instructions also warn the peaceful citizens to keep themselves and loved ones away from terrorists and anti-Ukrainian actions. Why? Because "all those who participate in anti-Ukrainian actions are potential victims.
