Heres Putler: The mash-up image of Putin and Hitler sweeping Ukraine This March photo shows activists in Berlin holding placards depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin as Adolf Hitler reading Putler and hands off Ukraine in front of the Ukrainian embassy. (AP Photo/Gero Breloer) Comparisons between Hitler and Putin are trending big time.Hillary Clinton first cooked it up in early March referencing Crimea. Now if this sounds familiar she said its what Hitler did back in the 30s.... Germans by ancestry were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places [and] Hitler kept saying theyre not being treated right. I must go and protect my people. Then the German finance minister said the Crimea absorption was analogous to Hitlers 1938 seizure ofSudetenland. Weve seen this before in  saidbefore quickly backing off the comment.Hitler took over the Sudetenland with these types of tactics. Afterward as reported by Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen a prominent Russian thinker mulled the same. One must distinguish between Hitler before 1939 and Hitler after 1939 Andranik Migranyan said. The thing is that Hitler collected [German] lands. If he had become famous only for uniting without a drop of blood Germany with Austria Sudetenland and Memel in fact completing what Bismarck failed to do and if he had stopped there then he would have remained a politician of the highest class. Since March those comparisons have been manifested visually and theyre sweeping not only Ukraine but social media as well. They call it Putler. And yes it looks a little creepy. We Call Him #PUTLER : For the #Ukraine the Enemy Is Obvious  @JohnKerry @NATO @statedept  LOrion (@LOrion) April 23 2014 In Kiev the capital of Ukraine where Putin isnt exactly Mr. Popular Putler has been slapped on signs thrown up on 40-foot towers and beamed onto Twitter where one Ukrainian has dispatched nearly 3000 tweets under the moniker PUTLER KAPUTT .

We call him Putler a Kiev local named Max told Mashable which first reported Putler. He is a total bd! Our heroes are fighting Hitler again one woman told Mashable. Perhaps symbolic of that notions traction in the public Putler has now climbed the 40-foot Maidanyolkatower into a place of prominence. Putin is Hitler on tower looking over #Maidan . #Ukraine  David Patrikarakos (@dpatrikarakos) April 19 2014 Lots of people are compared with Hitler which some say has made the reference meaningless. But the current comparisons between Putin and Hitler resonate more than some others particularly in Europe. Hitler framed his incursion into Czechoslovakia as protection for ethnic Germans not as an invasion. Now compare that to this weeks statements out of Moscow: There has been a surge in appeals to Russia to save themForeign Minister Sergei Lavrovsaid despite the fact that recent polls show 85 percent of ethnic Russians in Ukraine dont feel threatened. We are being put into an extremely complex position.
