Ukraine's government has said its troops have killed five "terrorists" in operations to take back the pro-Russian stronghold of Slovyansk an operation which has prompted Russia to order new military exercises on the Ukrainian border. The Ukrainian interior ministry said on Thursday that the pro-Russian rebelswere killed as paratroopers took over three "illegal checkpoints" around the town which has been in separatist control for almost two weeks. Videos posted online showed smoke rising from barricades around the town. Reports said that rebels had set fire to the barricades as they abandoned them and retreated from Ukranian forces. The Reuters news agency reported that Ukrainian troops had set up new positions around the town. The AFP agency said that Ukrainian forces had told pro-Russian rebels to leave government buildings they were occupying although this was not confirmed by any other source. The operation prompted Russia to order new military exercises in regions bordering Ukraine. NATO has estimated its deployment at 40000 troops. "We are compelled to react to such a situation" Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian news agencies. "From today military exercises have started in regions bordering Ukraine involving battalions of tactical forces of the southern and western military districts." President Vladimir Putin had warned earlier on Thursday that there would be consequences if the Ukraine army was used against pro-Russian activists. "If Kiev really began to use the army against the country's population... that is a very serious crime against its own people" he said. The operation came hours after the government reported that its forces had taken control of the town hall in the city of Mariupol and repelled an attack on an army base in the eastern town of Artemivsk the ministries said. Separatist sources also reported the loss of the town hall in Mariupol. The city was the scene of a rebel attack on troops last week that left three rebels dead. The separatists had held the town hall since April 13. "The town hall is liberated and can function normally" Arsen Avakov Ukraine's interior minister said on his Facebook page. The Defence Ministry said in a statementthat Ukranian forces repelled nearly 100 separatists in an attack on the military base in Artemivsk just north of rebel-held Donetsk. "The attackers were repelled and suffered significant losses" Oleksandr TurchynovUkraine's actingpresident said. US President Barack Obama said on Thursday that Russia had failed to abide by the spirit of a deal to ease tensions in Ukraine and that new sanctions against Russia were being "teed up". He said "malicious armed men" continued to occupy buildings in eastern Ukraine in contradiction to a deal agreed last week in Geneva by Ukraine Russia the EU and the US. Barnaby Phillips and Peter Sharp report "So far we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva" Obama said. If that continued he said "there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions". On Wednesday Sergey Lavrov the Russian foreign minister warned that Russia would respond if its interests were threatened and made reference to Russias invasion of Georgia in 2008 after Georgian forces attacked separatists in its pro-Moscow region of South Ossetia.

The United States has imposed sanctions on seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a fresh attempt to force Moscow to back down from its intervention in Ukraine. The White House on Monday said the third round of sanctions in response to the Ukraine crisis was prompted by Moscow's failure to adhere to an April 17 agreement in Geneva on ways to resolve the situation. Officials made clear that sanctions against key sections of Russia's economy will be imposed including the energy and defence sections should Russia send troops massed along the Ukraine border into eastern Ukraine. The seven Russians sanctioned include two Putin allies: Igor Sechin head of Russia's major oil company Rosneft and Sergei Chemezov head of Rostec a Russian state-owned high-tech products company. The 17 companies will be subject to an asset freeze. Russia's Volga Group one of the targeted companies said on Monday that Washington's measures were "politically motivated statements and decisions". The other people named on Monday were Oleg Belavencev who is Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea Dmitry Kozak deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation Evgeniy Murov director of Russia's federal protective service and an army general Aleksei Pushkov a state Duma deputy and Vyacheslav Volodin a Putin adviser. The White House said that Washington would also deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. EU action The US decision coincided with a preliminary agreement reached by European leaders to impose asset freezes and visa bans on 15 more people. The names of those to be added to the list will not be made public until they are published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday. The US has been much more aggressive in the penalties it has imposed on Russia than has the 28-nation European Union which depends heavily on Russia for energy. The EU has previously imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 33 Russians and Crimeans for their part in Russia's seizure of Crimea last month. Armed separatists loyal to Russia have been seeking more autonomy in eastern Ukraine where they haveseized government buildings set up roadblocks or staged protests. On Monday Hennady Kernes the mayor of Kharkiv the countrys second largest city was shot by gunmen and was said to be undergoing surgery according to his office. Kernes was a staunch opponent of the pro-West Maidan movement that toppled President Viktor Yanukovich in February and was widely viewed as the organiser of activists sent to Kiev from eastern Ukraine to harass those demonstrators. But he has since softened his stance towards the new Kiev government and insisted that he does not support the pro-Russia separatists or any annexation of Ukrainian territory.

Manila - US President Barack Obama hasarrived in the Philippines in a visit widely seen as a part of Washington's "pivot to Asia strategy." Obama landed justhours after Philippine Defence Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg signed a new military agreement allowing more troops in the country. The Philippine government said the pact was an affirmation "of the robust and enduring strategic partnership between" the two allies. Talking to reporters in Manila Goldberg said that the new agreement would not allow the reopening of US bases in the Philippines something that has been opposed by nationalist forces and is prohibited by the 1987 Constitution. In Depth: US and Philippines sign ten-year defence pact No way home for Filipino 'Amerasians' Toxic trail shadows US-Philippine bases deal But the agreement essentially allows US access to Philippine military bases across the country. Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago chairman of the PhilippinesSenate Committee on Foreign Affairs told Al Jazeera that the agreement has "marginal advantages" for the country and is more beneficial to the US. With the signing of the agreement Santiago said the US "could claim that it has 'contained' China because the Asian countries involved including the Philippines are now bound by their respective agreements with America". "It would make the Philippines sounds as if we are a satellite ally of America" she said. During a joint press conference with the Philippine president President Obama said he goal of the US was not to contain China. "We welcome China's peaceful rise. We have a constructive relationship with China" Obama said. "Our goal is not to counter China our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make international rules and norms are respected and that includes areas of maritime disputes. "Our primary interest is the peaceful resolution of conflict including navigation that allows for continued progress and prosperity. We continue to stand shoulder to shoulder to uphold peace and security in this region and around the world." Philippines president Benigno Aquino said the agreement "reaffirms our countries commitment to mutual defense and security and promotes regional peace and stability." "Both President Obama and I share the conviction that territorial and maritime disputes in the Asia-Pacific region should be settled peacefully based on international law. We affirm that arbitration is an open friendly and peaceful approach to seeking a just and durable solution" he said. Disputes with China Anti-China sentiments have been on the rise in the Philippines which is engaged with Beijing over disputed atolls in the potentially oil- and gas-rich South China Sea with both countries claiming Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal as their own. The Philippines has accusedBeijing of becoming increasingly aggressive in staking its claims to the sea and has called on the US for greater military as well as diplomatic support. China and the Philippines are stuck in territorial dispute While the treaty is seen to boost Manila's confidence in countering the Chinese power Santiago warned that the country must be careful in handling the agreement and avoid the violation of the Philippines constitution. "Filipinos should keep uppermost the supremacy of the Philippine Constitution" she said. "We should not accommodate any foreign power at the cost of the sovereignty of our Constitution even if the problem is presented as if it were a problem of national survival." Activists opposing what they call "US imperialism in Asia" raise the question of sovereignty. They cite a case in 2005 whenfive US soldiers were initially sentenced to life in prison for allegedly raping a Filipino woman before the ruling was overturned by another court and they were set free despite public anger. Another issue that has spiked contempt is the alleged dumping of toxic waste in the northern Philippines supposedly by US military ships which Washington denies. 'Exaggerated threat' Jose Maria Sison the exiled leader of the Communist Party of the Philippines and one of the top opponents of the deal told Al Jazeera that the agreement practically reopens the US bases in the country. "The US military bases shall be practically re-established under the guise of facilities built on Philippine military grounds with the Filipino military personnel practically serving as perimeter security guards and with the Philippine government sharing the costs" he said. Sisonalso said the US "is exaggerating the threat of Chinese aggression in order to justify its pivot to East Asia" while establishing bases in the Philippines and "at the same time claiming neutrality between The Philippines and China". Buthe also said that China "is not helping itself by outlandishly claiming about 90 per cent of the entire South China Sea including its high seas and threatening to grab 90 per cent of the exclusive economic zone and 100 per cent of the extended continental shelf of the Philippines". Speaking toAl Jazeera Dr Francisco Nemenzo a political scientist and former president of the University of the Philippines criticised the negotiators for concealing the details of the agreement. Nemenzo saidthe deal "just legitimises what they [the US] have been doing all these years: allowing the establishment of an American base within a Philippine base which a Filipino commander cannot even enter. "We want to know if the deal is a blanket agreement allowing the US to set up a military facility wherever they want to."

A group of eight European military observers being held prisoner by pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine have appeared in public for the first time since their capture and gave assurances that they were not being mistreated. Seven officers from the observer team and their translator were brought into a room of waiting journalists in the separatist-held administration building in the city of Slovyansk on Sunday. Guards in camouflage fatigues and balaclavas carrying Kalashnikov rifles were also in the room as journalists spoke to the observers. Colonel Axel Schneider from Germany who appeared nervous as he spoke for the group stressed they were on a diplomatic mission under the auspices of the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) when they were detained on Friday and were not spying for NATO as the separatists claim. Schneider said he understood that the self-proclaimed city mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov could use the observers as a bargaining chip. Later one of the men a Swedish national was released by the group on medical grounds. "He has a mild form of diabetes and so we decided to let him go"Stella Korosheva a spokeswoman for the separatist mayor told reporters. Ponomaryov said on Saturday that they could be released in exchange for jailed pro-Russia activists and told reporters that he was heading into talks with the mediators. "In our town where a war situation is going on any military personnel who don't have our permission are considered prisoners of war" he told reporters. Ponomaryov said he was preparing to meet OSCE mediators to negotiate the terms of the group's release. "The mayor of this city granted us his protection and he regarded us as his guests" Schneider told journalists in Slovyansk in eastern Ukraine. "We were accommodated in a cellar. We had to set up conditions for ourselves" said Schneider describing what happened after they were seized. "Since yesterday we've been in a more comfortable room with heating. We have daylight and an air conditioner." "I can tell you that the word of the mayor is a word of honour. We have not been touched." Schneider told reporters that none of the European delegation were sick. "We have no indication when we will be sent home to our countries" Schneider said. "We wish from the bottom of ourhearts to go back to our nations as soon and as quickly as possible." Ponomaryov who was wearing a pistol in a holster and was escorted by two armed bodyguards claimed in the interview that the OSCE observers "are not our hostages -- they are our guests". Asked about Russia's promise to do everything it could to convince the pro-Kremlin rebels in Slovyansk to release the OSCE military observers Ponomaryov said he had "no direct contact with Moscow." Three members of Ukraine's special forces bearing signs of torture have been paraded before the media [Al Jazeera] Captured officers Ponomaryov also said that pro-Russian separatists had separately "arrested" three Ukrainian officers a colonel a major and a captain he said had been sent towards Slovyansk on a spying mission. "There were a total of seven in their group and we arrested three of them. We will swiftly get the four others" he said. Footage has emerged showing the three captured officers bearing signs of torture being paraded before the media in Slovyansk. Ukraine's SBU security service confirmed the three officers had been seized. The rebel mayor said there would be no contact with Kiev over the imprisoned Ukrainians because the pro-Kremlin separatists see the capital's Western-backed government as illegitimate. "There will be no contact with Kiev only through the intermediary of the OSCE" he said. Ukraine's authorities he said "understand only the language of force."

Videos posted online showed smoke rising from barricades around the town. Reports said that rebels had set fire to the barricades as they abandoned them and retreated from Ukranian forces. The Reuters news agency reported that Ukrainian troops had set up new positions around the town. The AFP agency said that Ukrainian forces had told pro-Russian rebels to leave government buildings they were occupying although this was not confirmed by any other source. The operation prompted Russia to order new military exercises in regions bordering Ukraine. NATO has estimated its deployment at 40000 troops. "We are compelled to react to such a situation" Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian news agencies. "From today military exercises have started in regions bordering Ukraine involving battalions of tactical forces of the southern and western military districts." President Vladimir Putin had warned earlier on Thursday that there would be consequences if the Ukraine army was used against pro-Russian activists. "If Kiev really began to use the army against the country's population... that is a very serious crime against its own people" he said. The operation came hours after the government reported that its forces had taken control of the town hall in the city of Mariupol and repelled an attack on an army base in the eastern town of Artemivsk the ministries said. Separatist sources also reported the loss of the town hall in Mariupol. The city was the scene of a rebel attack on troops last week that left three rebels dead. The separatists had held the town hall since April 13. "The town hall is liberated and can function normally" Arsen Avakov Ukraine's interior minister said on his Facebook page. The Defence Ministry said in a statementthat Ukranian forces repelled nearly 100 separatists in an attack on the military base in Artemivsk just north of rebel-held Donetsk. "The attackers were repelled and suffered significant losses" Oleksandr TurchynovUkraine's actingpresident said. US President Barack Obama said on Thursday that Russia had failed to abide by the spirit of a deal to ease tensions in Ukraine and that new sanctions against Russia were being "teed up". He said "malicious armed men" continued to occupy buildings in eastern Ukraine in contradiction to a deal agreed last week in Geneva by Ukraine Russia the EU and the US. Barnaby Phillips and Peter Sharp report "So far we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva" Obama said. If that continued he said "there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions". On Wednesday Sergey Lavrov the Russian foreign minister warned that Russia would respond if its interests were threatened and made reference to Russias invasion of Georgia in 2008 after Georgian forces attacked separatists in its pro-Moscow region of South Ossetia.

The United States has imposed sanctions on seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a fresh attempt to force Moscow to back down from its intervention in Ukraine. The White House on Monday said the third round of sanctions in response to the Ukraine crisis was prompted by Moscow's failure to adhere to an April 17 agreement in Geneva on ways to resolve the situation. Officials made clear that sanctions against key sections of Russia's economy will be imposed including the energy and defence sections should Russia send troops massed along the Ukraine border into eastern Ukraine. The seven Russians sanctioned include two Putin allies: Igor Sechin head of Russia's major oil company Rosneft and Sergei Chemezov head of Rostec a Russian state-owned high-tech products company. The 17 companies will be subject to an asset freeze. Russia's Volga Group one of the targeted companies said on Monday that Washington's measures were "politically motivated statements and decisions". The other people named on Monday were Oleg Belavencev who is Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea Dmitry Kozak deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation Evgeniy Murov director of Russia's federal protective service and an army general Aleksei Pushkov a state Duma deputy and Vyacheslav Volodin a Putin adviser. The White House said that Washington would also deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. EU action The US decision coincided with a preliminary agreement reached by European leaders to impose asset freezes and visa bans on 15 more people. The names of those to be added to the list will not be made public until they are published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday. The US has been much more aggressive in the penalties it has imposed on Russia than has the 28-nation European Union which depends heavily on Russia for energy. The EU has previously imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 33 Russians and Crimeans for their part in Russia's seizure of Crimea last month. Armed separatists loyal to Russia have been seeking more autonomy in eastern Ukraine where they haveseized government buildings set up roadblocks or staged protests. On Monday Hennady Kernes the mayor of Kharkiv the countrys second largest city was shot by gunmen and was said to be undergoing surgery according to his office. Kernes was a staunch opponent of the pro-West Maidan movement that toppled President Viktor Yanukovich in February and was widely viewed as the organiser of activists sent to Kiev from eastern Ukraine to harass those demonstrators. But he has since softened his stance towards the new Kiev government and insisted that he does not support the pro-Russia separatists or any annexation of Ukrainian territory.

Manila - US President Barack Obama hasarrived in the Philippines in a visit widely seen as a part of Washington's "pivot to Asia strategy." Obama landed justhours after Philippine Defence Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg signed a new military agreement allowing more troops in the country. The Philippine government said the pact was an affirmation "of the robust and enduring strategic partnership between" the two allies. Talking to reporters in Manila Goldberg said that the new agreement would not allow the reopening of US bases in the Philippines something that has been opposed by nationalist forces and is prohibited by the 1987 Constitution. In Depth: US and Philippines sign ten-year defence pact No way home for Filipino 'Amerasians' Toxic trail shadows US-Philippine bases deal But the agreement essentially allows US access to Philippine military bases across the country. Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago chairman of the PhilippinesSenate Committee on Foreign Affairs told Al Jazeera that the agreement has "marginal advantages" for the country and is more beneficial to the US. With the signing of the agreement Santiago said the US "could claim that it has 'contained' China because the Asian countries involved including the Philippines are now bound by their respective agreements with America". "It would make the Philippines sounds as if we are a satellite ally of America" she said. During a joint press conference with the Philippine president President Obama said he goal of the US was not to contain China. "We welcome China's peaceful rise. We have a constructive relationship with China" Obama said. "Our goal is not to counter China our goal is not to contain China. Our goal is to make international rules and norms are respected and that includes areas of maritime disputes. "Our primary interest is the peaceful resolution of conflict including navigation that allows for continued progress and prosperity. We continue to stand shoulder to shoulder to uphold peace and security in this region and around the world." Philippines president Benigno Aquino said the agreement "reaffirms our countries commitment to mutual defense and security and promotes regional peace and stability." "Both President Obama and I share the conviction that territorial and maritime disputes in the Asia-Pacific region should be settled peacefully based on international law. We affirm that arbitration is an open friendly and peaceful approach to seeking a just and durable solution" he said. Disputes with China Anti-China sentiments have been on the rise in the Philippines which is engaged with Beijing over disputed atolls in the potentially oil- and gas-rich South China Sea with both countries claiming Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal as their own. The Philippines has accusedBeijing of becoming increasingly aggressive in staking its claims to the sea and has called on the US for greater military as well as diplomatic support. China and the Philippines are stuck in territorial dispute While the treaty is seen to boost Manila's confidence in countering the Chinese power Santiago warned that the country must be careful in handling the agreement and avoid the violation of the Philippines constitution. "Filipinos should keep uppermost the supremacy of the Philippine Constitution" she said. "We should not accommodate any foreign power at the cost of the sovereignty of our Constitution even if the problem is presented as if it were a problem of national survival." Activists opposing what they call "US imperialism in Asia" raise the question of sovereignty. They cite a case in 2005 whenfive US soldiers were initially sentenced to life in prison for allegedly raping a Filipino woman before the ruling was overturned by another court and they were set free despite public anger. Another issue that has spiked contempt is the alleged dumping of toxic waste in the northern Philippines supposedly by US military ships which Washington denies. 'Exaggerated threat' Jose Maria Sison the exiled leader of the Communist Party of the Philippines and one of the top opponents of the deal told Al Jazeera that the agreement practically reopens the US bases in the country. "The US military bases shall be practically re-established under the guise of facilities built on Philippine military grounds with the Filipino military personnel practically serving as perimeter security guards and with the Philippine government sharing the costs" he said. Sisonalso said the US "is exaggerating the threat of Chinese aggression in order to justify its pivot to East Asia" while establishing bases in the Philippines and "at the same time claiming neutrality between The Philippines and China". Buthe also said that China "is not helping itself by outlandishly claiming about 90 per cent of the entire South China Sea including its high seas and threatening to grab 90 per cent of the exclusive economic zone and 100 per cent of the extended continental shelf of the Philippines". Speaking toAl Jazeera Dr Francisco Nemenzo a political scientist and former president of the University of the Philippines criticised the negotiators for concealing the details of the agreement. Nemenzo saidthe deal "just legitimises what they [the US] have been doing all these years: allowing the establishment of an American base within a Philippine base which a Filipino commander cannot even enter. "We want to know if the deal is a blanket agreement allowing the US to set up a military facility wherever they want to." Security around the capital for the two-day visit is tight including the ordering of a no-fly zone by the Philippine government during the arrival of Air Force Once.

A group of eight European military observers being held prisoner by pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine have appeared in public for the first time since their capture and gave assurances that they were not being mistreated. Seven officers from the observer team and their translator were brought into a room of waiting journalists in the separatist-held administration building in the city of Slovyansk on Sunday. Guards in camouflage fatigues and balaclavas carrying Kalashnikov rifles were also in the room as journalists spoke to the observers. Colonel Axel Schneider from Germany who appeared nervous as he spoke for the group stressed they were on a diplomatic mission under the auspices of the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) when they were detained on Friday and were not spying for NATO as the separatists claim. Schneider said he understood that the self-proclaimed city mayor Vyacheslav Ponomaryov could use the observers as a bargaining chip. Later one of the men a Swedish national was released by the group on medical grounds. "He has a mild form of diabetes and so we decided to let him go"Stella Korosheva a spokeswoman for the separatist mayor told reporters. Ponomaryov said on Saturday that they could be released in exchange for jailed pro-Russia activists and told reporters that he was heading into talks with the mediators. "In our town where a war situation is going on any military personnel who don't have our permission are considered prisoners of war" he told reporters. Ponomaryov said he was preparing to meet OSCE mediators to negotiate the terms of the group's release. "The mayor of this city granted us his protection and he regarded us as his guests" Schneider told journalists in Slovyansk in eastern Ukraine. "We were accommodated in a cellar. We had to set up conditions for ourselves" said Schneider describing what happened after they were seized. "Since yesterday we've been in a more comfortable room with heating. We have daylight and an air conditioner." "I can tell you that the word of the mayor is a word of honour. We have not been touched." Schneider told reporters that none of the European delegation were sick. "We have no indication when we will be sent home to our countries" Schneider said. "We wish from the bottom of ourhearts to go back to our nations as soon and as quickly as possible." Ponomaryov who was wearing a pistol in a holster and was escorted by two armed bodyguards claimed in the interview that the OSCE observers "are not our hostages -- they are our guests". Asked about Russia's promise to do everything it could to convince the pro-Kremlin rebels in Slovyansk to release the OSCE military observers Ponomaryov said he had "no direct contact with Moscow." Three members of Ukraine's special forces bearing signs of torture have been paraded before the media [Al Jazeera] Captured officers Ponomaryov also said that pro-Russian separatists had separately "arrested" three Ukrainian officers a colonel a major and a captain he said had been sent towards Slovyansk on a spying mission. "There were a total of seven in their group and we arrested three of them. We will swiftly get the four others" he said. Footage has emerged showing the three captured officers bearing signs of torture being paraded before the media in Slovyansk. Ukraine's SBU security service confirmed the three officers had been seized. The rebel mayor said there would be no contact with Kiev over the imprisoned Ukrainians because the pro-Kremlin separatists see the capital's Western-backed government as illegitimate. "There will be no contact with Kiev only through the intermediary of the OSCE" he said. Ukraine's authorities he said "understand only the language of force."
