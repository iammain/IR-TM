Ukraine's government has said its troops have killed five "terrorists" in operations to take back the pro-Russian stronghold of Slovyansk an operation which has prompted Russia to order new military exercises on the Ukrainian border. The Ukrainian interior ministry said on Thursday that the pro-Russian rebelswere killed as paratroopers took over three "illegal checkpoints" around the town which has been in separatist control for almost two weeks.

The separatists had held the town hall since April 13. "The town hall is liberated and can function normally" Arsen Avakov Ukraine's interior minister said on his Facebook page. The Defence Ministry said in a statementthat Ukranian forces repelled nearly 100 separatists in an attack on the military base in Artemivsk just north of rebel-held Donetsk.

Barnaby Phillips and Peter Sharp report "So far we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva" Obama said. If that continued he said "there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions".
