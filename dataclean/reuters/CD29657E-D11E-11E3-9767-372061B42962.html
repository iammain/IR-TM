The Tsarnaev brothers came from the southern Caucasus where some islamic extremists have fought against Russia for years. Further one of Osama bin Ladens six reasons for the September 11th attacks was that the US did not force Russia out of the southern Caucasus. These terrorists are supported by al Qaeda but the US may need another September 11th attack to wake up and understand that Russia is a de facto military ally of the US. Russia was Americas ally in WWII when it fought two thirds of Hitlers war machine while the US Britain and others tied down one third of the NAZIs in their western and southern fronts. The US and future NATO countries did not adopt the political system of Russia during or after WWII and they need NOT adopt Russias political system today but the West could use Russias manpower its alliance with China with Beijings manpower the worlds biggest oil and gas station in Russian Siberia and the worlds biggest industrial manufacturing facilities in China. If Russia is some kind of ally then we really have another holy mess. Afghanistan is supposedly our ally but continues to try brow beat the US what we are doing there. Maybe it is time to back off or out of some these fights. If the people dont want us then get out. If they do want our help then they should not put so many conditions on what we do that we become nothing more than a target. We should have learned our lesson about playing world cop and target in Viet Nam. When will we learn? When is Putin granting Dagestan and Chechnya a vote to see if they want to remain part of Russia?
