Opposition leader Alexei Navalny talks to the media after leaving a justice court building in Moscow April 22 2014. MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court rejected a request by prosecutors to put Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny behind bars during a second trial on theft charges leaving one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics under house arrest. Navalny who is serving a five-year suspended sentence on a theft conviction he says was Putin's revenge for his opposition could be jailed for years if found guilty of stealing more than 30 million roubles ($840200) from two companies through fraud. But the judge's decision to prolong his house arrest instead of moving him to a detention facility as prosecutors and prison authorities had requested suggests the Kremlin is concerned that jailing him could cause protests. After gaining prominence with an on-line crusade against the corruption that he says permeates Putin's government Navalny emerged from a wave of street protests in 2011-2012 as Russia's most popular opposition leader. The initial theft conviction prevents Navalny 37 from running for office for years. He startled the Kremlin with a strong second-place showing in a Moscow mayoral election last year. Putin weathered the protests to win a third presidential term in 2012 and critics say the legal pressure on Navalny is part of a intensified clampdown on dissent since his return to the Kremlin. Putin denies he interferes in court cases. (Writing by Steve Gutterman; Editing by Angus MacSwan) We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion anecdotes links and data.
