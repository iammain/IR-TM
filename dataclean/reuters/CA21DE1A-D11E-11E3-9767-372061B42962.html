New group #CubaNow tells Obama it's time to change Cuba policy 1 of 5.

MIAMI (Reuters) - A new advocacy group calling for the United States to change its policy toward Cuba launched an advertising campaign on Monday with posters on the Washington D.C. metro system showing President Barack Obama and urging him to "stop waiting." The metro ads by the group #CubaNow are designed to highlight economic changes happening in Cuba. The group believes the 52-year-old U.S. embargo against the communist-ruled island has not worked. "It's time to bring the conversation on U.S.-Cuba policy into the 21st century" said #CubaNow director Ric Herrero. The group said its mission unlike other Cuba policy groups was specifically focused on changing U.S. thinking about Cuba policy. While the group opposes the embargo it recognized that overturning it in Congress is an uphill battle and other ways can be found to change policy such as allowing all Americans to travel to Cuba. "There's plenty the President can do within his existing authority" said #CubaNow founding member Andres Daz a Cuban-born former Obama administration official at the Department of Commerce. #CubaNow was founded by a group of mostly younger generation Cuban Americans. Herrero declined to discuss its funding. The group's launch coincides with the fifth anniversary of Obama's 2009 steps allowing Cuban-Americans to travel freely to visit relatives in Cuba as well as send remittances. That policy shift helped "usher in more change in that time than had been seen in the previous 50 years" the group said in a press release. Herrero said the group based in Miami and Washington wants the White House to take "new steps" to encourage Cuba's burgeoning private sector which has emerged under economic reforms being slowly introduced by the Cuban government. Cuba announced new reforms on Monday loosening regulation of its largest state-run companies including minerals tourism and telecommunications. The group's founding is part of a new wave of efforts to prod Obama into taking bolder steps to engage the Cuban government. It follows a February poll by the Atlantic Council which found a majority of Americans support normalizing relations with Cuba. In November Obama told a Miami area fundraiser that it may be time for the United States to "update" its policies toward Cuba. "Blue jeans and rockn roll brought down the Berlin Wall so we have to recognize that there is a new wave of energy pushing a new approach toward U.S.-Cuba policy" said Alex Castellanos a Republican political strategist who is Cuban American.

For more information on our comment policy see  It is time to end this completely unjustified embargo. The policy is so blatantly hypocritical. How can the US engage so openly with the Chinese communist regime (which has an equally poor if not more serious record of human rights violations than the Castro government) and then continue to punish Cubans for clinging to the same communist system? It is far more effective to engage your neighbors rather than to punish them (the population collectively I might add) over archaic Cold War sentiments that are completely non-sensical and absurd this day and age. So they want to take the heat off the embargo and concentrate on The embargo is a moral abomination that been repeatedly condemned even by the USAs closest allies at the UN and by groups like Amnesty International. Targeting every man woman and child on the island as it does it is morally and legally a form of genocide. The elephant in the room but that is the point that must be driven home to American voters. They must know what criminals their leaders are.
